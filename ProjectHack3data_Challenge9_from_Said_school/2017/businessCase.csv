This is accomplished by uniquely identifying animals, either individually or by group/lot, and recording their movements within a production chain. The speed with which one can access critical animal location and movement information, subsequently referred to as trace back data, determines the timeliness and effectiveness of a particular disease control and containment effort. The Animal Disease Traceability Information System (ADTIS) [formerly NAIS] supports animal disease traceability activities related to animal identification, movements and locations where animals are managed. It is implemented by the USDA and State agencies in cooperation with industry to enable timely trace back of the movement of diseased or exposed animal. Animal disease traceability helps to ensure rapid disease containment and maximum protection of Americas animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture s (USDA) animal disease traceability framework is a cooperative effort to identify animals and to utilize movement documentation of livestock that move interstate. The ADT embraces the strengths and expertise of States, Tribes, and producers and empowers them to find and use the most effective traceability approaches to identify animals moving interstate nationally. Moreover, this approach builds on the success of disease programs. USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has experienced successful traceability through the identification methods used in disease eradication programs. The ADTIS is the primary USDA Investment supporting the USDA traceability framework. Stakeholders are. U.S. Animal Health Association American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, State and Federal animal health officials, Accredited Veterinarians, Producers and livestock markets and National/International consumers. The ADTIS contains four major modules:  Standardized Premises Identification System (SPIS), Premises Allocator/ Repository, Animal Identification Management System (AIMS) and the Animal Tracing Processing System (ATPS). Additionally, the Animal Health Event Repository (AHER) is a data mart/warehouse like data store for a subset of the application data. Software has been deployed to support premises identification and animal identification. punctuation.",005-051,"841 - Protect Agricultural Health by Minimizing Major Diseases and Pests to Ensure Access to Safe, Plentiful, and Nutritious Food","As a result of ADTIS [formerly NAIS], the Federal and State governments savings in connection with the administration of animal disease control and eradication programs are significant, but they are only part of the overall benefits. Economic benefits in both the domestic and international marketplace resulting from enhanced traceability may be greater than the cost savings realized during animal disease control and eradication efforts. For industry, the effect of not implementing some aspects of ADTIS  may result in significant losses as great as $1.32 billion on average per year over a 10-year period due mostly to reduced export market access. Implementation of ADTIS becomes more cost effective as participation levels increase and actually may not be economically viable at lower participation levels. The cattle industry cost represents 91.5 percent of the total cost of ADTIS for the primary food animal species (cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry). Identification tags and tagging cattle represent 75 percent of the cattle sectors annual adoption cost. Tags and tagging costs vary among cattle producers with 50 head from $3.30 to $5.22 per cow, depending on current identification practices. The total cost for implementing ADTIS in the cattle sector as described in the study is $175.9 million annually (at a 90 percent participation level). Although significant, the cost is less than one-half of a percent of the retail value of U.S. beef products. The swine and poultry industries each have a lower cost because animal tracing requirements for these species require less infrastructure and often no individual identification devices.

Through its long history of service to agricultural communities, FSA has developed an expansive network of partnerships with agricultural stakeholder organizations and interests.  These partnerships are routinely leveraged for cooperative outreach to customers in a program- or initiative-specific manner.  As a result, in challenging times and crisis situations FSA is routinely seen by partner agencies as a reliable and needed source of information and support for farmers and ranchers, nationwide.  The long-standing COC system further establishes FSA as a grass-roots organization, invested in supporting local agricultural communities.

Despite its expansive reach across rural America, FSA does not have a comprehensive and unified information technology (IT) investment to efficiently and effectively manage its relationships with existing customers, or identify and reach prospective customers and underserved communities.

The GSS also includes the annual Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The base GSS supports the collection of boundaries required to support estimates in demographic and economic areas (covering approximately 35% of functioning governments). The Decennial Census traditionally provides resources to collect the boundaries for the other 26,000 governments.

Work to improve addresses includes the Community Address Updating System (CAUS), which supports the GSS Initiative through fieldwork limited to selected blocks that provide indicators of the challenges of rural addresses.  Addresses collected through the CAUS additionally support the American Community Survey (ACS).  

Along with the ongoing efforts of the GSS Initiative to provide an up-to-date address list and increase the efficiency of field staff working on ongoing surveys, the GSS Initiative is critical to conducting a selective address canvassing operation (as opposed to a full, or 100 percent, address canvassing operation) in support of the 2020 Census.

In order to meet this goal, the Census Bureau must invest early in our research and testing.  If we cannot fund development, test and research activities in FY 15 regarding innovations to reduce the workload and achieve cost savings, then we will be forced to either implement innovation for the 2020 Census design at greater risk to the census, or make operational design decisions based on a costly, traditional paradigm used in previous censuses, with an increased follow-up workload thus increasing the costs of the 2020 Census.

It was founded upon, aligned with, and is inclusive of tactics and activities from the U.S. Census Bureau's Strategic Plan 2013 2017 which is aligned with the goal and objectives of the Department of Commerce Strategic Plan. 
The Census Bureau ADITCIO has designated three priorities for FY2016.  They include, the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing (CEDCaP) program, the continued implementation and maturation of the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), and IT Security.

CEDCaP is an initiative to create an integrated and standardized system of systems that will offer shared data collection and processing services across all operations and consolidate costs by retiring unique, survey-specific systems and redundant capabilities and bring a much greater portion of the Census Bureau s total IT expenditures under a single, integrated and centrally managed program.  It will also halt the creation of program-specific systems and put in place a solution that will be mature and proven for the 2020 Census. 

VDI technology is enabling Census to realize cost and operational efficiencies in terms of desktop hardware management, customer support, and office application software licensing.  VDI affords a secure method for allowing users to access their tools and data including Title data anywhere, anytime, improving the users desktop experience and increasing their overall productivity.

BEA collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies, and disseminates statistics to the public. BEA's single mission area is supported by one major system, the BEA Estimation IT System (BEA-EITS), which is a portfolio of highly integrated and interdependent statistical and economic estimation subsystems. This system encompasses the Bureau's core economic processing system and is the primary tool used in the production of the BEA's economic accounts. The BEA-EITS forms the technological foundation for achieving the strategic and performance goals of improved timeliness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of BEA's economic statistical releases. 

Rapid and far-reaching changes in the economy, loss of key source data, and the ongoing need to update concepts and estimation methods drive BEA's Strategic Plan. This Plan emphasizes four key objectives:1) Efficiently manage IT investments in support of BEA's mission, vision, and strategic objectives; 2) Redesign core systems and applications to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and comprehensives of Bureau outputs; 3) Standardize data structures and databases to use web-technologies to improve the collection, access, and dissemination of data; and 4) Maintain infrastructure to ensure reliability and security. Ongoing upgrades to the various components of the BEA-EITS are driven by BEA's strategic goals and objectives.

(ESA, BEA, Census, BIS, ITA, MBDA)","The Bureau of Economic Analysis produces economic accounts statistics that enable government and business decision-makers, researchers, and the American public to follow and understand the performance of the Nation's economy. Although it is a relatively small agency, BEA produces some of the most closely watched economic statistics that influence the decisions made by government officials, businesses, and individuals. BEA's economic statistics, which provide a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the U.S. economy, are key ingredients in critical decisions affecting monetary policy, tax and budget projections, and business investment plans. The cornerstone of BEA's statistics is the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), which feature the estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) and related measures.

Relatively small investments in improvements to BEA accounts can potentially have very large effects. If the more accurate data flowing from these investments were to raise today's GDP growth by as little as 1/100 of 1 percentage point, it would raise GDP by $1.5 billion each year. The budgetary effects of a 1% lower projection of real GDP growth could increase the deficit by $3.5 trillion over 10 years. Over $330B of Federal Funds are allocated to states based on BEA data and over 20 states have statutory limits on revenues and spending tied to BEA's state personal income statistics or some of its components.

This investment does not include DME funding for the statistical production modernization program, which was included in the President's budget for FY15 at $3 million per year.

All tasks are managed and measured through a single, consistent, objective federal staff administered EVM process.  The process has proven to be accurate and effective on a monthly basis since the project was restarted and re-baselined in June 2005; the results have been verified through formal Technical Review Boards attended by the DOC OCFO, OCIO, contracting officers, and the IG.
      The following factors drive this approach: 1.The program is not a new fixed price development initiative; it is a restarted program to replace a legacy system.  The vendors, often through level of effort tasking, by definition must make use of previous vendor deliverables, some 20 years or older, often of poor quality and completeness; 2.The program first priority is to maintain existing system functionality until the Legacy system can be replaced.  As such it is required to adapt to unpredictable changes in scope.  3.The program requires cooperation, and close coordination from the multiple vendors; the nature of the effort to replace the 20 year old Legacy system requires teamwork and sharing of information, expertise and deliverables, such that the task and deliverable of one contractor must often be sacrificed to support the larger program objective. 4.Small effort size. The CUESS application system development effort originally had a maximum annual investment of $ 2.5 million including hardware and software infrastructure purchased by the government; new externally driven security specific costs drove the total to $ 4.5M in 2007.  The funding is spread among several vendors, each with 1 to 10 staff persons, depending on the project stage.  The overhead to require each vendor to calculate individual EVM, and then to roll that up into the consolidated EVM for the program, is out of proportion for the level of effort. Therefore vendors provide EVM related inputs to the government project management office; EVM is consistently and independently calculated for the overall program by the government.
    BIS has a multi-year track record demonstrating this strategy and EVM approach is effective and has successfully delivered multiple programs on schedule and within budget for each year since 2005.

The system has been in its Operations and Maintenance phase of its lifecycle since 1999, and is critical to the National Weather Service's mission related to the preservation of life and property from severe weather and flooding events, and the enhancement of the national economy.   AWIPS O&amp;M funding is at approximately $39.0 million per year.  AWIPS is in the O&amp;M phase of its lifecycle, but contains a PAC funded Continuous Technology Refresh (CTR) product improvement plan that includes a project to restructure the AWIPS software into a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).   AWIPS PAC funds will be used to continue to infuse new science and technology into the AWIPS system. This technology infusion consists of separate projects that address three different areas of the AWIPS infrastructure: hardware, communications, and software. The hardware enhancements converted the original (dated) Hewlett-Packard Unix hardware to Linux based hardware to provide increased processing and mass storage capacity, and then continuously refresh the hardware on a cyclical basis; the communications enhancements increase satellite network bandwidth; and the software enhancement will re-engineer the AWIPS software suite into a standard Service Oriented Architecture making it easier and less expensive to integrate improved scienceS  and algorithms into AWIPS, while reducing software O&amp;M costs. This AWIPS Product Improvement (API) strategy is designed to increase system performance while reducing maintenance costs and processing latency. AWIPS collects, communicates, processes, displays, and analyzes hydro-meteorological data that is fundamental to the conduct of the NWS mission.

MIDS-LVT is a multinational (U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Spain) cooperative development program with joint service participation (Navy, Army, Air Force). The Department of Defense (DoD) and US international allies highlighted the need for a Link 16 voice and data communications terminal that was lower volume and lighter weight than other available Link 16 radios. The MIDS program was created to fill the gap by providing a reduced volume/weight radio with Link 16 capability. MIDS-LVT is interoperable with North Atlantic Treaty Org users and increases force effectiveness while minimizing hostile actions and friend-on-friend engagements. There are more than 9000 MIDS terminals in use/on contract worldwide (40 Nations/Agencies).  
In selected DOD systems, MIDS-LVT is migrating to a MIDS JTRS four-channel, Software Communications Architecture compliant radio that maintains Link 16 and Tactical Air Navigation functionality. The MIDS JTRS design is interchangeable with MIDS-LVT. MIDS JTRS accommodates future capabilities and closes numerous Agency performance gaps. It adds improvements to Link 16 enhanced throughput, frequency re-mapping and programmable crypto. MIDS JTRS will also provide Four Net Concurrent Multi-Netting with Concurrent Contention Receive and utilizes Tactical Targeting Network Technology for MIDS JTRS Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air and From the Air Advanced Tactical Data Links. These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link 16 Nets.

It also enables Navy compliance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process. Additionally, Navy ERP will be a key enabler for Navy to achieve auditability. 

Navy will realize benefits on many levels. The first major benefit will be realized through legacy system retirement cost avoidance. The system has enabled the retirement of 80 systems and applications to date, with 8 more to be retired by 2016, generating a cumulative cost avoidance of ~ $1,103M by the end of FY19.  Additionally, the Single Supply Solution is expected to bring $505M in Inventory Savings by the end of FY19.  Data validation at time of entry, electronic archiving, increased electronic workflow, system audit trails and standardized report generation are just some of the benefits that will increase business process efficiencies and improve internal control across Systems Commands. 

The ability to rapidly determine operating force logistical needs and to respond quickly to those requirements through an integrated ERP system is paramount. Navy ERP creates a solution that allows rapid access to information on finances, material, personnel, and other end-to-end process information.

The purpose of the Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) is to receive, process, analyze, and disseminate meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) environmental data and products to DoD users (primarily), other federal agencies, and international partners.  The current and continued anticipated benefit of POPS is that it provides the means to take the collected METOC data, analyze this data to develop a coherent depiction of the current and future predicted natural physical environment, supporting both combat and non-combat operations.

POPS provides (1) a high-performance computing capability needed to enable predictive modeling of the world oceans and the marine atmosphere to the degree of accuracy and resolution required to satisfy Naval warfare requirements and (2) integrated information technology resources for METOC data acquisition, processing, analysis, and delivery of METOC information, products/services to the Navy and Joint Forces for military operations, and national and international partners for humanitarian support.

Key goals of the POPS program are:

- Run state-of-the-art environmental models to support, for example: optimal aircraft routing and safe and direct ship routing; hurricane, tsunami, and tropical storm prediction; dust storm, volcanic plume and fire/smoke tracking; ice thickness prediction; open ocean and coastal wave prediction; ballistic missile targeting support; search and rescue support; and low level chemical, biological, and nuclear atmospheric release prediction.

- Provide METOC analysis and forecasting products to aid the Warfighter in making faster and more informed mission-related decisions and maintain interoperability with Navy and DoD command and control (C2) systems.

- Increase resolution and forecast extent of METOC models; implement methods to ingest new/next generation data from environmental sensors; improve product delivery through visualization and secure communications; implement data/product archival and retrieval system; improve data management (ashore and afloat); and implement coupled atmosphere/ocean modeling.

Fully deployed, RCAS links Army National Guard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) units located in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, US Territories, Europe and the Pacific Rim.
  
The RCAS was certified as compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act throughout its acquisition phase.  Now fully operational and in sustainment, the RCAS is the system of record for all states and territories mobilizing their citizen Soldiers for contingency operations and serves as a Commander's readiness tool for unit and individual soldiers preparedness to deploy anytime, anywhere.  This investment dramatically improves the RC''s ability to mobilize forces in half the historical time and provides resource visibility to state and federal agencies of forces at home and abroad.    

Primary customers and beneficiaries of this system are the full-time manning personnel in the ARNG and USAR and traditional RC leadership from the Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) down to the unit level who utilize RCAS software (SW) for personnel management, retirements points accounting, force management, safety management and mobilization planning/execution.

Benefits include improved decision-making and better information management due to the increased accessibility, flexibility and knowledge sharing that the system provides; a stable, reliable and responsive architecture that supports the RC''s needs and improves mission effectiveness, interoperability and operational readiness of RC IT systems; and enhanced visibility of RC availability and readiness to FORSCOM.",007-019,"440 - Improve energy performance., 72511 - Rebalance the Joint Force for a broad spectrum of conflict.","The RCAS successfully completed its Milestone III in 2003 with a documented ROI of 6.6:1 and in 2005 completed a Post Deployment Performance Review (PDPR) that resulted in an ROI of 4.28:1.  The PDPR consisted of a four-phased approach to identify RCAS objectives, collect cost and benefit data, analyze operational performance, and evaluate actual performance against acquisition estimates.  To gather system and economic data, the PDPR Team utilized methods consistent with previous Cost Benefit Analyses; specifically, the Team distributed surveys, interviewed Subject Matter Experts (SME), conducted site visits, and utilized Program documentation.

The Army mission is supported by the functions of mobilization planning and execution, monitoring unit status, implementing mobilization plans, deployment and demobilization.

By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing technology, DoD''s science and technology (S&T) and test and evaluation (T&E) programs communities are able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems quickly and with more precision.  The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by improving weapons system designs through an increased fundamental understanding of materials, aerodynamics, chemistry, fuels, acoustics, signal image recognition, electromagnetics, and other areas of basic and applied research as well as enabling advanced test and evaluation environments that allow synthetic scene generation, automatic control systems and virtual test environments.  As such, HPC has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD''s science and technology (S&T) and test and evaluation (T&E) programs.  The program deploys supercomputers to provide world-class HPC capability to a nation-wide user community.  Customers are scientists and engineers throughout DoD, and major stakeholders are the DoD S&T and T&E communities.  All Services are the beneficiaries of technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield enabled by the HPC Modernization Program.

The HPC Modernization program provides focused modernization efforts crafted to ensure DoD''s science and technology and test and evaluation communities are supported with current generation supercomputing capabilities.  The HPC modernization program resulted from congressional language that recognized supercomputing as a national strategic asset and directed the DoD to focus on supercomputing modernization at DoD laboratories and test centers to keep its forces and military systems on the leading technological edge.",007-055,"440 - Improve energy performance., 72611 -  Seek innovative approaches to improve cyber capability against growing threats.","Providing a definitive assessment of the impact of a program as diverse as the HPCMP is difficult. By its nature the HPCMP is an infrastructure program that enables the success of the entire Science and Technology (S&T) and Test and Evaluation (T&E) portfolios of the Department. To help quantify the impact of the HPCMP, the Program conducted a return on investment (ROI) analysis during a three-phase study that concluded in 2009 and was validated by the National Defense University. The study examined the investments and returns for three HPC project portfolios: Army/Anti-Armor, Climate/Weather/Ocean (CWO), and Air Vehicles. The CWO portfolio encompasses projects that provide DoD real-time, high-resolution weather and oceanographic forecasts; and realistic simulations of the dynamic oceanic and atmospheric environment to permit effective mission planning, rehearsal and training, and materiel acquisition. Air Vehicles, encompasses projects that use HPC-enabled modeling and simulation to reduce risk, enhance performance and flying qualities, predict service life, and determine airworthiness qualifications. 
Each ROI assessment process culminated with the preparation and presentation of a comprehensive ROI briefing to the DoD senior-level HPCMP Overarching Integrated Product Team/Configuration Steering Board (OIPT/CSB) meeting during the second quarter of each fiscal year. The full study is quite detailed, encompassing a wide variety of projects in each portfolio. For every dollar invested in HPCMP resources in support of the Armor/Anti-Armor, CWO, and Air Vehicles portfolios, the return on the investment is between $6.78 and $12.68. A return on investment approach that focuses on dollars is an important part of assessing the overall value of the HPCMP, but it is not the only important measure. Other measures include the impact of HPCMP services and expertise on the S&T and T&E activities of the Department. 
Examples include:

GCSS-Army will modernize logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, logistics management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  This effort will implement a comprehensive logistics automated solution for the Army and provide the commander on and off the battlefield with an integrated and interoperable end-to-end view of the logistics chain, equipment status and asset visibility to support decisions that will affect the outcome of combat operations, combat power and planning for future operations.  This solution implements Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products from the company System, Application and Product, Aktiengesellschaft (SAP AG).  This will also allow the Army to retire multiple custom designed standalone business software baselines optimized to existing Army business processes and replace them with a single integrated business software baseline that has been optimized to industry defined best business practices.

-	Estimated Class II (Individual equipment), III (Fuel), IV (Construction materials) and IX (Repair parts/spares) inventory right-sizing benefit of $348.5M
-	Estimated inventory efficiencies of $370.4M due to improved reparable tracking and turn-ins
-	Estimated reduction in STAMIS IT costs of $1,003.7M
-	Estimated efficiencies in reorder costs, totaling $1,229.9M
-	Estimated Army efficiencies that will be obtained by personnel time or added value of services totaling $8,810.9M
The estimated benefit of $348.5M represents the right-sizing of inventory and was derived by looking at the Class II, III packaged, IV, and IX supplies at tactical & retail SSAs.  This one-time benefit represents a ""correction"" or ""right-sizing"" of inventory across the supply chain.  
The estimated inventory efficiencies of $370.4M in reparable turn-ins represents the efficiencies that the Army could achieve by reducing the number of items needed due to the execution of more efficient business processes.  Units will be able to identify, track, and turn-in a higher number of reparable items.  The ERP system will force the turn-in of old items before ordering new and give leaders visibility of the all repair items.  
The estimated efficiency in reorder costs of $1,229.9M represents the efficiencies that the Army could achieve by reducing costs with multiple reorders of lost, wrong, or delayed shipments. Units will be able to track and redirect shipments of items, including the actual descriptions of those items.  The ERP system will not allow the unit to reorder the same item, unless it''s for a separate effort or justification.

The current benefits of MPS include increasing the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles, conventional and low-observable aircraft, and weapons) by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision/autonomous guided munitions and increasing wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness.  

The goal of this re-capitalization initiative is to take advantage of the rapid increase in PC-based technology to enable high-end computing on increasingly smaller and more mission-oriented devices.  The various programs procure UNIX and PC-based mission planning computers, which provide a flexible, configurable, and cost effective solution for increasing tactical and strategic capabilities to meet the continuum of operations ranging from peacetime contingencies to conventional and nuclear wartime mission planning requirements.  Each program has shifted its hardware emphasis from a small number of large, complex planning systems to a larger number of smaller, more personal, planning devices tailored to user needs.

This exceeds the original ROI of 605%, from the July 2010 Economic Analysis.  Increment 2 achieved Full Deployment (FD) on 26 November 2013, so the subsequent 10 year sustainment phase for this new capability runs through 2023. 

BACKGROUND: The ISPAN PMO prepared an Economic Analysis (EA) in July 2010 to support the ISPAN Increment 2 Build Decision (Milestone B) for modernization of the Global Adaptive Planning (GAP) Collaborative Information Environment (CIE) suite of capabilities.  The EA was updated in August 2012 to provide a current assessment of the costs and benefits applicable to Increment 2 development including a revised Return on Investment (ROI) prior to the Full Deployment Decision Review (FDDR).  The ISPAN benefits analysis was conducted in accordance with the provisions outlined in OMB Circular A-94, AFM 65-506 and the OSD Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) Automated Information system Economic Analysis Guide.

Benefits Identification.  GAP CIE provides the Title 10 Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) with global collaborative planning capabilities that are called for in the 2011 Unified Command Plan, which reads, ""Commanders charged with synchronizing planning lead a global collaborative planning process that includes other Combatant Commanders, CSAs, and applicable Defense agencies and field activities in support of a designated global mission or campaign plan.""  Besides some savings in manpower cost avoidance, the primary quantifiable benefit from GAP CIE modernization will be avoidance of duplicative effort by CCDRs and other programs.  By leveraging the Enterprise, Increment 2 provides significant improvements in joint planning productivity and quality across DoD without adding operational personnel and without requiring potentially significant software development and IT investment by other CCDRs.  

Like the 2010 EA, USSTRATCOM worked with a panel of users, program managers, and functional managers to provide a current assessment of quantitative benefits and cost savings for Increment 2.  Based on capabilities completed the team confirmed the five cost avoidance and manpower saving categories previously identified in the 2010 EA are still viable economic benefits.",no,yes,no,,6.255,6.194,5.299,5.406,2010,2030,"Minor change in calculation of MILPERS.

MPS allows aircrews to electronically receive tasking orders, intelligence information, target coordinates, imagery and other information.  This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including cargo airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g., maps, charts, imagery, flight logs, radar predications, and navigation databases) that is electronically transferred to aircraft and weapons.  

The current benefits of MPS include increasing the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles, conventional and low-observable aircraft, and weapons) by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision/autonomous guided munitions and increasing wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness. 

The specific goal of this initiative is to now support sustainment activities for the F-22, the last Air Force platform with a requirement in this increment.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) for Increment IV was declared in 2013, with the initiative transitioning to sustainment in 2014 and consequently no longer submitting MAIS or Defense Acquisition Executive Summary (DAES) reports.

Section 6.0 of the EA states that the ROI was -.05 for Increments III and IV of a spiral development plan.  Milestone B approving authorities recognized that MPS EA was a National Security System (NSS) driven, not an ROI driven program.  The period of performance covers mainly the development of the new mission planning software and not the sustainment or long-term life cycle costs when cost savings would be expected.  In addition, benefits (Section 3.1 of the EA) of an open architecture system, (with expectation of moving to Network-Centric Enterprise Services in Increment IV) and software obsolescence (Section 1.0 of the EA) of 1990 legacy systems were not considered as cost factors.  The EA underscored how the benefits of MPS outweigh the slightly negative ROI.

The cost analysis determined that the cost increase for the new Mission Planning replacement system would be minimal.  The Mission Planning budget has been established and either the legacy systems or the MPS replacement will have to operate within the current budget.  Therefore it has been concluded that the ROI is indeed sufficient to support investment in the preferred alternative (see EA Section 5.0).  Section 4.4.2 of the EA states that MPS provides qualitative/quantifiable benefits.  However, these benefits were not factored into the ROI calculation.

The EA was based on the ISPAN CARD and the EA data was included in the SCP briefing to the Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group.  The EA explored the costs associated with maintaining the existing ISPAN to meet current and future requirements versus development of a modernized ISPAN to meet the requirements of the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review and the 2006 Unified Command Plan (UCP).  
The ISPAN benefits analysis was conducted in accordance with the provisions outlined in DoDI 7041.3, OMB Circular A-94, AFI 65-501, AFM 65-506 and the OSD (PA&E) Automated Information system Economic Analysis Guide.  The EA was developed in concert with USSTRATCOM Comptroller with the guidance of SAF/FM and AFCAA communities and approved by OSD PA&E.  

The total Net Present Value (NPV) investment in ISPAN as calculated in the April 04 Economic Analysis, was derived by deducting the Strategic War Planning System (SWPS) PV investment of $605.3M from the ISPAN PV investment of $824.9M without sunk cost, to derive an NPV investment of $219.6M.

The system represents the AF commitment to modernizing business practices and providing enhanced support for today''s service members and their families. AFIPPS will align with DoD data standards for personnel, pay, and accounting, including the Common Human Resource Information Standards (CHRIS), which will ensure compliance with the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). The AFIPPS program will be bound by using the BEA ""Hire-to-Retire"" (H2R) construct. Eighty-four percent of the BEA''s H2R activities are within the scope of AFIPPS.

The purpose of AFIPPS is to provide the AF with a sustainable, cost-effective, auditable, and regulatory compliant method of effectively capturing and maintaining personnel information so that Service members are paid accurately and on-time without requiring repetitive action or onerous paperwork, while allowing commanders/managers to easily access pertinent information.

The goal of AFIPPS, as documented in the Capability Development Document (CDD) signed 05 Jul 11, is to fully integrate personnel and pay management for the AF''s Total Force (Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFRes)). The future state will be characterized by streamlined, Total Force business processes; efficient and accurate management of pay entitlements; auditable financial statements with regard to military pay; improved access to accurate and timely personnel data for authorized users; and a modernized IT systems environment that is cost-effective and can adapt to future needs.

AFIPPS''s customers include approximately 620,000 AF Service members across all components, as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure Service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.

MPS allows aircrews to electronically receive tasking orders, intelligence information, target coordinates, imagery and other information.  This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including cargo airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g., maps, charts, imagery, flight logs, radar predications, and navigation databases) that is electronically transferred to aircraft and weapons.  

The current benefits of MPS include increasing the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles, conventional and low-observable aircraft, and weapons) by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision/autonomous guided munitions and increasing wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness. 

The specific goal of this initiative is to now sustain legacy systems (Unix-MPS, Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS), Common Low Observable Autorouter (CLOAR), and TaskView) for the C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-135, KC-10, HH-60,B-2, B-52, U-2, and Global Hawk.

Section 6.0 of the EA states that the ROI was -.05 for Increments III and IV of a spiral development plan.  Milestone B approving authorities recognized that MPS EA was a National Security System (NSS) driven, not an ROI driven program.  The period of performance covers mainly the development of the new mission planning software and not the sustainment or long-term life cycle costs when cost savings would be expected.  In addition, benefits (Section 3.1 of the EA) of an open architecture system, (with expectation of moving to Network-Centric Enterprise Services in Increment IV) and software obsolescence (Section 1.0 of the EA) of 1990 legacy systems were not considered as cost factors.  The EA underscored how the benefits of MPS outweigh the slightly negative ROI.

The cost analysis determined that the cost increase for the new Mission Planning replacement system would be minimal.  The Mission Planning budget has been established and either the legacy systems or the MPS replacement will have to operate within the current budget.  Therefore it has been concluded that the ROI is indeed sufficient to support investment in the preferred alternative (see EA Section 5.0).  Section 4.4.2 of the EA states that MPS provides qualitative/quantifiable benefits.  However, these benefits were not factored into the ROI calculation.

In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the Veterans Affairs (VA) in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program.
Secretary Hagel's Memorandum titled ""Integrated Electronic Health Records,"" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program:
- The Department of Defense (DoD) shall continue near-term coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near-term goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer-term goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization.
- DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization.

GCSS-J is a critical tool for the joint logistician as it provides them with the needed visibility and Decision Support Tools to plan, execute, and manage assets that support current and future operations.  The Director for Logistics, Joint Staff J-4 (DJ4) identified GCSS-J as the System of Record for Logistics and branded the application a logistics ""One Stop Shop.""  The value of GCSS-J is that it provides access, securely, to 26 disparate authoritative data sources via a web portal, thereby eliminating ""swivel-seat management"" which is the bane of the logistics community and the DJ4.  The value of eliminating swivel seat management is found in the reduction of man-hours and ease of use.  The time spent logging on to several authoritative data sources to gather and compile data to produce a report has been estimated to take 4 - 8 hours.  With GCSS-J, that same report can be produced in seconds and in the format designated by the individual combatant command (CCMD).  GCSS-J also provides the added feature of exporting data into briefable formats further enhancing GCSS-J's relevance and ability to provide a much needed capability.

As a secure, end-to-end IT system, the DISS will be the authoritative source for the management, storage, and timely dissemination of and access to personnel security information and will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DOD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies.  

The DISS family of systems is comprised of two components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS).  Once fully deployed, the DISS family of systems will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (DOD IT investment #6321), which contains approximately six million active security clearance records and supports over 80,000 users.  The DISS has also been designated as the repository for adjudicative results for Suitability and HSPD-12 determinations by the 13 July 2011 USD(I) memo ""Storage of Adjudicative Results in the Defense Information System for Security. 
   
The DISS (CATS) has been designated as the DoD non-Intelligence Community IT system for case management and adjudications by the 10 April 2009 USD(I) memo ""Designation of the DoD Case Management and Adjudication Systems.

The single greatest benefit GDSS provides is net-centricity.  The USTRANSCOM C2 system offers and utilizes information services/Web services over the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) and SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  The point of including the technical language is to show that information services are based on common standards rather than program manager negotiated interface definition documents.  Any properly authorized system will be able to use GDSS data and services with much less effort and cost than is currently required.  Additionally, a significant quantitative benefit of sustaining the system through logical software and hardware upgrades is the Operations and Support cost avoidance relative to retaining the Status Quo.  GDSS provides efficiency gains and enable personnel to become more efficient. A well designed IT system should allow staff to improve their work processes.  As documented in the current economic analysis, the following qualitative benefits were identified:
- Reduced system integration risk for future Releases - Will not create enhanced stovepipes. Therefore, the risk that inter-dependent systems with similar functions will not be developed in a way that is compatible is reduced.  
- Increased customer and employee satisfaction - GDSS modernization/enhancements will result in better tools that should boost employee morale and improve customer service.

Initial convergence discussions between DLA and USTRANSCOM began in May 2005. Similarities in requirements and a general inability to provide unity of effort with respect to integration of supply chain and distribution related data and information to users led to the decision by DLA and USTRANSCOM to converge the IDE and GTN programs. To facilitate convergence, a new program office under a single Program Executive Office (PEO) was established to ensure authority sufficient for responsibility and effective governance. The new program was tasked with planning, implementing, and managing convergence of the data brokering and functional supply/logistics information capabilities provided via the IDE and the transportation data access and functional capabilities of USTRANSCOM's GTN; delivering value to users across the DoD.

The convergence of these two programs created a single place within the DoD and between DLA and USTRANSCOM for consistent access to common, authoritative data, business standards, and information. Convergence  increased logistics information sharing across the DoD, provided improved reliability and responsiveness of data exchange, and enabled enhanced capabilities with respect to supply chain, distribution, and logistics planning & operations. Capitalizing on the core competencies of each command and leveraging existing systems, convergence eliminated redundancy, streamlined access to data, and optimized resources; enabling faster application development in support of informed and agile decision making.

The IDE/GTN Convergence (IGC) established a user-friendly, flexible and high performance supply chain, distribution, and operations data brokering infrastructure and decision-support environment for Warfighters and the organizations that support them.

Through the three phases of the procurement process - Phase 1 pre-award/award; Phase 2 contract administration; and Phase 3 contract close-out - SPS builds upon each procurement artifact starting with the Purchase Request and building the Solicitation/Amendments then Award/Modifications. SPS is used for simple acquisitions; Post, Camp and Station contracting; and some major weapons acquisitions.  

SPS has accomplished measurable progress in meeting the Business Value Added measures that the Defense Business Systems Management Committee is using to drive transformation at the Core Business Mission level. The impacts that SPS has accomplished are: 1) On Time Request: SPS standardizes the procurement process, improving contract data accuracy. 2) Cash-to-Cash: SPS provides contract data to Electronic Data Access (EDA), and downstream to Wide Area Workflow (WAWF), enabling a streamlined Receipt and Acceptance process. 3) Urgent Requests: SPS standardizes the procurement process through the use of an enterprise procurement system, which enables timely processing of urgent requisitions. SPS-Contingency improves contingency contracting tools by providing a mobile functional capability for support of in-theater business needs. 4) Financial Transparency: SPS standardizes the procurement process and provides standard interfaces with service financial systems and Enterprise Resource Programs thus improving financial data accuracy and financial traceability.

In 2006, EO 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet E.O. 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established.   
  
FHA serves in a coordinating and convening role across the federal agencies to support alignment of HIT investments. FHA also supports federal agency adoption of nationally-recognized standards and policies for efficient and secure health information exchange. These roles  have led to the CONNECT project, the Federal Health Interoperability Modeling and Standards (FHIMS) initiative (which includes development of a Federal Health Information Model (FHIM)), Federal Health Information Planning and Reporting (FHIPR) and other projects aimed at coordinating HIT activities across the federal space including Directed Exchange, Healthcare Directory, and Patient Consent & Authorization. FHA initiated FHIM to develop a comprehensive, integrated set of information standards that fully support health information interoperability. FHA created the FHIPR initiative to provide health IT specific guidance to agencies for the purposes of planning health IT investments and reporting to OMB. FHA also launched workgroups to address current federal requirements in the areas of Directed Exchange, Healthcare Directory and Patient Consent & Authorization. As requirements are met for these workgroups, more will be created to address other partner priority areas such as, the federal health interoperability metric initiative that will define, gather existing metric and consolidate to eventually report on outcome metrics. FHA is also working with its federal partners to evaluate and assess the federal health ecosystem in order to identify gaps and overlaps in capability; identify opportunities to achieve shared, interoperable solutions; and inform investment decisions of federal partners -- thus maximizing the nation’s health at optimal cost.",009-110,"689 - Enhance access to and use of data to improve HHS programs and support improvements in the health and well-being of the American people","The alternative selected during the FHA Cost-Benefit Analysis completed December 11, 2013 was to build out the FHA portion of the Federal Enterprise Architecture incrementally. This will provide the Federal agencies with the ability to identify cross functional processes, redundant systems, areas for collaboration, and the gaps in the interoperability of their critical information systems and infrastructure. The FHA will also provide a framework for linking health lines of business to their enabling technology solutions and standards, and for demonstrating how these solutions achieve health performance outcomes. The expected value of the ROI from the alternative selected is 413264%.  
 
This option provides an approach for establishing the FHA in an environment in which substantial EAs have already been developed by individual agencies.  However, this option requires the most architecture development and close coordination across the health communities of interest. Given that existing department/agency EAs exist, but are neither integrated nor consistent in the naming of architectural entities and modeling of their relationships, it is important to establish a common upper ground. Hence, top-level target business architecture across all Health line of business functional areas is developed.  The business architecture is developed in increments, starting at a very high level.  This business architecture will start using the extensions to the Health line of business sub-functions that the FHA effort identified.  These business sub-functions need to be “leveled” so that the granularity of each business process/activity is comparable.  The business architecture is refined into greater detail over time, but only to the degree that it captures common, cross-cutting business processes and activities and information flows.  Activities specific to an individual agency are not included in the FHA, but in that agency’s EA. 
 
Once this top-level target business architecture is established and validated, individual department/agency architectures will be able to map their individual architectures to the common FHA business architecture, and, over time, migrate their own architectures to improve their use of terminology adopted by the FHA if a business need exists. Architecture must be flexible to allow for each agency's unique mission functions and requirements to be identified and supported.",yes,no,no,n/a,67.026,8.072,8.072,8.072,2004,2018,"In FY15, DoD reduced their FHA funding contribution by $300K, but this is offset by an in-kind contribution of $300K to provide additional DoD staffing support for FHA, and DoD increased their funding contribution by an additional $562K to provide funding for CONNECT Gateway development..","HHS Interim Acquisition Guidance Concerning Earned Value Management, dated October 1, 2008, does not require EVM for any contract less than $10M or for any firm-fixed price, time & materials,  labor hour, or term contract less than $25M.

The investment maintains familiar and essential IT tools that enable ORA to adapt to new requirements from legislation and growing business needs.

GOALS - SIRCE supports FDA Strategic Goal 1: Enhance Oversight of FDA-Regulated Products Objective 1.2: Reduce risks in the manufacturing, production and distribution of FDA-regulated products; Objective 1.3: Strengthening detection and surveillance of problems with FDA-regulated product; Objective 1.4: Improve Response to identified and emerging problems with FDA-regulated products; Goal 4: Strengthen Organizational Excellence and Accountability Objective 4.2: Improve the overall operation and effectiveness of FDA. 
Near-term goals focus on maintaining and enhancing existing systems and adding new tools to support mission achievement. Existing systems have long been essential to ORA’s enforcement of regulations related to imported and domestic products and to sharing food and drug product information with other health safety organizations. Planned new functions enhance existing systems for risk-based decision making; remote access for facility inspections; and data sharing with Federal, state and local agencies.

CURRENT/ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: SIRCE enables ORA to effectively increase public health and improve workforce productivity. SIRCE benefits the public by enabling risk-based inspections and import screens that ensure medical product safety and the farm-to-table safety of the food supply. SIRCE expanding ability to share data with other public health organizations improves the nation’s ability to detect, identify, and respond to health emergencies. SIRCE’s internalbenefits include improved user interface, data management, and communication systems that increase productivity and enable ORA staff to spend more time on their important public safety duties.

KEY CUSTOMERS/STAKEHOLDERS: Approximately 6,600 people in nearly all FDA business units and over 600 state users benefit from the SIRCE systems. The business community and, ultimately, the public, are also key stakeholders benefiting from efficient FDA processes and reduced public health risk.",000-000,"368 - Reduce foodborne illness in the population., 679 - Advance the regulatory sciences to enhance food safety, improve medical product development, and support tobacco regulation","Internal Benefits:
Improved efficiency of work by using electronic evidence, digital signatures, and rules engines for Field Operations (Inspections, Investigations, Field Exams, Sample Collections).  Includes online and offline work and automatic synchronization.  This will result in an average of about 30% reduction in time for field operations.  ORA currently spends about 1,450,000 hours per annum on field operations, so SIRCE is projected to free up about 435,000 hours.  However, this will not result in a cost decrease for ORA as the work load for ORA is increasing (in part due to FSMA requirements).  But it will lead to more field operations and improvements in protecting the public health.
External Benefits of using the SIRCE systems results in a reduction in mortality and morbidity in the US public by:. 
1) Pre-Market Inspections: ORA inspects firms applying for drug, device, biologics, and food approvals.
2) Post-Market Surveillance: Most of the ORA work monitors firms, processes used, and products produced to maintain and improve quality and prevent harm to the public.
3) Emergency Response: ORA responds to public health emergencies when a dangerous product is being used or may be used by the US public.
The benefit is based on how many negative incidents are prevented by MARCS.  According to the CDC, 48,000,000 Americans get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from food-borne diseases each year.  MARCS also handles drugs, devices, biologics, and tobacco in addition to food and feed.  The cantaloupe listeria incident in 2011 resulted in 33 deaths and 147 illnesses.  Utilizing a mean Value of a Statistical Life of $5.5M, prevention of just one cantaloupe listeria incident (33 deaths) gives a benefit of $181.5M.  This only counts mortality and not morbidity.  It also includes only one commodity and one incident.  Thus, a benefit estimate of $181.5M is quite conservative.

Transparency in the collection and use of user fees is the foundation of continued cooperation with Industry.
 Goals: UFFRS goals are to facilitate effective management of the funding provided through user fees and appropriations and to provide in-depth financial information to both internal and external stakeholders.
Objectives: UFFRS objectives include collection of User Fees as required by Congress and management and reporting FDA’s budget. UFFRS comprises two components: 1)The User Fee System (UFS) supports effective management of the 12 User Fee Programs through automated billing, collection and reporting of user fees as mandated by Congress. 2) The Financial Reporting System (FRS) supports effective management and reporting of FDA funds: both user fees and appropriations.  It supports FDA’s budget formulation and execution processes, including the control and distribution of funds.
Current and Anticipated Benefits: UFS currently collects almost $2 Billion annually from User Fees, over 40 % of FDA’s annual budget. It enables users to calculate and pay fees online and provides related services such as aging of accounts and tracking the status of the collections.

The User Fee System (UFS) enables FDA to meet Congressional requirements for collection and reporting.  Benefits include efficiency and transparency in fee collecting and recording.  UFS generates over 4,000 invoices and collects about 37,000 payments. Its external interface enables industry to submit fees and view the submission status. Customer feedback is positive.  Interfaces with HHS’ UFMS and related systems ensure that fees are reported accurately.  Annual ROI using a traditional formula (gain - cost)/cost returns an ROI of 50000%.

UFS has been in operation for a decade. It is largely steady state, with regular competitive awards for O&M support and enhancements.  Enhancements are incorporated as needed to address additional Fees resulting from Congressional Acts. Upgrades are done to retain technical currency.   Options for alternatives to UFS’ highly customized services are not currently under consideration.  Major reengineering of UFS’ highly customized features would far exceed the cost of maintaining the current system.

The benefits for this investment are considerable. The most significant impact is identified to be a reduction in network infrastructure costs. 
The move to a chassis virtual switch architecture and reducing the number of physical devices in the datacenter has reduced the  amount of rack space, power and cooling needed for network equipment and will ultimately reduce the network equipment footprint in the datacenter. FDA has implemented network monitoring solutions that will free network managers to work on more strategic projects. The implementation of network monitoring and analysis tools has improved problem resolution and root cause analysis of performance issues, which  results in a reduction of technician labor hours and provide greater system uptime.  FDA will be able to reduce contractor headcount required to manage and maintain its network and redeploy staff to more strategic and productive tasks.
Improved end-user productivity will also be a major benefit of this investment. In support of the FDA Hoteling initiative the implementation of new technologies such as VoIP, the Unified Communication Suite, wireless networking, and secure VPN remote access has facilitated the ability for FDA employees to easily telecommute and office share.  This supports the reduction in dedicated office space needs which leads to reduced leasing cost.   The implementation of VoIP has also significantly reduced FDA's line cost.
FDA will also see a reduction in cost of high speed data circuits through the use of WAN Optimization as an alternative to high cost, high bandwidth circuits.  Through WAN optimization FDA has been able to achieve much higher throughput over lower bandwidth circuits.  This will reduce the need for excessive monthly circuit charges. Increased network throughput results in an increase in end-user productivity.

This replacement alone is reducing time (design and development) and effort (cost of implementation) to keep systems updated to changing business requirements and mandates. It is expanding to accommodate the expected increases in New Drug and Generic Drug Approval volume, plus reduce Generic Drug approval backlog. System replacement is improving background IT utilization, by reducing the number of operating systems, software and hardware licenses and manpower required versus the multiple compartmentalized “stove pipe” tailored systems currently in use. Upgrades will be support by COTS vendors and supporting contractors working throughout the industry with these tools. 
Standardizing the data, workflow and data marketplace tools is improving efficiency of processes, reducing process redundancy, and lowering training costs versus the multiple systems used prior to RRP. Risk is greatly reduced as a scalable system is in place to carry the weight of increased workload and new requirements for quicker turnaround (PDUFA, GDUFA and BsUFA). Security is requiring less manpower to manage with a lower number of software and hardware systems to monitor. 
Direct benefit will continue to improve process efficiency reducing the time to approval of regulated drugs, allowing more drugs to be approved annually in a growing drug approval pipeline.

NPDB collects data on medical malpractice payments, license/clinical privilege suspensions, and other adverse actions taken against physicians, nurses, dentists, and other health care practitioners. NPDB also collects data on civil judgments, criminal convictions, and exclusions from health plans against health care providers and suppliers. NPDB discloses this information to specific entities using role-based authorization, limiting access only to eligible users in accordance with legislative authority.

NPDB was initiated because Congress found: (1) Increasing occurrence of medical malpractice and the need to improve medical care quality warrant greater efforts than states can provide; (2) National need to restrict incompetent physicians from moving across state lines without disclosure or discovery of the physician's previous damaging or incompetent performance; (3) Lack of effective professional peer review; and (4) National need to provide incentive protection for physicians engaging in professional peer review. 

NPDB was mandated by the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. NPDB’s authorities were enhanced by the Medicare and Medicaid Patient Program Protection Act of 1987, HIPAA of 1996, and the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

NPDB maintains over 1,100,000 reports. On average, users submit 50,000 new reports each year. Users perform over 4,700,000 queries each year against these reports. In the past 3 years, queries by hospitals, state boards, and other entities have disclosed over 391,000 reports that have informed decisions on hiring, licensing, and credentialing. These statistics demonstrate how NPDB directly contributes towards the HHS goal of ensuring patient safety.

NPDB also allows individual practitioners to self-query their own Data Bank record and submit a statement and/or place a report in dispute if they disagree with the information reported to the Data Bank. NPDB provides over 80,000 self-queries annually.

NPDB is a self-sustaining, fee-for-service program operated by HRSA that does not require Congressional appropriations.


FY16 improvements include streamlining the workflow and usability; system security and data integrity; enhanced compliance efforts for community health centers, hospitals, and health plans using Agile methodology for project releases.",009-014,"670 - Improve healthcare quality and patient safety","Though possible to operate the NPDB program manually without an IT system, it would be cost-prohibitive. An in-sourced paper-based manual processing solution would require hiring 605 FTEs & renting additional office space for an annual cost of $92 million. The hypothetical total is $66 million more than the total program costs of the currently chosen alternative.

Using these estimates, the ROI of the currently chosen alternative (IT solution with contractors) is 240% when compared to an in-sourced manual paper processing method.

Recent system enhancements with high ROI have significantly reduced user administrative burden:
-Express self-query allows 80,000 users each year to get their self-query output online instantly, rather than wait 2 weeks for the manual paper process.
-Streamlining the Dispute resolution process has resulted in faster close-out of disputed practitioner reports.
-Streamlining the workflow for agents has allowed high-volume multi-campus hospitals & composite state licensing boards to process multiple transactions simultaneously without having to log in/out each time.
-Improving the Compliance Tracker has enabled HRSA to more effectively track compliance of state board reporting.
-Merger of HIPDB & NPDB eliminated a significant redundancy, reduced costs, & cut data entry burden by 50% for most hospitals & state boards.
-Paperless registration renewal eliminated a paper process for 94% of entities (over 100,000 pages of paper saved annually), & improved security of the entity registration process. The NPDB program won a “HHS Green Champion” award for this accomplishment.
-Launched initial on-line data analysis tool, graphs, & maps to make summary NPDB data more accessible to the public. BI dashboards are being planned to make these tools more interactive & dynamic.
-Retired the legacy ITP interface & converted all batch users to XML to eliminate a redundant system module, improve data integrity, & reduce operational costs.
-Implemented a geocoding/address validation interface to improve data quality. The enhancement reduced the volume of undeliverable mail by 60%.

The purpose of the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) is to provide a national picture of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with our national, state, and local public health partners and to support the use of syndromic surveillance in order to detect and characterize disease outbreaks or other hazardous events or conditions of public health concern. 
BioSense mission is to:
Advance the science and practice of syndromic surveillance, strengthen effective governance for decision-making, develop and maintain the platform to host and provide access to syndromic surveillance applications including BioSense, analytic tools and services; and develop and maintain the BioSense application for data collection, processing, and sharing. 
 
Our goals include:
 
1.       Enhancement of current software functionality
2.       Provide additional analytic tools in the cloud
3.       Improve data quality and representativeness
Achieving these 3 goals will increase usefulness to our partners in state and local public health departments.  Additionally by providing this platform and suite of tools, we help state and local health departments assist their hospitals in achieving the Syndromic Surveillance Meaningful Use objective.  The more our state and local partners use and find value in the tools we provide, the more data and information will flow into the shared environment and the more complete our national surveillance picture will be.  A more complete surveillance picture will translate into earlier recognition of, better characterization of, and more effective response to events of public health significance.
BioSense and the NSSP are part of the CDC surveillance strategy.  Supporting and accomplishing this work will directly affect achievement of the newly described strategy.  Our key stakeholders include CDC leadership, CDC programs, State Health Departments, City and County Health Departments, and local hospitals.  Providing access to shared analytic tools and services for public health programs and practioners will allow analysis and sharing of disease patterns when needed to identify, investigate, and monitor public health threats that cross municipal jurisdictions.",009-031,"675 - Improve health care and population health through meaningful use of health information technology","The key aim of BioSense is to provide federal, state, and local public health officials with the data, information, and tools they need to better prepare for and coordinate public health responses, and safeguard and improve the health of the American people.  BioSense contributes to a nationwide and regional (i.e., multi-state) situational awareness for all hazards health-related events (beyond bioterrorism).   The BioSense Program is improving its utility for state and local users, and thereby integrating local and state-level data into a cohesive “picture” for the nation.  This is consistent with the 2006 Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), and 2007 Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-21), both of which call for regional and nationwide public health situational awareness, through enabling state and local situational awareness capability.  Although the original goal of syndromic surveillance was rapid outbreak detection, most public health professionals now find this surveillance approach to provide considerable value for situational awareness, or monitoring and projecting changes in population health.  
   
Successful implementation of BioSense promotes a national situational awareness picture that provides the following outcomes:  
 
•          Greater partner communication and collaboration  
•          Greater data sharing  
•          Greater access to more comprehensive information (regional/national views)

It also establishes required policy-level agreements on data collection, dissemination, and access in accordance with local, state and federal regulations to ensure protection of the community's confidentiality and represents ongoing collaboration between CDC and its public health partners.

In 2001, no state had integrated public health surveillance systems; today over 50 jurisdictions have implemented based on NEDSS vision. Standards based leadership have resulted in an array of systems and supporting technologies such as Public Health Information Network (PHIN), NEDSS Base System (NBS), Messaging Subscription Service (MSS), and Message Validation Processing and Provisioning System (MVPS). With the evolution of technology, data and exchange standards, CDC now has the opportunity to strengthen and modernize its infrastructure. As part of the CDC Surveillance Strategy, NNDSS Modernization Initiative (NMI) is underway to enhance the system's ability to provide more comprehensive, timely, and higher quality data than ever before for public health decision making. The realization of the investment is best illustrated by improved processes, systems, and infrastructure enabling nation's public health authorities to identify, monitor, and investigate diseases of public health importance. NMI has 3 key components: 1) development of standards-based messages for submission of nationally notifiable disease data sent by health jurisdictions to CDC;2) development of software to validate, process and provision the data to CDC programs; 3) technical assistance for health jurisdictions implementing the messages. This multi-year initiative, will increase robustness of technology infrastructure so that it is based on interoperable, standardized data and exchange mechanisms.

The critical priorities established for the Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Winnable Battle include timely progress on national HAI surveillance and more specifically further expansion of NHSN and acceleration of electronic reporting from healthcare facilities to the CDC surveillance system.

Healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance are major problems in US healthcare institutions. In hospitals alone, nearly 2 million patients acquire infections that contribute to more than 88,000 deaths and cost more than $4.5 billion annually. Healthcare personnel are also at risk of acquiring infections while performing their duties. Over 16,000 healthcare facilities are enrolled in NHSN.

Development of new modules and components add new capabilities for tracking HAIs of concern and process measures for patient quality of care. All of these revisions contribute to improving the data that are analyzed and used to accurately assess the level of seriousness of HAIs throughout the nation and the impact of prevention efforts implemented to control and diminish patient risk.

The NHSN relationship with The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) continues to expand and grow stronger.  CMS rules for reporting requirements now reach well beyond acute care hospitals to include a variety of post-acute care facility types, as well as outpatient facility services.  With this continued uptake, the NHSN data more strongly represent the true picture of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in the nation.

All of CMS’ core program dollars are accounted for in HIGLAS.  Payment dollars are comprised of all CMS lines of business which include the Health Insurance Marketplace payments beginning January 2014.  The FY 2014 program dollars processed through HIGLAS exceeded $800 billion.  HIGLAS continues to enhance CMS’ oversight of all financial operations, in order to achieve accurate, reliable, and timely financial accounting and reporting for all of CMS’ programs and activities.
 
HIGLAS is a national standardized financial program that began operation in 2005.  It reduced over 50 separate accounting/payment systems for Medicare and Medicaid into one system.  The main objective of this effort was to leverage the use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) software in the federal government to increase automation, increase efficiency, and maximize economies of effort to centralize management and save millions of taxpayer dollars that fund Medicare and Medicaid each year, while at the same time eliminating redundant and inefficient / ineffective manual processes.",000-000,"689 - Enhance access to and use of data to improve HHS programs and support improvements in the health and well-being of the American people","HIGLAS implementation yields significant improvements and benefits to the Nation’s Medicare program which strengthens the Federal government’s fiscal management and program operations/management of the Medicare program.  HIGLAS provides the capability for CMS and HHS to achieve compliance with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) of 1996.  HIGLAS is a critical success factor in ensuring HHS meets FFMIA compliance requirements.  FFMIA requires each Federal agency to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply with federal requirements and accounting standards.  Through the implementation of HIGLAS at the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) and the implementation of administrative program accounting functions at CMS central office, 100% of CMS core program dollars are accounted for in HIGLAS.  In addition, HIGLAS is paramount towards the ability of HHS to retain a “clean” audit opinion as required by the Chief Financial Officer’s (CFO) Act.  The HIGLAS effort has improved significantly the ability of CMS/HHS to perform Medicare accounting transactions.  These improvements and benefits attributable to HIGLAS include reduced costs due to elimination of redundant individual Medicare financial record systems, improvements in automated Medicare debt collection/referral activities, creation of audit trails for every Medicare transaction/payment/claim in HIGLAS, improved Medicare financial audit ability, and improved capability for CMS to more systematically and efficiently recover identified Medicare overpayments.  Moreover, HIGLAS implementation has resulted in better internal financial controls across Medicare contractor operations.  Implementation of HIGLAS has a significant and positive impact on the amount of additional interest earned (saved) in the Medicare Trust Funds.  Internal CMS analysis has shown that Medicare contractors transitioned to HIGLAS are collecting monies quicker than in a pre-HIGLAS environment.  This is a direct result of efficiencies gained in the process of offsetting or “netting” receivables that are owed by Medicare providers to the government.  HIGLAS also supports the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) operated by Treasury by offsetting payments.

In order to achieve a robust and enduring technical solution to all the appeals processing needs, the Medicare Appeals System (MAS) was awarded to a contractor in September 2003. The MAS design supports a unified case tracking system that facilitates maintenance and transfer of case specific data with regard to fee-for-service and managed care appeals throughout the four levels of the appeals process, i.e., Level 1 appeals: affiliated contractors, Level 2 appeals: QICs, Level 3 appeals: ALJs, and Level 4 appeals: the DAB. In developing the MAS, HHS and SSA worked together to capitalize on SSA’s knowledge and experience in developing the case processing management system (CPMS) and avoid unnecessary duplication. 

In addition to basic case tracking across all levels of Medicare appeals in a unified system, the MAS provides the capability to report on appeals data, enable more accurate and expedient responses to Congressional questions, and provide more precise data for assessment and policy-setting. MAS fulfills these business needs by focusing on data collection, data analysis, and workflow management. The MAS is capable of docketing/calendaring hearings, scheduling expert witnesses for testimony, and providing information on the Medicare appeals workload as it relates to the number of ALJs and support staff required to process appeals. Moreover, the MAS envisions a future environment in which all of the management of the appeal files will be handled electronically.

HPMS manages the plan enrollment and compliance business processes for all private health and drug plans participating in the MA and Part D programs, including, but not limited to, application, bid, formulary submissions, marketing material reviews, plan oversight, complaints tracking, operational data feeds for enrollment and payment, and data support for the Medicare & You handbook and Medicare Plan Finder. As the central e-government system for managing the day-to-day operations of these programs, HPMS ensures that there is a single mechanism by which plans and CMS can communicate electronically in a secure and efficient manner. HPMS is critical to CMS in managing nearly 800 MA and PDP organizations to ensure that they are fulfilling their statutory, regulatory, and administrative requirements. The HPMS investment aligns with the four primary CMS strategic goals and related objectives. In support of the “Better Care and Lower Costs” goal and “Improve Quality of Care” objective, HPMS serves as the system of record for collecting data on physicians employed by MA plans who are meaningfully using certified electronic health record (EHR) technology, thereby contributing to greater efficiencies, improved healthcare, and lower costs. The “Prevention and Population Health” goal and “Improve Preventive Health Benefits” objective are supported by means of the annual plan bidding process. By design, HPMS requires MA organizations to offer all preventive services that are available under Original Medicare at no cost to their MA plan members at no cost as well. The HPMS investment also supports the “Expanded Health Care Coverage” goal and “Expand Coverage” objective. HPMS is providing system support to new agency programs designed to expand health care options to Medicare beneficiaries: Shared Savings Program (SSP) Accountable Care Organizations (ACO), Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMP) through the Capitated Financial Alignment Initiative, and the CMS Innovation Center Models. Lastly, HPMS supports the agency’s “Enterprise Excellence” strategic goal. HPMS contributes to this strategic goal through its automation of provider and pharmacy network reviews, restructuring of the plan audit functionality, and expansion of electronic signature functionality.",009-078,"675 - Improve health care and population health through meaningful use of health information technology","HPMS generates a high level of return on investment (ROI), as it automates MA and Part D business processes that would otherwise be performed manually.  Significant benefits are gained both internally by the federal government and externally by plan organizations. Two examples of processes automated in HPMS that have generated a high ROI are described below. 
  
CMS has fully automated the MA and Part D application submission and review process in HPMS. Previously, this process involved the mailing of large binders to CMS and a manual review across the agency’s ten regional offices. Under the automated process, organizations submit their applications and corresponding provider and pharmacy networks via HPMS. Systematic checks ensure that all sections of the application are completed and that all network uploads follow the appropriate record layouts. The system then evaluates the application attestation and network submissions against standardized criteria and records review results. By automating the application submission and attestation and network review processes, CMS has transformed a time-intensive, manual, and subjective process into one that is streamlined, standardized, and accurate. 
 
HPMS automation of the bid submission process also generates a high level of ROI. The Plan Benefit Package (PBP) and Bid Pricing Tool (BPT) capture the MA and Part D benefit offerings and pricing of those benefits. Plans upload these tools into HPMS, and the system validates and then unloads the data so that CMS can complete the review and approval of the submitted bids for over 5,000 plans. Edit checks have been added to both tools to ensure minimum standards have been met (e.g., maximum cost-sharing for certain benefits), reducing the time necessary for review. The PBP software also produces the Summary of Benefits, which is used for standardized marketing material as well as displays on the Medicare.gov website.  This process allows organizations to submit benefit packages in an automated way and use these data for other internal systems. Organizations also can copy data from year-to-year, reducing data entry errors and data entry time.  CMS must perform bid and benefit reviews in an extremely compressed timeframe, which could not be accomplished without this automated process.",yes,no,yes,n/a,133.873,22.813,22.621,23.079,1999,2030,"This investment has gone through the CPIC process.

This project, for the first time, will provide streamlined, centralized access and analysis for standardized Medicaid data across multiple states, integrated with data from Medicare Parts A, B, and D. The availability of a centralized source for accessing the tremendous volume of data on claims, providers, and beneficiaries will enable consistent, reliable, and timely analyses, improving the ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse in both programs. 

One PI supports the HHS strategic initiatives, addresses legislative requirements, and will provide support to three systems in OMB’s PART program: Medicare, Medicaid, and Health Care Fraud.  The system will allow for the efficient expansion of the agency’s Medi-Medi data match project as required in the DRA of 2005. Centralizing Medicare and Medicaid data in this one system will create efficiencies for many of CMS’s offices and their contractors along with different law enforcement agencies.  The effort supports provisions in the BIPA of 2000 and the Part D program components of the MMA of 2003. The program will meet a key functional goal of the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by providing increased tools to combat fraud, waste and abuse.  

There is a dependency between the One-PI and the Integrated Data Repository (IDR) investment.

There are many shortfalls of the existing data mining systems such as lack of standardization.  The contractor(s) and law enforcement's capabilities vary widely in terms of analytic capacity, data processing approach, and even the CMS data that is available to them.  Another shortfall is within the tools being used to access the data.  The contractor(s) and law enforcement's current process lacks the means for easy cooperation and sharing; utilizes various analysis tools resulting in inconsistent outcomes; has different sources of data; and uses multiple and varied analysis processes resulting in inconsistent outcomes.  Finally, there was a lack of, or disparity in, measurable success criteria.
The One PI System is designed to modernize CMS' approach to combating fraud, waste and abuse and address each of the challenges. The use of integrated data across all Medicare programs provide a comprehensive picture of claims, providers and beneficiaries.  The new data model, developed by One PI in partnership with the IDR, also supports the integration of Medicaid data.  Data on episodes of care and episodes of admission can be used to see variations in treatment and cost across the nation or in particular areas or for specific providers.  The new tools available to all users, allow standardized reports or complex queries to be made available to all contractors.  The reduction in time running routine reports and queries will allow analysts to concentrate on innovative approaches to investigating fraud, waste and abuse.  One PI also provides a collaboration capability that will allow analysts to share methodologies and to build on each other's work.

The current Risk Adjustment Processing System collects only 5 data elements for risk adjustment.  Since CMS does not collect MAO enrollees’ expenditure data, it has been establishing risk coefficients based on Original Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims diagnosis and cost data.  Thus, coefficients used for payment are not the same as those that would be calculated if CMS used MAO-based diagnosis and cost data.  MAO's do not report diagnoses (and perhaps cost) in the same patterns as FFS providers, thus risk scores are overstated and MOA's are overpaid. Without data on the full range of services MAO enrollees receive, CMS is limited in its ability to review the MA program annual contracting bids and conduct comparative effectiveness research.  The FY 2009 rule (73 FR 48650) reasserted CMS’ authority to collect data from MAO's.  Based on this ruling, CMS requires MAO's to submit encounter data for dates of service January 3, 2012 and later. This date is consistent with the current industry movement towards standardization of data collection formats, common edit modules, transition to ICD-10 diagnosis and HIPAA compliance measures. This investment has developed and implemented a new Encounter Data System (EDS) to collect MAO beneficiary per-visit health care encounter data using the HIPAA 5010 version of the X12 standards; which edits, prices and stores the data.  The EDS will enable calculation of new risk coefficients that will more accurately reflect the demographics, patterns of care, and the predicted costs of diseases for MAO enrollees. This will result in more accurate risk adjustment data to provide to the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx) for monthly payment calculation for payments to MAO's. The inclusion of encounter data as part of the risk score calculation is targeted for the 2015 payment year. The EDS data will also enable analysis of health care utilization and will enable service utilization and quality comparisons across the original Medicare and MA programs.

Profiles and relationships that provide the relationship between an entity and an organization and provides the profiles of the entity. 
Data services that provide business applications access to integrated MDM profile data and relationships.
Business intelligence service that provides a separate mechanism to support analytical applications and report generation.
The primary goals of MDM are:
·         Resolve identity ambiguity inherent in CMS Beneficiary and Provider data through an identity resolution service
·         Better manage, organize and store all CMS Beneficiary, Provider, Organization, and Program profile data components

In FY14, FPLS helped collect over $28.2B in child support, including $3.8B in federal collections. From FY10 to FY14, FPLS-attributable collections increased by 12.3%, despite extremely difficult economic times. Next to the custodial parents’ earnings, child support is the 2nd largest income source for poor families receiving child support. Because of its nationwide breadth & scope, & the nature of the child support program, it is characterized by a unique, comprehensive, partnership of federal, state & local government agencies, thousands of employers, & millions of citizens. Technology, in the form of the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS), has been key to the success of the child support program. 

The FPLS assists states in effectively & efficiently achieving the ultimate mission of the program – providing child support to millions of our nation’s children.

OMHA was created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 to simplify the appeals process and make it more efficient. OMHA’s current workload has increased dramatically over the last year and has significantly impacted its ability to effectively process the work.  OMHA’s claims received increased by 196% from 2006 to 2012.  This large increase in workload has resulted in a large backlog of appeals that has overwhelmed OMHA’s paper case file storage facilities and decreased the percent of appeals processed in the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) 90 day timeframe.  OMHA must take advantage of the efficiencies that electronic processing can bring.  To accomplish this, OMHA has initiated the Electronic Case Adjudication and Processing Environment (ECAPE) project.

As the IBC's customer base continues to grow with new clients or current clients adding services, IBC saves millions of dollars for both DOI and IBC's non-Interior clients by providing cost avoidance and/or cost savings through economies of scale. For FY16, the W-2 rate will remain at $196 per W-2 (no cost increase from FY15; less than the charge for FY13 and14 and less than the rate charged in 1997!)  As the rate was $197 per W-2 in 1997, the costs are actually more than 35% lower today, adjusted for inflation. Instead of keeping up with the CPI, the rate is saving the clients over $29M annually. Since 2010, the functionality of the system has increased more than 50%.  In addition, IBC offers discount pricing on licensing for Talent Acquisition which has saved customers $28.98M since FY09.

IMARS provides a common capability across all participating functional areas for capturing and reporting law enforcement and security incident information and has been configured, tested, and was deployed to over 3,000 users in FY12. IMARS has been deployed across five agencies and locations to address three principle threats:
   National Security - Law enforcement officers (LEOs) and agents working in seven law enforcement programs distributed between five bureaus nationwide lacked the tools to perform various law enforcement activities (information sharing and intelligence analysis of terrorism, drug cartels, etc.) which take place in the nations 1,672 sites and to protect 489 million visitors annually.  Because DOI has so many law enforcement responsibilities at so many sites across the country, it is continually collecting information on people and events.  Both actions and observations, criminal and non-criminal, may have security implications, and these need to be recorded, reported, shared and analyzed on multiple levels.
   Public Safety - DOI, the nation's largest land-owner, has day-to-day law enforcement responsibilities on 500 million acres of lands that it owns and manages.  DOI has the responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate criminal activity that occurs on its lands.  DOI must manage safety and protection for the millions of visitors each year that use these lands, as well as for the thousands of DOI employees that manage the resources, including monitor visitor use, manage crowds/traffic, and protect historical, natural and cultural resources.  These responsibilities require the collection, analysis, management and reporting of information.
   Officer Safety - DOI and Tribal LEOs, including corrections and investigations (approx. 6,500 total users), are at a far greater risk due to a lack of information sharing on warrants and suspected individuals. IMARS access will allow officers (including tribal law enforcement), agents, and dispatchers to access departmental and national databases from their immediate locations, thus significantly enhancing officer safety in the field.

In pursuing this goal, Interior is following the information technology investment management practices and principles identified in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002.

Interior's goal is to continue improvements in business transaction processing, analysis, and reporting and to enhance business management systems support. Interior relies on business management systems planned for, managed together, and operated collectively to support program, business and financial managers.

Prior to FBMS the Department's business management systems architecture included redundant systems managed at the bureau level, some managed at the departmental level, and some that are government-wide systems on which the Department relies. FBMS established a single, integrated business management system architecture of four interrelated elements that drive business process improvements, and financial integrity. These are:
(1) improvement of internal controls;
(2) elimination of redundant data entry;
(3) enabling end-to-end transaction processing; and
(4) standardization of data for improved information quality and transparency.

In early FY 2014 Interior completed the migration of its bureaus onto FBMS. This important milestone positioned the Department to finally achieve the following goals across all of its bureaus:
- Standardized and integrated processes;
- Improved security and internal controls;
- Improved cost information;
- Improved tracking and auditing capabilities;
- Reduced data entry in multiple systems and manual paper processing;
- Improved Department-wide and bureau- specific reporting capabilities;
- Increased data integrity; and
- Retirement of aging and unsupported legacy systems.

Now that the solution is fully deployed across Interior, the Department is focused on improvements to the system to address customer service gaps and improve usability.

As a result, the Department is positioned to deliver programs and services in a more efficient and effective manner, with greatly improved internal controls.  Benefits gained from implementing FBMS include:

- Enhanced access to, and sharing of, real-time business information that supports effective business decisions for mission delivery at all levels in the organization in the Department, the bureaus and in the field. 
- More timely financial reports that facilitate analysis of financial, acquisition, financial assistance, and property data. For example, the Department used FBMS to automate reporting on Hurricane Sandy response and recovery. In the legacy environment, manual data calls and consolidation would have been necessary.
- Retirement of outdated and legacy systems that do not comply with current mandates and are no longer supported by their software vendors. FBMS enabled the decommissioning of 83 legacy systems.
- Increased data integrity and transparency, and increased process and data standardization among the bureaus.
- An improved internal control environment with separation of duties as well as refined and standardized business practices to support the internal controls, especially through the creation of automated controls.
- Support for the consolidated audit with centrally produced information that can be used by the Department, the OIG, and the independent auditor. This represents a significantly simpler financial audit that had been possible prior to FBMS.  Throughout the sequence of FBMS deployments, Interior has maintained its unqualified audit opinions.
- Shared expertise as the Department and the bureaus are able to consistently train personnel who can be leveraged across bureaus.    

The implementation of FBMS has enabled DOI to realize the benefits of a fully integrated, secure, modernized, system, and also strengthen communication and collaboration across the business management community. FBMS has proven effective as a means to integrate the siloed business management policy communities.

For hardware and software contracts EVM is not required. For O&amp;M contracts EVM is not performed.

The Business Integration Office (BIO) maintains numerous projects throughout the year.  These projects are chartered with specific scope, and managed using a project methodology that best meets the project s requirements.  Most projects are modular enhancement projects used for optimizing the current system functionality or incremental large scale improvements.  

Sound project management principles are utilized to define scope as a project, and to assign the project methodology and practices within that project.    These principles include an assessment of performance reporting need.  Each project is evaluated on a case by case basis to determine if there are benefits to instituting EVM as a performance reporting mechanism.  
Several factors are considered in making the EVM reporting determination:
 	Does the project utilize a contract that has provisions for providing EVM?
 	Does the project utilize a complex project plan that spans multiple years?  (Note that the current BIO strategic roadmap advocates that projects be responsive through modular, agile methodologies.  There are no complex, multi-year projects anticipated in the near future.)
 	Does the project have significant, unmitigated risk to the program?
 	Does the value provided by the EVM data exceed the cost of generating the data? 

In most cases when EVM is required, the EVM reporting will be accomplished using known budget execution data against the performance baseline to identify cost variances via spreadsheet.  Schedule variances will be tracked and reported via the baselined project plan.

The Geospatial Platform is a government-wide shared service that delivers trusted, nationally consistent data and services; authoritative data to support informed decision-making; problem solving applications (services) that are built once and used many times across multiple Federal agencies and other organizations; and a national and federal focal point where governmental, non-governmental, private and public data and applications can be used together to inform and address national and regional issues.

Federal, state, and local government agencies collect, maintain, and use geospatial data linked to specific geographic locations in support of many functions including national security, law enforcement, health care, environmental sustainability, and emergency preparedness and response. These data are purchased or collected and maintained by many agencies independently, and their use by multiple agencies and organizations requires coordination, interoperability, and shared services and applications. The Geospatial Platform investment will provide a mechanism for the sharing of geospatial assets to reduce redundancy; ensure implementation of standards to promote integration and interoperability; establish/document oversight measures to ensure accountability; and facilitate a portfolio management approach to Federal management of National Geospatial Data Assets, fulfilling the requirements and intention of OMB Circular A-16 Supplemental Guidance.

Beneficiaries of this investment include agencies in all levels of government, which experience cost savings and avoidance; non-governmental organizations and the private sector as users of geospatial data, who find data from trusted sources, as well as compatible services, to be more readily available from a single source; and the American public, which will benefit from greater efficiency and accountability in the expenditure of tax dollars.",000-000,"1298 - Generate Geologic Maps","One stop shop to deliver trusted, authoritative, and nationally consistent data and services;

These entities include BLM, USFS, BIA, FWS, NPS, DOI, and The Nature Conservancy. The IQCS system was built for the creation and delivery of the Incident Qualification Card report.  The report is printed and delivered to the Incident Responder for validation of position requirements for the field.   All of the wildland fire incident response personnel dispatched to every incident are required to have the Incident Qualification Card (also known as the  Red Card ), on their person when arriving at the dispatched incident.

The federal, state and local government agencies that have incident response program management responsibility including DOI and all of its member agencies and offices, the USFS (agency of the DOA), and NASF (NWCG member) are all stakeholders in IQCS.  Each of the listed agencies has provided requirements, funding, and personnel to support this program.  

Currently, there are approximately 2800 registered users in many different roles.  The majority of the users are hands-on account managers.  These account managers manage the qualifications records for 67,000+ incident responders.  The next largest groups of users are the training officers.  The smallest group is the Fire Management Officer, FMO.  In an average month, about 50% of the users will login and utilize the application at least one time.

IQCS provides a common web-enabled, single point of access for all entities that use the system.  IQCS supports the Enterprise Architecture.

ANSS provides realtime information on the distribution and intensity of earthquake shaking to emergency responders so that they can rapidly assess the full impact of an earthquake and speed disaster relief to the most heavily affected areas. ANSS also provides engineers with the information they need to improve building design standards and engineering practices to mitigate the impact of earthquakes.

ANSS reduces costs through avoided losses. Average annual earthquake losses in the U.S. are estimated to approach $6 billion per year. Losses are avoided by improved mitigation (a result of more accurate hazard assessments), improved emergency response (a result of more accurate, useful and timely information), and improved awareness and decision-making in both public and private sectors (a result of the availability of accurate, reliable, timely information).

As detailed in a report of the National Academy, strongly supporting the full deployment of ANSS, the beneficiaries are diverse: the public benefits from improved earthquake safety and reduced losses; emergency responders, governments at all levels, and lifeline operators benefit from improved situational awareness following a damaging earthquake; and scientists, engineers and architects benefit from improved data and information about earthquakes and the ground- and structural motions they cause.

The 2013 Science Strategy for the Natural Hazards Mission Area calls for full deployment of the ANSS to improve seismic monitoring of the Nation and the 26 U.S. urban areas at greatest risk from earthquakes.  ANSS is also a top priority of the 4-agency NEHRP (National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program) Strategic Plan and in the Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction Implementation Plan of the NSTC Subcommittee for Disaster Reduction. Its full implementation is a top recommendation of the Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee, which is the FACA advisory committee to the USGS Director for the Earthquake Hazards Program.",010-169,"1294 - Monitor and Assess Natural Hazards Risk and Resilience","In 2003, the USGS commissioned a study by the National Research Council (NRC) on the economic benefits of improved seismic monitoring. USGS asked the NRC to examine how improved monitoring could reduce future losses and to estimate the benefits that could be realized by the full deployment of the ANSS.  Their 2005 report represents the most rigorous effort ever to examine the costs and benefits of earthquake monitoring, and it clearly justifies the full deployment of ANSS.  
* The potential benefits of improved seismic monitoring far exceed the costs annualized building and building related earthquake losses are estimated to be about $5.6B, whereas the annualized cost of enhanced seismic monitoring is about $96M, less than 2% of the estimated losses.
* The annual dollar costs for improved seismic monitoring are in the tens of millions, but the potential dollar benefits are in the hundreds of millions.
* Seismic monitoring provides the key to understanding how the built environment responds to significant earthquakes, and improved records offer the potential for fine-tuning the design process so that seismic safety requirements are adequately--but not excessively met.
* Earthquake mitigation actions based on improved seismic information and the resulting reduction in uncertainty- would yield benefits many times the cost of seismic monitoring.
* In just one benefit area, performance-based engineering, dollar estimates for benefits are estimated at $142 million annually  about three times the cost of operating the full ANSS.
* In the area of loss estimation modeling, improved monitoring information will greatly reduce uncertainty, potentially decreasing the cost of insurance and reinsurance, and shifting costs from disaster relief payments and grants (publicly financed) to insurance recoveries (financed through premiums).
* Improved seismic monitoring can significantly increase the accuracy of tsunami warnings and reduce the risk of missed warnings or costly false alarms, which constitute 75% of the warnings issued since 1948.
* The U.S. should rank seismic risk reduction as highly as other critical national programs, should track the growth of risk nationally, and should make the necessary long-term investments to reduce it.

Changes in acquisition patterns, including the increase in the number of scenes acquired and the decreasing amount of money spent after the imagery became available at no cost, point toward increases in future use. The value of Landsat imagery to these users was demonstrated by the high importance placed on the imagery, the numerous benefits observed from projects using Landsat imagery, the impacts if Landsat imagery was no longer available, and the substantial aggregated annual economic benefit from the imagery.

TAAMS is the only system to date that has been able to meet the government's key fractionalization requirement...capable of algorithms dividing ownership to 43 places to the right of the decimal. TAAMS supports the management of trust title ownership, encumbrance, and land records through a centralized bureau-wide system. TAAMS also supports Trust Reform goals identified by DOI and BIA in the Cobell vs. Salazar case, as well as multiple strategic goals, including &quot;honoring trust responsibilities to Indian Tribes.&quot; A performance gap existed before fielding TAAMS. The Land Title and Records Offices (LTROs) could not record title documents, e.g., deeds, leases, probates received from agencies/field offices with the speed required to certify and issue Title Status Reports (TSRs) for agencies to successfully complete trust asset transactions. Before TAAMS, the agency offices manually created and mailed title documents to LTROs, who manually recorded, microfilmed, and entered data into the title system to maintain title documents and chain-of-title to produce TSRs and manually validate its accuracy. The agency and LTRO processes were so time- and labor-intensive that significant backlogs existed for document recording, data entry, and issuance of certified TSRs and probate inventories. TAAMS significantly reduces the amount of time needed to process documents at the agency and LTROs. In TAAMS, title documents are created and entered at the agency and electronically delivered to LTROs via the TAAMS Image Repository where the document is recorded and processed into the land title, and then returned to the agency via the repository. TAAMS closes the gap between manual and automated delivery and processing of title documents and certified land title products and reports. TAAMS expedites the processing of title ownership and the delivery of title documents and certified reports in minutes and hours instead of days and weeks.

The Secretary of Interior established the Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA) in July 2001. OHTA's mission is to perform the historical accounting of IIM accounts and verify their accuracy. Since its inception in 2001, OHTA's scope has expanded to include Tribal accountings, related to the approximately 100 active lawsuits filed by Tribes against Interior. OHTA provides litigation support to Interior, participates in settlement negotiations with tribes, and performs a historical accounting where necessary to support Court actions or settlement. To assist historical accounting efforts, OHTA developed a common Accounting Reconciliation Tool (ART). ART provides a standard and repeatable process for accountants to query transactions from legacy systems, link transactions to relevant source documents, and reconcile transactions and note discrepancies. In addition, the ART includes functionality that assists OHTA in performing quality control and monitoring of reconciliation activities. Data from ART is used to prepare the Historical Statements of Account, which fulfills Interior's requirement to provide a historical accounting. The Secretary has placed a priority on funding the historical accounting to support Cobell and Tribal lawsuits. OHTA senior management allocates the Office funding and ensures the necessary ART funding is provided. If the ART is not funded and is shut down, then Interior cannot comply with the Court's mandate to provide a historical accounting. This could lead to further court action, such as contempt of court citations, or other consequences for Interior. The ART addresses the &quot;Serving Communities&quot; mission area in Interior's Strategic Plan and allows Interior to achieve the End Outcome Goal to &quot;Fulfill Indian Fiduciary Trust Responsibilities&quot;. Specifically, the ART enables Interior to comply with the Court ordered historical accounting and the Trust Funds Management Reform Act of 1994 (to account for the daily and annual balances of all funds held in trust by the US for the benefit of an Indian Tribe or an Individual, which are deposited or invested pursuant to the Act of June 24, 1938).",010-156,"1272 - Fulfill Fiduciary Trust","The Accounting Reconciliation Tool (ART) helped save the government billions of dollars in potential liabilities during the Cobell v.

Title 18, Section 922 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), defines who is prohibited from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving any firearm or ammunition in or affecting commerce.  The NICS Regulation, Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Part 25, Subpart A requires the NICS to provide Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL) with an immediate response regarding the person from whom the receipt of a firearm would violate the U.S.C.  If the initial response is a &quot;delay,&quot; the NICS is required to provide the FFLs with a final determination within three business days.  The NICS Regulation provides the states with the option to act as a point of contact (POC) for NICS background checks and allows the FBI to serve as the POC in those states that have chosen not to perform the checks.  The NICS Regulation required development of other electronic means of contact; as a result, the NICS E-Check was developed.  This function enables the FFLs to initiate an unassisted NICS background check for firearm transfers via the Internet.  When the FFLs conduct a NICS check, name and descriptive data is submitted to the NICS to determine if prohibitions exist.

Launched in 2004 as a web-enabled and paperless counterterrorism incident management system, Guardian's goal is to allow all terrorist threats and suspicious activities to be recorded and instantaneously accessible by all application users. Guardian benefits users by providing threat and suspicious activity information at a point when threat mitigation through deployment of resources is optimal leaving no threat incident unaddressed. 

The Guardian program incorporates two information systems, Guardian and eGuardian. The systems enable communication and collaboration between FBI, state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) law enforcement partners regarding terrorist threats, building strong and functional liaison partnerships for combating terrorism. These two systems also communicate and transfer information to other stakeholders in Department of Homeland Security organizations including the PM/ISE.

The classified version, Guardian, is used by all FBIHQ units, FBI Field Offices, Legal Attaches, Other Governmental Agencies (OGA) and Intelligence Community partners. Based on the application's success for threat analysis, the FBI has designated Guardian as the sole system of record for documenting all official counterterrorism early stage investigations known as Type 1 and Type 2 Assessments. Recently the stakeholder group has been extended to include the FBI's Counterintelligence and Cyber Divisions. Currently there are over 128,816 threat and suspicious activity incidents in Guardian with services extended to 25,102 registered accounts and 18,639 active users. Over 142,553 Guardian incidents have been closed resulting in 5,321 FBI Full Investigations (FIs) and 5,259 Preliminary Investigations (PIs). The unclassified version, eGuardian, has been deployed to the SLTT law enforcement partners via Law Enforcement Online (LEO). All citizens benefit from the one-way transfer of information from eGuardian to Guardian allowing mission critical information to be shared at a point when it can make a difference in the outcome of a terrorist scenario. eGuardian now contains 24,993 incidents and services 5,086 registered accounts and  1,472 active organizations.",011-040,"462 - National Security, 1320 - Prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur, 1322 - Investigate and prosecute espionage activity against the United States, 71501 - National Security","The Guardian Program, including the classified Guardian and unclassified eGuardian systems achieved a Return on Investment (ROI) of 390.8% in 2008 and continues to operate at the same level. The ROI reflects cost saving and benefits achieved through automation of the FBI s Counterterrorism Division s (CTD) Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) and threat reporting tools. Previously, threat information was shared through a labor-intensive manual process which caused delays and errors in information transfer. The Guardian Program s primary benefit to the Federal government is a web-based system which integrates the work of the FBI with the state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement partners and allows active cooperation. The collaboration achieved through Guardian and eGuardian promotes timely and quality information sharing for the purpose of creating actionable intelligence to combat terrorism without costly, bureaucratic expansion of personnel, facilities and information technology infrastructure. The system allows individual users to access multiple incidents from a wide geographical area, or many users to contribute to a single incident without the time consuming flow of paper reports from office- to -office or agency-to-agency. The SAR processing time has been reduced, from hours to minutes, allowing a greater number of people to collaborate on incidents and to target resources for investigation more effectively. The streamlined information sharing environment supports activities to complete a suspicious activity notification from citizen observation and reporting to action by the FBI or local law enforcement faster, more accurately and with less expense than ever before. Recently, Guardian has been deployed to the FBI s Counterintelligence and Cyber Divisions to implement their SAR systems without costly software development. 
Non-governmental organizations have gained access to eGuardian through new system enhancements that support extended web services.  One example is the eGuardian collaboration with a private sector partnership including businesses, academic institutions, state and local law enforcement partners and other groups who share information and intelligence to prevent hostile acts against the United States. These entities can now collaborate and share information at many levels.

CODIS is the generic term used to describe the FBI's program of support for criminal justice DNA databases as well as the software used to run these databases. The National DNA Index System or NDIS is considered one part of CODIS, the national level, containing the DNA profiles contributed by federal, state, and local participating forensic laboratories.  This automated DNA information processing and telecommunications system generates potential investigative leads in cases where biological evidence (DNA) is recovered.  CODIS links crime scene evidence to other crimes and/or offenders which identify serial offenders and/or potential suspects.  In addition, CODIS software specializes in missing person DNA searches as well as disaster victim identification. The CODIS Program started as a pilot project in 1990 with ten laboratories. The Federal DNA Identification Act of 1994 authorized the establishment of a national DNA identification index and in October 1998, NDIS became operational.  All 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice Crime Laboratories, the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Laboratory, and Puerto Rico participate in NDIS.  The CODIS Unit serves over 192 NDIS participating laboratories across the US and more than 80 international laboratories representing over 50 countries.  To date, NDIS contains over 14 million searchable DNA profiles and has aided over 274,000 investigations.  Reliability and expandability of CODIS are critical in the FBI's ability to effectively aid law enforcement investigations and serve the public through the use of biometrics. CODIS has no dependencies between this or any other investments.",011-083,"1325 - Combat the threat, incidence, and prevalence of violent crime","As the program is currently in O&amp;M (steady-state), the original ROI has been achieved. The routine search times have decreased from over eight hours to less than one hour. This reduction allows local and state lab's resources to manage their workload more efficient. With the enhanced performance architecture, NGCODIS performed a search of over 10 million offender profiles against 350,000 DNA profiles from crime scenes in less than one hour. The legacy system couldn't perform the same search due to size of the database and the system and performance limitations. There was an immediate benefit realized from the first full search as 30 new investigative leads were identified that were not previously found in the legacy system. One of the significant enhancements to the software was increased Missing Persons functionality. With the rapidly deployable software at the ready, crisis support became easier and will assist in mass disaster identification such as the Bangladesh garment district building collapse and previously for Air France Flight 447 and the Victorian Brushfires. The qualitative benefit to the public, domestic or internationally, is unfathomable when a missing person identification is made. Another major benefit to the user community was the creation and continued update to computer-based training software. Historically the CODIS Unit paid for labs to occasionally send staff to training, which ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. With the utilization of CBT, the only in person training is provided to International users who pay for the training. CBTs can be taken at user locations and can be taken at an individuals preferred pace. This new paradigm has saved the CODIS Unit a significant amount of money. The most significant benefit is the continued assistance in helping solve crimes but at a potentially faster rate than historically provided. With some crimes, time is of the essence, so faster response times often make a difference in solving a case.

The goals are: support the front line against terrorism; consolidate the government's watchlist into a single watchlist; maintain the Terrorist Watchlist, the No-fly List, and the Selectee List; and protect individual privacy and safeguard civil liberties. The Consolidated Watchlist is the most effective counterterrorism tool for the U.S. Government enabling front-line screening agencies to positively identify suspected terrorist. Thousands of records are updated daily and shared with federal, state, local, territorial, tribal law enforcement, the intelligence community and international partner.

Specific benefits include: continuous and accurate updates and enhancements to U.S and International No-Fly Lists; complete, timely and accurate encounter terrorist information provided to U.S and International Partners; updates of national and international terrorist databases with encounter information; and accurate screening and adherence to National Privacy Laws and Regulations. 1,000+ daily unique database transactions add, delete, or modify KST identities thus benefiting law enforcement personnel in the field; the personal risk associated with a law enforcement encounter is minimized because accurate, updated terrorist and encounter information is readily available. The terrorist screening process, supported extensively by IT staff, is a significant contributor to U.S. and International counterterrorism initiatives resulting in identification, deterrence and capture of KSTs. Incalculable cost avoidance includes: the cost of the loss of human life; the cost to replace/repair critical U.S. and International infrastructure; the cost to replicate the TSS across all intelligence organizations and the cost of multiple interfaces between organizations to ensure accurate, complete and real-time Law Enforcement information sharing. Additionally, an accurate and real-time no-fly list enables more secure and timely air travel both domestically and internationally; this benefit is not available any other way.

From 1994 through 1996, the Bureau negotiated contracts, procured equipment, and deployed LANs in nearly 60 institutions, six regional offices and the Central Office.  In 1997, all of these LANs were interconnected into a single wide area network (WAN). This IT infrastructure network of LANs, which are joined into a WAN via the Justice Telecommunications Network (JUTNet) is referred to as BOPNet. BOPNet is comprised of the BOP wide area network (WAN), the collection of local area networks (LAN), and network administration/authentication services used to provide BOP wide area networking. It interconnects the LANs across all BOP facilities, which includes correctional facilities, regional offices, community corrections offices and the central office.

The BOPNet computing infrastructure is used for the deployment of applications and as the means of communication to transfer messages and data. The infrastructure contains approximately 31,000 workstations and provides access to file and print services, email, the Internet, and various office productivity applications.  Similarly, because BOPNet provides the secure means for staff to access the Internet, individual institutions and offices do not need to add additional equipment or use local Internet providers.

The actuarial calculations that the systems perform are essential in determining eligibility and correct benefit amount for participants entering pay status (PBGC currently pays participants approximately $5 billion plus annually).

IPVFB calculates and integrates the amounts of future benefits of trusteed pension plans, those considered at 'high risk' of being trusteed, and others creating potential liability. As an internal benefit to PBGC, IPVFB supports the multiemployer program through the evaluation of multiemployer plan assets and liabilities, monitors potential errors in the benefit payment database and reporting errors to the case processing staff and produces the Present Value of Future Benefits results that are vital inputs to maintaining the PBGC's unqualified audit opinion. External benefits include IPVFB's computation of the present value of future benefits and expenses of PBGC which is used to report to the US Congress annually. Importantly it is a contributing source by which millions of American workers' pension benefits are secured.

CFS is PBGC's Financial System that captures all financial transactions and produces PBGC's financial statements. Deployed in 2006, CFS integrates three general ledgers; three sub-ledger modules; and related interfaces into a single installation of the Oracle E-Business Suite vR12 which is a COTS application. CFS enables core financial management business processes including financial reporting; general ledger and trusteed plan ledger accounting; investment assets accounting; budget execution funds control; cash management; administrative expense payments (benefit funding, financial assistance, vendor invoicing, payroll, and employee travel and training); and specialized financial reporting for program management decision support.

PPS provides the operational infrastructure to support PBGC's premium program including financial reporting, accounting, internal controls, billing and collections of past due premiums, and customer service. PPS consists of two main applications, the Premium Practitioner System (PPS) and the My Plan Administration Account (My PAA). My PAA is a web application Plan Administrators utilize to transmit premium filings and payments to PBGC. PPS receives premium filings and payments from My PAA, processes & posts them to plan accounts, and provides reporting capability. PPS also maintains plan demographic data, performs premium filing validations, calculates penalties and interest, generates billings for premiums in arrears, manages correspondence, documents action items, and reports data used in financial statements.  PPS maintains other essential data for PBGC's insurance program used throughout the Agency. For example, the Office of Negotiations and Restructuring uses the premium filing data in their assessment of PBGC's insurance risk exposure.

TAS provides the accounting for assets of recently terminated plans held by interim custodian banks and the commingled assets of prior terminations held at PBGC's custodian bank .  TAS also maintains the financial records for all trusteed plans, which includes accounting for future benefit liability calculated by the Integrated Present Value of Future Benefits (IPVFB) system.",012-020,"907 - Improve health benefits and retirement security for all workers","CFS houses and provides PBGC's investment and financial reporting of PBGC's financial position, and also facilitates required internal controls to safeguard PBGC's assets.

These include improving the quality and relevance of PPI and IPP indexes such as by expanding services coverage, producing new products that gauge U.S. competitiveness and compare IPP and PPI outputs, developing methods for better quality adjustments, and more sophisticated handling of intra-firm trade, among other key issues. This requires an on-going examination of the six business production processes to determine where the programs can make their methods and concepts congruent and then to determine how best to update the underlying IT. The IPS investment will consolidate many of its applications with the long-term goal of a single system supporting each business production process across the IPP and PPI programs.

The current system does not have the functionality of modern EHR systems, such as clinical decision support, e-prescribing, quality data reporting, a patient portal and biosurveillance reporting. The eMED system is not interoperable and not used globally. It does not comply with Executive Order 13410 and Meaningful Use (MU) criteria of HITECH Act 2009. The need for an EHR is in response to Executive Order 13410 mandating that all federal agencies must have an EHR that is interoperable with other agency systems.  In addition to fulfilling this presidential mandate, MU criteria, and HITECH requirements, MED seeks to improve the quality and efficiency of care it delivers across its global enterprise.

FinCEN's mission supports Treasury's strategic goal to protect our national security through targeted financial actions. To successfully fulfill its mission, FinCEN relies on secure, advanced IT to manage the collection, processing, analysis, storage, and dissemination of BSA information that contributes to the soundness and confidence in America's financial system. FinCEN is the administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act, which allows stakeholders to combine this financial intelligence information with other information sources to address issues related securing economic and financial stability and combat terrorist financing. Prior to the four-year, development effort that completed in FY2014, FinCEN faced the challenge of how to enable easier compliance and streamline BSA information capture for FinCEN's financial community stakeholders while maximizing the value and impact of BSA information for its regulator, law enforcement and intelligence community stakeholders. This investment addressed these challenges by providing an enterprise-wide information management and analysis framework that equips law enforcement and financial industry regulators with better decision-making abilities and increased value of BSA information through enhanced data integrity and analytical tools. This allows law enforcement and regulators to focus their limited resources on the areas of shifting illicit criminal activities and vulnerabilities effecting the soundness and stability of the U.S. financial system. In addition, the BSA IT Modernization investment enables easier compliance and streamlines BSA information capture for FinCEN's financial community through its enhancement of electronic filing systems for filers, standardization of financial data with existing financial community standards, and more timely and useful feedback on BSA information filings and the use of BSA information.",015-025,"1133 - Identify priority threats to the financial system using intelligence analysis and outreach to the financial sector, 1134 - Protect the integrity of the financial system by implementing, promoting, and enforcing anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing standards, 1136 - Develop, implement, and enforce sanctions and other targeted financial measures, 1138 - Improve the cybersecurity of our nation's financial sector","The BSA IT Modernization Investment supports FinCEN's modernized technical environment, which leverages state-of-the-art technology and is maintained at a Government co-located site, supporting Treasury's data center consolidation efforts. Since FinCEN chose to build a new systems environment using Government Owned Assets as its alternative, the return on investment (ROI) reflects more qualitative benefits, although some quantitative, estimated benefits do apply. As a result, FinCEN successfully assumed all system ownership responsibility from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), thus significantly reducing the IRS's operations and maintenance costs. In addition, the Program has allowed FinCEN to mandate electronic filing for all Title 31 reports, and FinCEN now averages a receipt of 97% of electronic BSA filings. This effort has reduced paper processing and offered Treasury an annual savings of $8-12M. FinCEN has greater flexibility and the ability to more quickly respond to its stakeholder's demands. The modernized infrastructure maintains more effective data security and audit technologies, including two-factor authentication, to maximize BSA data confidentiality and integrity. This initiative has improved time to respond to changes by reducing the number of work days required to develop and implement moderate impact changes to its BSA reports. FinCEN continues to improve with release planning efforts to address mandated changes to data collection tools, as well as defects and enhancements. In the area of data analysis, FinCEN has introduced more sophisticated web-based, analytical tools to its users.

HR Connect is based on a combination of (a) web-based solution built on PeopleSoft commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, (b) Software as a Service (Saas) platforms (e.g. Talent Management and Career Connector) and (c) internally developed applications (e.g. Entrance on Duty System). HR Connect transforms core back-office HR functions, moving them from a processing-centric capability to a strategic-centric capability enabled through its commercial software underpinning. Additionally, self-service components of the software fundamentally transform the standard government HR service delivery model, putting additional information, services and processes (i.e., personal data, position management, requests for personnel action, recruitment, reporting, etc.) directly in the hands of managers and employees.
 
HR Connect supports the common HR Line of Business processes and provides core HR functionality that is interoperable, portable and scalable.  This shared solution provides automated systems that are configurable to the individual organizations' needs while providing a single solution across the Department and federal landscape.  HR Connect's core functions include: Personnel Action Processing, Managing Payroll, Administering Benefits, Time and Attendance and Labor Distribution.  By enabling the retirement of legacy systems and automating and streamlining many aspects of human resources, HR Connect facilitates increased efficiency and overall productivity for its customers. HR Connect is the system used by all Treasury bureaus and several other government agencies (over 22 entities) with over 200,000 employees and contractors in total.",015-000,"1144 - Promote efficient use of resources through shared services, strategic sourcing, streamlined business processes, and accountability","The return on investment (ROI) for HR Connect is 140%, which is based on cost-benefits calculations for new HR Connect customers.

USAID calculated it would save $22 million in cost savings over four years by transitioning from a mostly paper-based system to HR Connect.  The Department of Commerce calculated that it would save over $50 million over four years by transitioning from a paper-based process to HR Connect.

HR Connect also provides an excellent value for the federal government as it expands its customer base.

As part of Fiscal Service's strategic Collections and Cash Management Modernization (CCMM) initiative, OTCnet has redesigned its business lines by developing one system per channel and streamlining the collection process.  OTCnet has fully incorporated the functionality of the two legacy systems (PCC OTC and TGAnet) into OTCnet.  TGAnet was decommissioned in June 2011 and all PCC OTC agencies were converted to OTCnet in 2012. PCC OTC has been de-activated for all agency access and it was fully decommissioned at the infrastructure level in August 2013.  Additional conversion activities in 2012 included converting agencies from CashLink and Ca$hLink II to OTCnet to support Ca$hlink II decommissioning.  By implementing the (Government-wide Accounting/Treasury Reporting System (GWA/TRS) project in 2012, OTCnet has facilitated data capture to support Central Accounting and Reporting System (CARS) reporting requirements for both check conversion and deposit reporting.

Decommissioning the two legacy systems, CashLink, and Ca$hLink II also provides efficiency gains through improved reconciliation processes.",015-028,"1131 - Improve the efficiency and transparency of federal financial management and government-wide accounting","OTCnet replaces two legacy systems (TGAnet and PCC OTC) and utilizes one service provider instead of two from the legacy systems.  By providing a shared service for all OTC collections globally, it eliminates the need for multiple systems across the government.  Using automated check processing functionality in OTCnet eliminates the need for manually processing the checks at TGA locations.  Using IBM Tivoli Identity Manager (ITIM) for single sign-on and automated user recertification provides productivity improvements to agencies for large number of users and less manual effort from the customer support team.  Utilizing a web-based training tool for agencies reduces the number of Instructor Led training requests in OTCnet and provides cost benefits.

The GWA/TRS project provides functionality to capture accounting information at the point of deposit and transmits the information to the CIR.  The Dynamic TAS project provides the capability to support the capture of multiple accounting code classifications at the batch level (summary level classification) and the individual check level (item level classification) in both online and offline applications.  This provides cost savings for the government in streamlining and centralizing the reporting of revenue collection information, and eliminates agencies redundant reconciliation processes.  With summary classification for TGA deposits and with the C-Key classification for checks, agencies can be GWA compliant.

STP allows all deposits processed through OTCnet to include the Treasury routing transit number (RTN) information which posts directly to the TGA structure and updates the TGA balance throughout the day.  This supports the Treasury goals of intra-day cash position, earlier end-of-day close and faster proofing, balancing and reconciliation processes. 

Processing of Adjustment/Correction and Rescinds for checks in addition to deposits improves agency reporting, supports decommissioning of FRB Ca$hLink, and also improves the reconciliation processes.

It includes the ability to ""decision"" electronic check transactions whereby checks are converted to ACH debits or truncated and presented as image cash letters to optimize collectability and reduce unit clearing costs.  It is built as a reusable service that can be utilized by other applications, so that these applications no longer need to present these transactions for settlement on their own.  The Debit Gateway is designed to implement an enterprise architecture goal of having one (and only one) system per Fiscal Service business line.   In this case, the business line is the settlement of electronic check and ACH debit transactions received via the collection channels on behalf of federal agencies, as opposed to each channel needing to provide settlement individually. 

The Gateway benefits the Fiscal Service's mission of providing financial services, because a large portion of the government's revenue is received through this application.  In addition, the Debit Gateway replaced a number of unnecessarily duplicative solutions in favor of a single, dedicated application for this business line.  In so doing, the Debit Gateway benefits agencies by providing better service, and also benefits the Fiscal Service by doing so at a reduced cost. 

Currently, the Debit Gateway processes transactions on behalf of multiple Fiscal Service collection channel applications: Pay.gov, OTCnet, Electronic Check Processing (ECP), and Agency Direct.  Eventually, it will also process ACH debit transactions for the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).  These systems depend on the Debit Gateway for an important critical  part of their daily operations, i.e., the completion of the collections function through the settlement process.",015-028,"1131 - Improve the efficiency and transparency of federal financial management and government-wide accounting","Debit Gateway life cycle benefits are based on the historically-observed unit cost for processing collection transactions through multiple predecessor systems versus the unit cost of processing through the Debit Gateway.

This multi-function investment directly supports the government-wide financial management mission of the Fiscal Service and is a partnership program with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The EFTPS is also part of the National Critical Infrastructure.

The primary justifications for investing in EFTPS are the following:
- maximize the percentage of tax collections received electronically by the federal government
- minimize the amount of time for taxpayers to complete a tax payment using electronic  payments 
- reduce the government cost to process a federal tax - provide a 24 x 7 x 365 mechanism to collect federal tax revenue
 
The Fiscal Service has been given authority for a Permanent and Indefinite appropriation from Congress as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Pub. L 108-199) to perform critical banking services on behalf of the federal government, including for the purposes of tax collection for FY 2004 and beyond.  Funds for this investment are allocated from this authority and are submitted to OMB on an annual basis as part of the congressional justification for the President's Budget.

FedDebt provides Fiscal Service with a single platform and entry portal for its business applications; online access for creditor agencies via a web-based customer interface; and a single database for reporting.  FedDebt integrates the collection services that Fiscal Services provides to FPAs through its TOP and Cross-Servicing programs.  TOP matches a database of delinquent debtors against outgoing federal payments and offsets or levies those payments to recipients who owe delinquent debts.  The Cross-Servicing program uses Treasury demand letters, Private Collection Agencies, administrative wage garnishment, repayment agreements, and other collection tools to collect delinquent debt owed to the federal government. In addition to debt collection, the systems within the DCS portfolio allow government users to quickly and efficiently access data, view reports and provide requested information to debtors.  Training on each of these systems is provided to users.

The Integrated Document Management System (IDMS) is also being reported under the DCS investment.  IDMS has been in operation since 1999 and currently supports 632 Fiscal Service users in sixteen configurations at seven locations throughout the United States.  IDMS provides customers Digital Document Storage and Retrieval, Digital Business Processes, and Records Management Solutions for the Fiscal Service internal customers.  IDMS integrates and supports Treasury Offset Program as well as Cross-Servicing.

The Debt Information Repository (DIR) is a critical component of the Fiscal Service's efforts to increase the collection of delinquent debt owed to the federal government.  The DIR standardizes data from operational data systems and other sources in a secure environment.

Approximately $17.4 to $32.5 trillion in auction bids are received and processed annually, with about $6.7 to $8.5 trillion in securities awarded at auction and issued.

IRIS is comprised of systems, applications, and business processes, all in constant communication to effectively support the USM's sales function for numismatists and the general public.  While the retail sales system was state-of-the-art at the time of implementation in 2001, United States Mint has failed to implement vendor-provided upgrades to the application software, resulting in an environment that fails to meet United States Mint business needs and presenting unacceptable risks. Specifically, the operating system and application software cannot be supported through standard service contracts and are unsupported by their vendors. Additionally, the hardware is no longer manufactured and cannot be replaced with new equipment in the event of failure.  
Some general facts about the USM numismatic business:
-617,000 unique purchasers, with numismatic revenue of $477.6 million and 5.6 million units sold in FY2012.
-802,000 unique purchasers, with numismatic revenue of $723.9 million and 7.3 million units sold in FY2011.

It is imperative that the USM replace the current IRIS environment so it can conduct its business in a productive, reliable and secure manner.
The primary purpose of this initiative is to replace the outdated systems and eliminate the risk of IRIS environment failure.  The objective is to replace the systems supporting the numismatic business process and to provide United States Mint customers with an experience that keeps pace with advancements in both technology and business functionality in the retail industry.

The MeF program supports the Treasury and IRS strategic goals by effectively and efficiently using resources to optimize return filing, expand e-Government, and reduce taxpayer burden.

Beneficiaries include the tax preparation community and the taxpayers they represent. MeF also benefits large corporations and tax-exempt organizations that are required at a specific asset threshold to electronically file their tax returns or annual information returns by reducing the handling/mailing of voluminous paper returns which sometimes exceed 700 attachments/schedules.

In addition, beginning in 2016, SCRIPS will process ACA-IRP Forms 1094-x and 1095-x.  SCRIPS scans and stores images of all tax documents processed, saving time by converting the scanned images and data to computer-readable code and providing hardcopy images when requested. This is accomplished using the Optical Character Recognition/Intelligent Character Recognition (OCR/ICR) engine in addition to utilizing 2D bar code recognition which optimizes and automates data entry of the taxpayer data.

SCRIPS is one of the front-end input systems that operates at four IRS Service Centers where forms are received, sorted, and then sent to the scanning areas. SCRIPS sends the electronic taxpayer data to the IRS downstream tax processing systems, including Generalized Mainline Framework (GMF) and Master File for posting to the IRS database, as well as Service-Wide Employment Tax Research System (SWETRS) and Statistics Of Income (SOI) for compliance.  Beginning in 2016, SCRIPS will send data to ACA Information Returns (AIR) database for Master Files. Images are archived and retained on the Enterprise Shared Storage platform. IRS Customer Service Representatives can request hard copies of images through the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS). 

SCRIPS processing of these forms directly supports the IRS's ability to administer and collect taxes while supporting voluntary compliance. The IRS has cited two strategic goals which are a direct link back to the Treasury Department's goals. Specifically, SCRIPS has a direct tie to the goal to collect revenue that is due the Federal Government. Images of these documents are used for research while resolving tax liability and compliance issues. SCRIPS processed more than 99 million tax forms in 2013 and more than 96 million tax forms in 2014.    

SCRIPS provides top quality service to all taxpayers through fair and uniform application of the law.",015-043,"1130 - Pursue tax reform, implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, and improve the execution of the tax code","The average cost-per-page to process documents on SCRIPS is between 1/15 and 1/20th the cost that it is on its sister system, the Integrated Submission and Remittance Processing System (ISRP).  Even though the cost of maintaining and updating the software is more expensive to perform on SCRIPS than it is on ISRP, especially the Annual Legislative and Forms Changes, the cost savings are realized very early in the Filing Season.   In Calendar Year (CY) 2014, SCRIPS scanned 96,366,091 taxpayer documents, and is on track to complete roughly the same number of documents in CY2015.  Considering the total cost to operate SCRIPS per year, including IRS FTE's in the program office, the contract with the vendor for maintenance and support, the cost of Enterprise Operations to support SCRIPS, etc, the break-even point for SCRIPS is about 5.5 million documents.  By the end of February of each year, SCRIPS has processed more than 15 million documents.  Thus, the break-even point for SCRIPS is acheived before the end of the 2nd month of the Filing Season.  

If the ROI is based on the following assumptions, then the ROI for SCRIPS is between 8 and 15.  
Assumption 1 - 5 year cost of operations on SCRIPS is roughly $50,000,000.
Assumption 2 - 5 years of scanned documents, at  90,000,000 per year is 450,000,000.
Assumption 3 - Cost Per Page of processing on SCRIPS is $1.00 less than ISRP (actual amount is higher).
Assumption 4 - Cost saved for 5 years is $450,000,000.
Then ($450,000,000 - $50,000,000)/$50,000,000 = 8.
If the Cost Per Page for Information Returns (IRP) on SCRIPS is $.08 versus $1.90 on ISRP, then:

As part of the 2006 Modernization Vision and Strategy process, IRS developed a strategy to use, retain, and provide real-time access to account data regardless of location in the current processing environment (CPE) or modernized data sources. Using a phased release strategy, AMS was able to validate this approach during its initial deployment in October 2007 using a service-oriented architecture implementation to access both CPE and Customer Account Data Engine (CADE).   In 2009 the Desktop Integration (DI) system was integrated into AMS and the Correspondence Imaging System (CIS) became an inventory within AMS.  AMS was fully deployed in December 2010 and is now in Operations and Maintenance. 

AMS provides multiple systems interfaces using only one computer terminal. The AMS application provides IRS employees the ability to access and update taxpayer accounts on demand, provides data presentation services to display and validate changes/updates for taxpayer accounts, facilitates management actions/activities (such as work assignments, transfers, case creation and closures, and generation of letters to taxpayer) and making case information readily available for decision making and reporting, provides the front-end applications for adjustments, penalties, interest, abatements, credit and debit transfers, name and address changes, bankruptcies, installments agreements, changes to the automated treatment streams and many other taxpayer account-related functions required for customer service and compliance and provides the functionality to monitor taxpayer accounts for follow-up activity or deferred actions.

From among the strategic goals set forth by the Treasury for fiscal years 2014-2017, AMS supports Goal 3: Fairly and effectively reform and modernize federal financial management, accounting, and tax systems; Strategic Objective 3.3: Pursue tax reform, implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, and improve the execution of the tax code.",015-042,"1144 - Promote efficient use of resources through shared services, strategic sourcing, streamlined business processes, and accountability","The Account Management Services (AMS) application provides a variety of research and case management tools for approximately 42,000 IRS employees.

In the toll-free telephone arena, IRS customer service representatives (CSRs) utilized AMS while answering over 31 million taxpayer phone calls for FY2014 (Oct 1, 2013 - August 1, 2014).  CSRs depended on AMS to provide detailed account history and other online tools (i.e., tax return view, worksheets and checklists) in order to respond to taxpayers efficiently and effectively. Further, in FY2013, there were approximately 6 million images scanned into the AMS system providing all AMS users with electronic copies of taxpayer correspondences.
AMS has several electronic inventories providing IRS business organizations with case workflow automation and mobility. The electronic inventories are systemically delivered to all ten IRS campuses allowing the IRS to manage taxpayer accounts and to balance employees' workload. For example, 732,216 priority refunds were worked, managed and controlled via AMS in FY2013. The ability to work transcripts electronically via AMS, rather than via paper is more efficient and provides a means to monitor programs in real-time. 
In addition, AMS provides mass reassignment and bulk case functionality. The AMS mass reassignment tool is used daily to balance receipts throughout IRS campuses and to implement site specialization.

The heart of the CADE 2 solution is an authoritative database for individual taxpayers that will transform the way the IRS approaches tax administration into the future. CADE 2 goals are: Establish a solid data foundation for the future by leveraging a relational database and daily processing capability; Continue the focus on moving away from 1960's technology so business processes can be realigned to enable better services and more timely compliance (i.e., aging infrastructure, applications and sequential flat file processing); Address the financial material weakness (FMW), demonstrate compliance with Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) and maintain our clean audit opinion; Improve security and privacy posture by addressing identified weaknesses; Create one authoritative source of taxpayer data.
Transition States 1 and 1.5 built and initialized the CADE 2 database in production.

It manages data retrieved from the Tax Master Files allowing over 60,000 IRS employees who rely on it daily to take specific actions on taxpayer account issues, track status and post updates back to the Master Files. It provides for systemic review of case status, alleviating staffing needs and providing consistency in case control. For example, each time a taxpayer phones IRS, the person answering the phone uses IDRS to log the call and answer any questions. IDRS issues notices and processes installment agreements, offers in compromise, and adjustments. Actions taken via IDRS include notice issuance, installment agreement processing, offers in compromise, adjustment processing, penalty and interest computations and explanations, credit and debit transfers among accounts and research of taxpayer accounts for problem resolution of taxpayer inquiries. Using data analytics, IDRS enables IRS to efficiently evaluate taxpayer data to inform enforcement and secure legal compliance, both domestically and internationally.

In addition to IRS employees, IRS internet applications depend on IDRS to provide back-end services to enable them to help taxpayers. For example, over 200 million taxpayers ask Where's-my-refund at irs.gov annually and over 3 million business taxpayers obtain Employer Identification Numbers via irs.gov instead of via paper.

a. As a result of H.R. 5552, Firearms Excise Tax Improvement Act of 2010, legislation changes the way criminal restitution is assessed, allowing IRS to assess & collect restitution as if it were tax.  A new sub-system, Restitution Assessment Project (RAP), was developed & allows employees to create, research, update & delete Restitution Assessment. The Database contains cross-reference information concerning restitution assessments against individuals & businesses. The benefits reduce the amount of adjustments to the financial statement due to duplicate assessments & reporting. Failure to have the ability to view accounts would be a detriment to the IRS' ability to validate & attest that these criminal restitution assessments are collected once as required.
b. IDRS enables IRS to answer the question Where's-my-refund? over 340 million times each year without assistance of a Federal employee, through www.irs.gov, the IRS2Go smartphone application, and the toll-free telephone number.  IDRS annually enables over three million business taxpayers obtain Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) via irs.gov instead of via paper.  
c.

Without access to other E-services there would be additional costs to taxpayesr & IRS. 
d. IDRS is the only system within IRS that directly services taxpayer accounts in a real-time environment. Each year, Congress passes legislation (Foreign Tax Compliance Act, Patient Protection &Affordable Care Act and Firearms Excise Tax Improvement Act) that mandates form creation or revision. Without consistent IDRS updates, IRS would not be able to maintain the consistency and integrity of tax cases, which would negatively impact the integrity of the Government's tax system.

The legislation requires reporting by U.S. taxpayers holding foreign financial assets with aggregate values exceeding certain thresholds to report information on those assets to the IRS each year. It also requires Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs) with U.S. taxpayer accounts to register, report annually to the IRS, and withhold and pay over to the IRS 30 percent of certain payments of selected U.S. source income.  

Treasury has also been working with foreign governments to negotiate Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) that address certain legal impediments surrounding privacy laws and the disclosure of accountholder information. In addition to foreign account and asset data submitted by taxpayers and entities, the IRS will be assembling and transmitting Bank Deposit and Interest (BDI) data on accounts held by foreign nationals from U.S. FIs to foreign government HCTAs, under agreements intended to facilitate FATCA adoption. 

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act investment encompasses the planning, development, and implementation of IT systems needed to support IRS' tax administration responsibilities associated with key provisions of the FATCA legislation.

FATCA Release 2.0; launched in 2015 delivered the functionality to support negotiated IGAs.  This release introduced the International Data Exchange System (IDES) which receives forms from FFIs and HCTA's through IGAs and transmits forms in XML format; the International Compliance Management Model (ICMM) which receives, processes, stores, and manages data received from various sources for future compliance activities, and; the Withholding and Refund (W&R) system which enables taxpayers to file refund requests against withholding; captures 1042-S recipient copy and freeze Chapter 3 and 4 refunds to individuals and entities.
FATCA Release 2.1, deploying in August of 2015, will enhance ICMM functionality expanding on the IRS' ability to process, store and manage FATCA forms received via IDES as well as other sources (e.g., ISRP). The release provides capabilities in preparation of upcoming legislative requirements to provide reciprocal data back through the data exchange.
FATCA Release 3.0 will expand on the FATCA 2.0 and 2.1 Reciprocal Data management functionality; document matching; Registration Bulk Upload capability; and enhance other application aspects to include Registration, IDES, ICMM, and W&R.
FATCA Release 4.0 will provide additional functionality relative to the modernization of international reporting and application of FATCA data to compliance.

The purpose of RRP is to implement a framework that will use leading-edge technologies to advance IRS effectiveness in detecting, addressing, preventing tax refund fraud and protecting United States Treasury revenue.  Using the analytics capability provided by RRP, the goal is to create predictive fraud and non-compliance detection models, which will seek out subtle data patterns to determine reliability of return data, including the filer's identity. 
 
RRP is critical for IRS mission success in tackling ever-evolving tax schemes in a sophisticated, scalable and adaptable manner. RRP will allow the business operating divisions the ability to perform analytic self-service to facilitate rapid deployment of new rules and models for non-compliance, emerging fraud schemes, and research.  In addition, RRP will improve workload management for the business divisions, RRP will develop rules and models that flag potential cases to facilitate case selection and to dynamically route anomalies/exceptions to different treatment streams, thus increasing efficiencies to assist in prioritization of workload.

The future state of RRP will have an expanded role beyond fraud detection and will perform the function of correlating data across multiple data sources.

The IDIB program serves internal customers including claims representatives and disability adjudicators as well as external customers such as disability applicants and beneficiaries. As a mature investment, will undergo a review in FY16 IDIB to align the agency's future strategic disability IT investments. 

IDIB's Health Information Technology (HIT) automation substantially improves the speed and consistency of medical information collected. The standardized format facilitates the ability of adjudicators to navigate the medical records that support disability determinations.

The Electronic Claim Analysis Tool (eCAT) promotes policy standardization efforts.  eCAT utilizes intelligent pathing and quality checks to assist the user in addressing policy issues relevant to the claim. It includes Management Information (MI) capability.

SSA's data centers secure and maintain demographic, wage, and benefit information on all American citizens, providing for prompt and accurate benefits payments.  The American public is SSA's primary beneficiary to the Agency's services; however, other customers include federal and state agencies that SSA provides services to through the NCC and the Second Support Center (SSC). The NCC, which opened in 1980, has been in continuous operation as a data center for more than 30 years. Many of the NCC's facility infrastructure systems are well past their designed life cycle. Without a long-term replacement, the NCC will deteriorate to the point that a major failure to the building systems could jeopardize our ability to handle our increasing workloads without interruption.  Over the last decade, SSA commissioned several feasibility studies performed by outside consultants.  These studies clearly established the need for a new data center facility.

SSA requested funding from Congress to buy land, build a new data center and migrate all current production data center operations from the NCC to the new NSC.  Congress approved $750 million of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds, of which Congress allocated approximately $500 million as the initial and subsequent funding for the new data center and IT migration (i.e. the process of moving all the current data center IT services and operations from the NCC to the NSC). The objective of this investment is to ensure the continued viability of SSA's data center infrastructure by migrating all IT services from the existing NCC to the new NSC.

SSA is moving IT Services from the NCC to the NSC. The primary reason the Agency is making the move is that the NCC can no longer provide the facility services required in a modern data center. Preparatory efforts are under way now to virtualize and consolidate significant portions of SSA's IT equipment, perform application and asset inventory planning and to formulate a concise migration plan so that SSA can meet this goal.  The anticipated benefit is the ensured viability of SSA's data center infrastructure after the implementation of this program.",016-000,"1037 - Maintain System Performance and the Continuity of IT Services","The agency identified and analyzed three transition strategies for migrating IT services from the NCC to the NSC.

This results in a greater capability to process work at the customer's first point of contact with the agency. Additionally, TII provides internal and external online user access to more comprehensive customer information and automated TII processes that are easier to use and less costly to maintain and modify. TII modernization activities share information with other SSA modernization programs to identify and leverage common enterprise architecture, data and services. SSA leverages these opportunities to help move the modernization efforts toward enterprise enhancements that benefit the agency as a whole.  

The TII Program has consolidated processes and systems that resulted in less costly maintenance and a reduction in risk. TII modernization is accomplishing its goal to improve service delivery by eliminating antiquated TII object programs, reducing stovepipe applications across the agency, and reducing maintenance costs through integration. This provides significant social benefits to the public by minimizing the time spent resolving questions and issues regarding claims.

The benefits of more efficient systems processing include: a reduction in work hand-offs, fewer calls, and access to more comprehensive customer information, which decreases the number of re-contacts and office visits. TII application modernization improves the automation rate of transactions. These efforts help reduce and eliminate labor-intensive manual processes and allow representatives to focus their attention on complex front-line customer service items, providing value-added functions. As part of the TII investment, older and more costly applications are being eliminated and replaced with efficient processes within the TII system. 

TII Investment has been a multi-year modernization effort that has delivered numerous projects to improve the value of the applications serving both internal and external customers.  TII Investment project activities will continue into FY17.  Although there are still several stovepipe object applications in use, the current TII Investment will be re-evaluated on the basis of determining if the Investment should be sunset.",016-001,"1037 - Maintain System Performance and the Continuity of IT Services, 1038 - Enhance and Execute Plans to Modernize Our System, 1051 - Increase Payment Accuracy, 1053 - Develop and Increase the Use of Self-Service Options, 1057 - Enhance the Customer Experience by Completing Customers' Business at the First Point of Contact","Due to the extraordinary number of users, and the critical role of the system, SSA decided to implement a modernized Title II system incrementally over an extended timeframe. From a budget perspective, this alternative also enabled the agency to manage the cost over an extended period. This approach mitigates the risks incurred by rapid technology changes and provides extensive benefits to the agency.

By taking advantage of modernization efforts and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) practices, Title II system will allow SSA to improve service delivery while providing less costly software to maintain and modify.  The Title II beneficiary processing and payment systems move to a more consolidated/integrated Title II system. This in turn enables a consolidated view of eligibility and payment information and real time benefit calculations enable better customer service.  

Through these modernization efforts, the consolidated system incorporates TII business logic, performed by standalone older software, taking advantage of SOA, enterprise data architecture, and more modern software development platforms.  By retiring older, more difficult to maintain software, we improve our Title II application portfolio posture, allowing for modernized software that is easier to enhance when addressing our customer needs, while at the same time assuring that our changing workforce will have the skills to maintain/enhance the software as we move forward.  
    
Modernization efforts enable field office personnel to process initial claims and post entitlement actions in an online interactive mode.  This real time online access to the Title II processing environment allows instant feedback on whether claims are complete or require additional information.  Reducing the number of interactions between SSA and the claimants provides the benefits of minimal time spent in the field office or on the phone by our claimants as well as provides for positive public relations.

DCPS will transition the DD components from 54 fragmented, highly customized legacy systems to a common system that uses automated tools and leverages current technology.  Replacing the current DD component systems with DCPS will minimize the average processing time for initial disability claims, decrease case processing-related task time and provide increased system availability to improve the overall quality of the disability determination process.  This supports the agency's strategic goal to serve the public through a stronger, more responsive disability program.

Once operational, DCPS will deliver common functionality and consistent support to each DD Component, while providing accurate, current, consistent, and accessible data.  No longer maintaining multiple systems, SSA will implement software enhancements and modifications required by laws, regulations, and business rules more efficiently and consistently, and at a reduced overall cost as compared to the current legacy system environment.

DCPS will benefit SSA's disability process functionally and technologically by providing full process integration, ease of sharing disability processing workload across DD Component sites, a common interface with other SSA offices and systems, and a dramatic reduction in the technological complexity of system support. DCPS will provide a single system that integrates the entire claims process from start to finish, including case processing, correspondence, fiscal, management information, and workload management.

The EIMS investment was consolidated with AIMS and TFA for BY16. EIMS currently works to meet this objective through three main programs/projects: 
1) Access and Identity Management System (AIMS)
2) Two-Factor Authentication (TFA)
3) Person Authentication Service (PAS) 
The EIMS investment has both DME and O&amp;M (Steady State) components in five separate areas.

2) Development of the Access and Identity Management System (AIMS) High Availability Infrastructure
3) On-going support and enhancement for Two-Factor Authentication (TFA)
4) On-going support and enhancement for the Person Authentication Service (PAS)

EIMS provides ongoing operations and maintenance support to all of FSA's access and identity management solutions and impacts all of the ED and FSA stakeholders who use our systems. In addition, the EIMS investment supports efforts to continue to make systems more secure and meet Federal IT Security Requirements. Without EIMS, users (both privileged and non-privileged) would not be able to access systems in a secure manner.

AIMS provides the FSA enterprise with enhanced sign on capability and access control for web applications to privileged users (users with the capability of accessing more than just their own personally identifiable information (PII)). Currently, there are 21 major and minor applications behind AIMS serving a population of approximately 80,000 users. AIMS provides FSA applications with simplified logon. Supports signon for multiple applications, thereby enforcing standardized security requirements such as identity, password complexity, and multi-factor authentication.AIMS continues to serve a growing population of FSA applications, such as two-factor authentication, security training, rules of behavior acknowledgement, self-service password resets, and security access policy enforcement.

The return on investment will be achieved through improving the redundancy of AIMS ensuring users will be have ready access to FSA systems. AIMS provides secure centralized access decisions on users, based on security policy. It enforces rules and regulations of FSA and monitors, logs, and audits all authorized and /or unauthorized activity. AIMS automates common functions, such as password resets, saving time and money. AIMS provides improved single sign-on capability and support to legacy and newly implemented systems. This common infrastructure reduces costs for business units (e.g., FAFSA, Student Loans, NSLDS, etc.) by providing software, services and support that they do not have to repurchase or manage themselves.

Return on investment for TFA and PAS is in the form of increased compliance with federal and Department of Education security initiatives as well as cost avoidance. For PAS, the reduced risk is associated with removing PII from the user id and password. For TFA, multifactor authentication prevents unauthorized access through malicious activity including key logger attacks.

The investment in PM supports ongoing operations, maintenance, and customer support to manage collecting and integrating service enrollment information, and sharing that information in a timely manner across FSA systems as well as support to make incremental upgrades to its service.
If the PM system is not funded, the process of granting access to services provided by each of our various systems would become fragmented, causing confusion and security risks as certain tasks become impossible. For example, without PM, tracking of user enrollments, ensuring that only proper organization types are granted access to certain FSA services, and ensuring that inactive users are deactivated from those services when they no longer require them would be extremely difficult. Further, timely communication between FSA s various service-provider systems on user service eligibility updates would be next to impossible, causing public delays in access to vital FSA services on the front end, and delays to service discontinuances on the back-end, causing potentially serious security problems. And without a single system of record for tracking enrollment rights, FSA would be left with a patch-work of enrollment data stored on several systems, with probable data conflicts between those systems.

There are hundreds of small schools who would have difficulty or possibly not be able to participate in disbursing Title IV aid to their students without this product. The EDESuite software is an essential tool for many schools (more than 2100 at last count) to disburse aid and reconcile Pell Grant as well as Direct Loan funds. Provision of this software to schools results in reduced costs at the schools for supporting Title IV aid programs, lower barriers to T4 participation, improved customer service to schools and borrowers (through making aid cheaper/easier/ quicker to disburse and correct), and greater customer satisfaction due to simplification of the process of interfacing with FSA aid systems (CPS and COD).

The purpose of the Educational Assessment investment is to develop, maintain, enhance and support web applications and services for the NAEP and other assessments and to provide leadership and support in developing new web-based and other emerging technology applications. 

The intended result of the NAEP project within this investment is the successful administration of all national assessments, analysis of the information gathered and dissemination of the data results to the public. The benefits of this project include timely quality information about the level of achievement of America's children and web-based tools to allow policy makers, educators, and the general public to explore assessment data at the state and national level.  

The purpose of the international assessment project is to support the collection, analysis and dissemination of comparative international and U.S. assessment data of students and adults. The intended result is the successful completion of the projects and the dissemination of findings and related data.  International assessments include PISA, PIRLS, TIMSS, and PIAAC.

Other stakeholders of NAEP include parents, students, researchers, media and educators. The international assessments provide the only source of internationally comparative large scale assessment education data for the United States, allowing the public and stakeholders to benchmark the performance of U.S. students and adults in such key areas as reading and adult literacy, mathematics literacy and numeracy, science and problem solving. 

The NAEP program will save an estimated $4M in 2017 in printing costs that would have been necessary if the assessments in 2016-2017 were administered as paper-and-pencil. In 2015, the &quot;Electronic Pre-Assessment Visit (ePAV)&quot; was introduced and involves providing pre-assessment materials online, as well as other resources. This saves travel expenses and printing of hard-copy materials amounting to approximately $2.5M in 2016-2017. NAEP has also ceased printing paper publications and moved to digital dissemination of all data. However, by moving entirely to digitally-based assessments by 2017, the usage cost of technology will offset that savings. Overall, we may see lower program costs and reduced burden on schools. The program will benefit from technology-based assessments. NAEP and International assessments will glean finer-grain data (both observable and performance) to support diagnostic research and analysis. However, this activity is critical to success of the entire NAEP program for several reasons. As computers and digital tools play an increasingly important role in today's classrooms, NAEP must utilize the latest testing methods and item types that reflect the growing use of technology in education. Secondly, Common Core assessments, PARCC and SBAC are also using tablets to assess students students are not only comfortable with this testing technology, but somewhat expect it. Lastly, using a digitally-based assessment enables more universal accommodations, allowing for more inclusion of students.  For 2016 and 2017, overall NAEP costs will increase--some of the increase is due to the reclassification of work that has now become IT.

ERIC provides free public access to education research and information through an electronic database of over 1.5 million bibliographic records of journal articles and other education-related materials and, if available, includes links to full text spanning the period 1966 to the present. With a fifty-year history of serving students, teachers, librarians, administrators, and the general public, ERIC is one of the oldest programs in the U.S. Department of Education. Their primary goal is to add 4,000 new records to ERIC a month.

The WWC was established in 2002 to provide educators, policymakers, researchers, and the public with a central and trusted source of scientific evidence of what works in education. The WWC aims to promote informed education decision making through a set of easily accessible databases and user-friendly reports that provide education consumers with ongoing, high-quality reviews of the effectiveness of replicable educational interventions (programs, products, practices, and policies) that are intended to improve student achievement.

The RELs work in partnership with school districts, state departments of education, and others to use data and research to improve academic outcomes for students. They design tools and technical assistance help schools and districts better align research to practice.

Analytic Technical Assistance and Development (ATA&amp;D) and REL Peer Review (RPR) are designing a software program to allow schools and districts run high-quality research models without sophisticated expertise.

The results of the NHES:2016 web experiment should indicate more efficient use of incentives. That will result in a cost savings of at least $25,000 in FY 2016. The web experiment in 2016 will lay the foundation for full deployment of web instruments in NHES:2019 (FY2019), which could realize at least $100,000 in cost savings from incentives, and likely more.	

For HSLS, it is estimated that web data collection provides a cost savings of $86 per completed interview over telephone and in-person interviews for a total of 11,600 interviews, which equates to a savings of $997,600. Web interviewing saves about $165 per completed interview compared to field collection, which equates to a savings of $1.9M. Because web survey development costs only $1.2M, the estimated ROI is at least $1.7M.

The ED.gov website, which provides useful information to teachers, parents and students, is accessed by the public by over 1 billion page hits per year, serving 36 million users. All of the components of the ED.gov website are maintained to a very high level of availability to the public, 99.6 percent. 

This investment supports the ED.gov website at both the application and infrastructure layers. For the application layer, it provides engineering labor for the creation, operations and maintenance of website content; content development; and system enhancements. This service is provided by the web support contract. For the infrastructure layer, it funds hosting for the website s web 2.0 infrastructure layer (i.e., operating system, database, application server, and web server). This service is provided by the web 2.0 infrastructure contract. 

The ED Web investment receives its primary guidance and direction in identifying and implementing upcoming project-based enhancements to the ED.gov website from the Office of the Secretary and from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB has recently defined a Government-wide  Project Open Data  initiative. The direction defined in that document had a significant influence in the development of the Enterprise Architecture  Information Dissemination Segment Modernization Plan.

This document, also known as &quot;The 120 day study&quot;, was prepared by a multi-office Integrated Project Team (IPT) at the request of DOE Deputy Secretary Poneman with the following 4 goals: 1-Reduce DOE spending on Federal IT with savings redirected to achieving mission objectives; 2-Improve quality of service delivery; 3-Strengthen the ability to understand and manage enterprise-wide security risks; and 4-Minimize IT redundancies and complexity. In this study, the IPT defined four alternative approaches of possible service delivery toward achieving these goals. The alternatives evaluated were 1-Full Decentralization: Each Departmental Element(DE) operates and governs its own IT; 2-Full Centralization: A single provider owns and operates all IT services and capabilities across the DOE enterprise; 3-Current Model: A mix of individual DEs and service providers continue to supply technology and services; and 4-Targeted Change: The DOE moves toward being &quot;common where it can&quot; and &quot;unique where it must&quot; by consolidating common services where it makes sense, while improving the interoperability of services that are not consolidated. After significant analytical activities, supported through technical and financial analyses and documents from the Gartner Group and Accenture, the IPT recommended the &quot;Targeted Change &quot; approach that was subsequently approved by the DOE Secretary and Deputy Secretary.

Through an integrated approach, a common departmental cybersecurity strategy can be achieved across all DOE Security Operation Centers (SOCs). The purpose of SOCs is to monitor, assess, and defend Enterprise information systems (web sites, applications, databases, data centers and servers, networks, desktops and other endpoints). The JC3 will improve Enterprise cybersecurity and Situational Awareness (SA) through the dissemination of cyber-threat data and reports, shared information, enterprise wide response, and collective remediation. The JC3 also coordinates enterprise-level advanced analysis of cybersecurity events when requested by the DOE sites.

The primary objective of the JC3 program is to deliver a Departmental, functional cybersecurity capability as prescribed by this plan and within budgetary constraints. The program objectives are to:

 	Create, manage, and track a JC3 Project Management Plan and master milestone schedule covering all JC3- related program tasks.
 	Establish and execute a master JC3 budget tied to performance measurements.
 	Measure performance of all individual JC3 tasks and roll up these metrics into performance reports available to all stakeholders. 
 	Apply program management tools and techniques across all JC3 tasks, existing and new, to ensure schedules are met and services are delivered.
JC3 capabilities and activities fall within the following JC3 six primary functional areas:
 	Information Collection and Situational Awareness 
 	Advanced Analytics
 	Incident Management and Response 
 	Advise and Consult
 	Information Sharing and Reporting
 	Program Management 

JC3 will serve as the coordinating, monitoring, reporting, and response arm of the Department s Enterprise cybersecurity program. It does not replace site-specific cyber efforts or programs, but coordinates, standardizes, and unifies those efforts on behalf of the Department.

Participants in the CFM program include other Federal Agencies as well as the Electricity Sector   Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ES-ISAC), which is the primary conduit for DOE cybersecurity threat information to flow to industry partners. Additionally, the Cooperative Protection Program (CPP) collects DOE netflow information going back 2+ years which the JC3 team uses to identify threats, monitor activities, identify trends, and to scope the impact of vulnerabilities, exploits, and incidents. Both CFM and CPP are included in the DOE supported and industry led Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) which provides a parallel information sharing and situational awareness capability for critical infrastructure industry partners.

JC3 return on investment to the government includes both direct support as well cybersecurity support to the Departments role as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Energy Sector. In direct support the cybersecurity information collected and reports generated by the JC3 are shared directly with DHS US-CERT and other Federal Agencies to contribute to the shared situational awareness and protection of the Federal Government.

Based on analysis performed from the investment's Alternatives Analysis Assessment, our research proved that there would be significant costs that would be avoided based on Garterner Research for other Federal Agencies across the federal sector. The Alternatives Analysis projected $12M in overall benefits, and those benefits were realized due to the process of centralizing ID and Security Administration into a single support function, which in turn reduced Help Desk activity while utilizing simplified systems development initiatives.

Approximately $108.935 Million lifecycle cost avoidance for similar independent systems for other Federal Agencies:
$55.905 Million cost avoidance by centralizing ID, security administration, and its management of logical user identity and security activities. The estimated cost benefit for this area of cost avoidance is approximately $103,000 per IT system per year after implementation of the EPASS solution.  These projected avoidance/savings have been realized with the implementation of upgraded PACS throughout the various EPA Regions.
$35.140 Million cost avoidance by centralizing the user directory to allow a user to access all EPA IT systems with a single badge and PIN, thereby, reducing EPASS Help Desk activity, which ultimately reduces the number of User ID/Password credentials that will need to be remembered by the end-user. Utilizing a single badge and pin for accessing facilities and/or systems has been proven to reduce help desk calls by up to 40% in the commercial sector. The estimated cost avoidance per year at EPA is expected to be approximately $.065 Million per year per system after implementation of the EPASS solution.
$17.889 Million cost avoidance by utilizing simplified systems development.  The ability to tap into a centralized, well-tested infrastructure with an approved Risk Plan, Security Plan, and Privacy Impact Assessment is expected to reduce the cost of developing/re-engineering IT assets. This cost avoidance is estimated by Gartner to be between ten and fifteen percent of the cost of implementation for each IT system.

Phase I, implemented in FY2002, created an integrated system to support federal enforcement and compliance tracking, targeting and reporting, including GPRA reporting.   Phase II, also called Permit Compliance System (PCS) Modernization, expanded ICIS to include the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), enabled management of the complete program (e.g., stormwater), and replaced the legacy PCS.  PCS was an Agency Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) weakness, and the modernization of the system was critical to address the weakness.  Phase II was first implemented in FY06 for the online management the NPDES program. Electronic reporting capabilities were added for states to be able to flow Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) and other data from state systems via the Exchange Network and CDX to ICIS.  Electronic reporting capability was also added to receive DMR data directly from NPDES permittees. With the promulgation of the NPDES e-Reporting Rule, OECA is working to build tools to support additional electronic reporting from regulated facilities so they can flow more data to ICIS.  Phase III modernized the Air Facility System (AFS) via integration with ICIS. Phase III has increased transparency and accountability of federal, state, and local agencies and facilities by providing integrated and more complete data. Phase III has reduced burden for EPA Regions, state and local agencies, and the regulated facilities, by eliminating dual reporting info multiple federal systems and leveraging electronic reporting tools developed for ICIS Phase II. The Implementation of Release 1 of this phase occurred in FY15.  These innovations support EPA s Strategic Goal 5 (Protecting Human Health and the Environment by Enforcing Laws and Assuring Compliance) by ensuring that EPA and States have current and complete information to manage their Enforcement and Compliance programs.

Based on the individual costs and overall risks four alternatives were evaluated to determine, among other things, the ROI for the AFS Modernization. After costs and benefits for each alternative were identified and adjusted for risks, compared in present value dollars, Alternative 3: Full ICIS Integration was selected as the best alternative.  This alternative provided the highest benefit of the three viable alternatives for integrating AFS into ICIS, with an overall ROI of 1.75.

The qualitative benefits found for this alternative were: Time/Schedule - proved the implementation of ICIS will meet the timeframe, Resource Availability - the talent required for operating and maintaining ICIS is readily available in the marketplace, System Scalability - the original ICIS concept included the capacity to store AFS data, Maintainability - ICIS is supported by extensive documentation, and the skill set required to maintain common products is available and support will also be available from the vendor of the product, Reliability - ICIS has been tested extensively and chosen, in part, for its track record in the marketplace, Efficiency - the system is an Oracle database and is expected to meet at least a minimum standard for query response times, Usability - ICIS can be expected to easily interface with the state systems and meet at least a minimum standard of usable interface design. ICIS will also allow for easy data retrieval out of system and has been chosen, in part, for this feature, Security - ICIS will inherently include security features designed to address the security challenges of modern network environments and Conformance to EPA Standard - ICIS meets these standards and has been chosen, in part, for its ability to comply.

The analysis revealed the quantitative benefits to the government were:  Reduction in time to report to the modernized AFS system, reduction in training and user support costs, reduction in staff time and administrative costs due to improved availability and maintenance of e-documentation, reduced FOIA processing time and enhanced reporting capabilities, and reduction in human lives lost due to increased Enforcement and Monitoring Capacity of the Clean Air Act (CAA) stationary sources.",yes,yes,no,yes,162.5039,16.153,15.814,19.373,2001,2024,"The change in the funding level of the PY 2015 compared with the President's Budget for the same year was due to not receiving planned funding to support the E-Enterprise initiative, which included $1.5 M for Electronic Notice of Intent (eNOI), $1.120 M for Net Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR), and $.749 M for Air Facilities System (AFS), and $2.0 M for AFS Modernization.

By re-using centralized services, the EPA program offices and Environmental Information Exchange Network (EN) partner governments will avoid redundant investment in the development and operations of information exchange and identity management services.  A quantitative and qualitative ROI study was documented in 2007 that demonstrated cost savings and value from CDX services.  This ROI study is currently being updated. To date, the ROI study update has included reviewing past and present financial data, and conducting experience interviews and analysis regarding the five (5) selected Program Offices. Draft results presentations have been completed for all data flows and the project team is currently finalizing presentations and conducting executive briefings.
 
All five Program Offices analyzed have experienced significant benefits. For example, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI data) quality has improved as the number of errors/submission has significantly dropped through CDX usage.

These are the primary mission needs addressed by the FTI program. In the course of achieving this primary objective, the FAA has also taken the opportunity to make significant improvements in efficiency and cost effectiveness. As part of the initial implementation, the FAA consolidated services from nine different legacy networks into an integrated infrastructure. The consolidation provided significant cost savings benefits through economies of scale (resulting in a lower unit cost of bandwidth) and the elimination of duplicative functions for each network (e.g., program management, network engineering, security management, etc.).

ANICS uses primary and alternate satellites to meet FAA Order 6000.36 to provide system circuit diversity and redundancy.  ANICS availability has fallen below required availability and continues to decline. Outages are increasing in both frequency and duration. Many system components have either reached the end of their useful life or are no longer supportable. The arctic climate degrades the equipment due to cold cycling, corrosion, and wind damage.

ASTI supports the DOT and FAA strategic goal of Safety by improving availability and reliability performance statistics. Air safety is improved by minimizing outages for critical and essential communications links between pilots and air traffic controllers, but current system availability has fallen below required standards. ASTI will achieve its objective by acquiring and providing Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment, COTS Replacement for the ASTI NMCS and associated support services.

It improves the controller's ability to maintain awareness of the operational environment and to anticipate contingencies. ASDE-X was developed to aid in preventing surface collisions and in reducing critical Category A and B runway incursions. ASDE-X Safety Logic (AXSL) uses surveillance information from ASDE-X to determine if the current and projected positions and movement characteristics of tracked aircraft and vehicles present a potential collision situation. Visual and audible alerts are provided to air traffic controllers when safety logic predicts a potential collision. Deployment of the 35 ASDE-X systems was completed in FY 2011. The first ASDE-X system was delivered in 2002. Some of the equipment has reached the end of its service life and is no longer supportable. The ASDE-X Tech Refresh effort provides for the replacement and upgrade of hardware and software to ensure the continued operation of the surface surveillance system through its designated lifecycle. The approved ASDE-X program baseline includes costs for tech refresh. ASDE-X supports the FAA's Next Level of Safety strategic goal, specifically the outcome to reduce aviation risk through all phases of flight (gate-to-gate). ASDE-X reduces the risk of runway incursions through enhanced safety performance by supporting target projections and intersecting runway alerts, more accurate positions with flight call signs and aircraft intentions on the controller's display, and improved surface surveillance during rain. The ASDE-X Tech Refresh effort will ensure the continued operation of ASDE-X systems through its designated lifecycle. Completing Tech Refresh will keep the number of Category A&B runway incursions at the reduced levels attained during ASDE-X system deployment. As part of the NextGen roadmap, the ASDE-X multilateration system will be retained as a backup to ADS-B.

Before ATOP, there was limited aircraft tracking and no automated communications for oceanic air traffic. Pilots would radio position reports based on onboard aircraft navigational systems to the controller. Due to the uncertainty in position report reliability, overseas flights required greater separation margins to ensure safe flight, and were rarely able to obtain maximum fuel efficiency, minimum travel times, or access to preferred flight paths. The ATOP program replaced oceanic air traffic control systems and procedures and modernized the Oakland (ZOA), New York (ZNY) and Anchorage (ZAN) Air Route Traffic Control Centers with a satellite-based, integrated oceanic system. Today ATOP allows oceanic controllers to be in touch with aircraft in mid-oceanic flight and allows properly equipped aircraft and qualified aircrews to operate using reduced oceanic separation criteria. This enables more aircraft to fly optimal routes, enhancing aircraft flight time (and fuel and payload) efficiency during oceanic legs of their flights. Reduced lateral (side-to-side) separation allows tighter aircraft spacing around optimal city pairs. Reduced longitudinal (nose-to-tail) separation provides more opportunities to add flights without additional delays. The primary beneficiaries of this investment are the airlines, the flying public and the FAA air traffic controllers.

Benefits were calculated in relation to Airline Direct Operating costs (ADOC) for Both Atlantic and Pacific routes, and consisted of fuel savings, and reductions in airborne and ground delays. ATOP is a mixed life investment. In June 2009 a Post Implementation Review (PIR) found that available data did not allow for monetization of fuel savings or ground delay benefits but it did allow for examination of metrics like altitude change requests and the identification of ATOP related process efficiency benefits. The PIR analyzed trends at several airports and found that ATOP was shown to decrease controllers' response times, allowing the FAA to respond to ltitude change requests more quickly. The decreased controllers' response times enabled an increased number of altitude change requests, cleared requests and percentage of cleared requests handled by controllers, demonstrating the benefits of the ATOP program.

The TBFM system processes flight data, radar data, and weather data to produce efficient airport arrival sequences enabling better utilization airport capacity. Prior to deploying TBFM and its predecessor system, air traffic controllers (ATC) used manual procedures to manage air traffic flow, which often left gaps in the arrival streams.  TBFM's Work Package 2 (WP2) was in the Solution Development and Implementation phase from FY10-FY15. WP2 is composed of two primary components: (1) Re-architecture of the TMA platform, and (2) designing, developing, testing and implementing new functionalities. TBFM WP2 is built upon time based metering, successfully demonstrated in TMA, and other recently available technologies to increase arrival throughput and decrease costs and delays. TBFM WP2 expanded time based metering capability to more sites, reduced delays due to flight scheduling constraints. TBFM WP2's Integrated Departure and Arrival Capability (IDAC) automated the coordination and management of departures over shared and congested National Airspace System (NAS) resources. TBFM implemented .XML, supporting the FAA's Enterprise Architecture, to facilitate easier adaptation of data to other systems and permit sharing of data between systems.

Quantifiable FAA benefits result from the avoided costs of maintaining and refreshing legacy En Route systems and from streamlined information processing in the ARTCCs. Quantifiable user benefits result from an increase in safety and efficiency of the NAS. Safety benefits result from reductions in projected operational errors, operational deviations and the possibility of mid-air collisions. Efficiency benefits result from improved NAS throughput and better routing, as well as having a fully functional backup system.

The SASO Program is designed to improve, standardize and automate the FAA's safety oversight system, inspection policies and processes in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) SMS principles.  Using a multi-phased approach, SASO will implement its primary product, the Safety Assurance System (SAS), a risk-based, data-supported system that assists Flight Standard's Service (AFS) Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASIs) in doing their jobs more effectively and efficiently.  ASIs are responsible for oversight of nearly the entire civil aviation industry that uses America's National Airspace System (NAS).
The SAS will help provide automation tools and decision support for ASI's oversight of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Parts under their responsibility and assist ASIs in providing a thorough risk assessment through better and more complete data collection and analysis.  Phase 1, which is complete, was the planning and engineering phase designed to develop and test the SAS concept.  Phase 2 is development and implementation.  Oversight processes are redesigned for efficiency and integrated with system safety principles; tools and automation technology is developed and integrated into enterprise systems to support ASIs.

A small amount of efficiency benefits will be derived from time saved by FAA inspectors due to re-engineered business processes and single source access to safety databases, representing about 5% of the total estimated benefits.  These benefits are estimated by analyzing past accident reports to determine the proportion of accidents in which causal factors leading to the accident could have been prevented had the SASO investment been in place.  This analysis is applied to FAA's Terminal Area Forecast estimates of the number of future flights for each of the applicable 14 CFR Parts.  It is assumed that the accident proportion remains the same into the forecast period, both in terms of the number of fatal accidents and in terms of the number of aircraft destroyed or damaged.  Once an estimate of the number of avoided accidents is calculated, the average number of fatalities, serious injuries, and minor injuries from the historical data is used to estimate their value in the forecast period.

To translate this estimate of SASO's mitigation capacity into dollar terms, DOT guidance on the value of avoided fatalities or equipment damage is applied to the forecasts.

Additionally, the construction of the application on a business management process platform enables a more rapid response to the development of enhancements and modifications to the application than has been possible in the past. The application serves the leasing business line across eleven (11) regions and the delegated lease authority for multiple agencies throughout the federal government.  GREX addresses the limitations of the previous leasing application. G-REX is a completely modularized and de-coupled SOA-enabled system where the user-interface (human processes), business processes, middle-tier and database-tier operate and function independently while remaining in synch with each other.

The IAE vision is to continue to evolve and integrate the existing shared portfolio of electronic systems used for awarding and administering Federal financial assistance and contracts.

IAE systems support the needs and requirements of the acquisition and financial assistance communities in the following ways:

1. System for Award Management (SAM) - Vendors register to do business with the Federal government. Grantees, loan recipients, and agencies register to seek financial assistance from the Federal government.
2. Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) - Vendors find Federal government opportunities.
3. Wage Determinations Online (WDOL) - Agencies obtain appropriate Service Contract Act (SCA) and Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) wage determinations for contracts.
4. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) - Grantees learn about various Federal assistance programs.
5. Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) - Vendors report subawards in eSRS.
6. Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) - Vendors report subawards.
7. Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) - Agencies report contract actions.
8. Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) - Agencies access and review contractor past performance reports.
9. Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) - Agencies access and review contractor past performance reports.
10. Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) - Agencies access and review any entities that have been excluded from doing business with the Federal government.

The ACE and OMB representatives developed a set of evaluation criteria for the IAE PMO to use in selecting a way forward for the program. The evaluation criteria included performance, cost, risk, integration, and schedule. The Strategic options were scored against these criteria.

The program envisaged SAM as the core of a single integrated system replacing all the IAE legacy systems.  Problems with initial deployment of SAM put these plans on hold.  Because the IAE was managed as multiple independent systems that implemented one or several steps in the acquisition and assistance processes for government agencies, but without focus on user defined and user-designed functionality across systems, the resulting product exhibits significant functionality problems (external perspective) as well as, significant technical debt (internal perspective). The combination of schedule slippages, cost overruns, functional problems, and technical debt caused the analysis team to seek alternatives to using SAM as the basis for future consolidation.

As part of the initial activities to design a root-cause mitigating strategy, five proposed alternatives were simplified to three Strategic Options; 1) Rebuild SAM then fence and operate, 2) Rebuild SAM then continue as planned, and 3) Rebuild SAM and move forward with a different approach. A high-level analysis was conducted covering the three Strategic Options.

Based on the scoring criteria, the chosen option was to Rebuild SAM with 3 Cores and API. The internal and external benefits of this option include; Focus on business processes (vs. systems) improves business value, enabling the IAE PMO to maximize ROI,  Multi-vendor strategy limits schedule/cost risk, Aligns vendor incentives (SLAs) w/PMO objectives, Expands Data Warehouse into real Business Intelligence to support data-driven policy goals, Maximum support for broader integration with other GSA systems &amp; programs, creates sophisticated environment for 3rd party providers to innovate and reduce long-term costs, and addresses diverse user population needs.

To support this mission, the CAP program developed business cases to support improved analytics.  The Acquisition Services Platform includes two major initiatives: establishment of a cloud-based service for housing data and tools and initiating Analytics as a Service (AaaS) to leverage acquisition expertise, inter-agency perspective and skills, and buying power to procure analytics solutions for federal agency customers. This consolidates disparate procurement structures and approaches for analytics into one government wide resource and thereby support a government-wide shared platform.

Therefore, the Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated by determining the net benefit, which in this case is the total cumulative cost avoidances for reduced mailings, systems decommissioning, reduced data entry, call center calls, and file movement and storage over the lifecycle of the system (FY12-33), dividing the net benefit by the total initial capital investment, subtracting 1, and converting the remaining figure to a percentage.

A negative 44% ROI indicates that this investment will recover some of its initial purchase and implementation of new capital assets to create a new capability.

VIS is the single source of eligibility verification for those seeking employment authorization or access to certain benefits in the US. 
 
E-Verify and SAVE are mandated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA).  E-Verify is an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States. SAVE is a program that enables benefit-granting institutions, licensing bureaus, and other governmental agencies to determine an applicant's immigration status
VER MOD supports the DHS mission to Enforce and Administer our nation's immigration laws by strengthening the infrastructure for the E-Verify and SAVE programs.
 
The goal of VER MOD is to address the reliability, scalability and functionality challenges that currently impair efficient operations of the E-Verify and SAVE programs. Specifically, the goals are to address six identified capability gaps, decrease reliance on expensive manual verifications, increase system reliability, and expand capacity. The benefits of modernization will be streamlined business processes with reduced risks of identity fraud, data inaccuracies, and system misuse.
 
Failure to modernize will negatively impact the performance and quality of the E-Verify and SAVE programs, compromising DHS' ability to meet its mission to enforce and administer our nation's immigrations laws.
   
Primary users/customers include Employers and E-Verify Employer Agents using E-Verify to verify work eligibility of newly hired employees; Federal, state, and local agencies that administer benefits; and Verification Division employees and contractors charged with performing status verifications, identifying potential misuse of E-Verify or SAVE, and providing customer support.  In addition to users, VER MOD stakeholders include data partners such as the Social Security Administration and Department of State, Congress, immigrant advocacy groups, and employee rights organizations.",024-030,"3255 - Goal 3.1:  Strengthen and Effectively Administer the Immigration System","This investment in modernizing VER, an existing capability, will recover a majority of the acquisition costs both by significantly reducing operations and maintenance costs over the system lifecycle and by enabling the system to efficiently address the anticipated greater than 175% increase in verification workload expected over the planning horizon.  VER MOD will achieve these objectives by: Optimizing the effectiveness of VER operational staff using VIS and associated systems for verifications; by minimizing the need for additional staff to address anticipated verification workload growth; and by increasing system capacity in order to address expected verification workload growth.  VER's CBA assumes an aggregate Operational Improvement Factor (OIF) by year applied to the costs for addressing VER's workload during the sustainment phase that was derived from individual OIF's for each of the thirteen planned Modernization releases.  Each Modernization release's OIF was based on the extent to which it: streamlines and reengineers business processes; increases automation; simplifies and enhances system architecture; and adds additional technical and human centric capabilities that both decrease the manual workload associated with each verification and expand the capability of VER to address the anticipated increases in the volume of verifications. 

- Expand System Capacity: System capacity will be expanded to address the over 80 million queries per year and 200 thousand MOUs expected by 2027
- Streamline and Reengineer Business Processes: Streamlined and reengineered verification business processes will both increase verification accuracy and efficiency by reducing the need to use high touch non-automated processes and by increasing the accuracy and efficiency of manual verification processes.
- Reduce Data Entry: Employers will reduce the time spent on data entry due to the Mobile E-Verify application and photo-based text importing from Form I-9 to E-Verify. Improving the ease of use of E-Verify is an important aspect of increasing ease of adoption and improving customer satisfaction.

Each day, whether executing protective, investigative or administrative duties, USSS agents, officers, administrative, technical and support staff require secure, reliable and resilient voice and data communications networks, information systems, applications, equipment and IT services to operate effectively. The goal of ITI is to provide the resources and tools that enable USSS personnel to perform these essential mission requirements.  
   
Benefits and Contribution to Mission:  ITI is the information and communication backbone of the USSS.  It provides the enabling foundation for all mission-critical IT systems, supports secure sharing of information within the organization and with mission partners, and provides direct access to Law Enforcement, DoD, and other government agencies.  ITI capabilities benefit and contribute to the USSS ability to efficiently and effectively plan, report and execute protective, investigative, and administrative activities, all while maintaining real-time communication interfaces with key mission partners.  ITI maintains day to day operational communications as well as communication requirements that support National Security Special Events (NSSE).  IT operations must ensure the network and supporting infrastructure is available 24x7x365 because of is critical importance to all USSS mission operations, NSSEs, investigations, and protection details.

The TSA's mission is to protect the Nation's transportation systems. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) mission is to detect, deter, and defeat hostile acts targeting U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews. The purpose of the Mission Scheduling and Notification System (MSNS) is to provide mission-critical, operational information support for the FAMS. The goal of MSNS is to help ensure that the FAMS is able to execute its transportation safety mission easily and efficiently, while providing system flexibility and evolving capabilities to meet changing mission needs in the coming years. 
Some of the current benefits of MSNS include its specific contributions to the FAMS mission: 
1) It automatically determines allocation of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) to flights using Industry-leading planning and manpower allocation software which incorporates TSA's risk-based strategies, FAMS policies, and individual FAM limitations;
2) It automatically coordinates and communicates mission assignments with Operations, Field Offices, and FAM personnel;
3) It automatically reserves, changes, and cancels airline tickets; 
4) Its automatic reservation and ticketing causes less disruption to the airline industry over manual methods;
5) It automatically tracks mission execution and supports operational changes to previous plans;
6) It provides live fail-over, disaster recovery, and Continuity of Operations (COOP) capabilities to ensure FAMS mission-critical information is available annually 99.999% of the time, 24x7x365;
7) It facilitates a smaller and stronger security perimeter around operational information by reducing the number of people needed to accomplish tasks in the FAMS mission.
 
The key customers of MSNS are FAMS leadership, operations and the individual FAMs. Other stakeholders include the TSA Office of Information Technology (OIT), TSA and DHS leadership, the U.S. Congress, and the President of the United States. Other beneficiaries are U.S. air carriers, airplane passengers, airports, and U.S. citizens.

Based on a further 5 years of utility, using the MSNS system results in a net benefit of approximately 5*$30.7M = $153.5M which was calculated based on input from FAMS Flight Operations division.
In addition, the following qualitative benefits continue to be achieved through improved automation:
Each month, MSNS facilitates coordination of thousands of air marshal availability schedules. This greatly reduces the amount of time it takes to create FAM missions.
Each month, MSNS automatically communicates tens of thousands of mission assignments with FAMS field offices and air marshals. This dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to notify the workforce of their assigned FAM missions.
MSNS is now able to more efficiently and more cost effectively reserve and purchase tens of thousands of airline tickets for air marshals every month. This drastically reduces the amount of time it would take to perform this task manually.
On a 24x7 basis, MSNS is now able to more accurately track FAMS mission execution and facilitate live mission updates in response to a wide variety of emergent conditions in the global air transport system.  This improved tracking capability increases situational awareness of personnel at the FAMS Transportation Security Operations Center (TSOC).

Purpose: to deliver a capability to assess risk through leveraging intelligence data, criminal history and immigration status information in order to effectively identify persons known or suspected to pose a threat to transportation security. 
The primary goal is to protect the national transportation system, through identifying and prohibiting high risk persons from holding a hazardous materials endorsement (HME), identifying low risk persons as eligible to possess a HME, and minimizing misidentifications of individuals as potential threats.  Performance Goals: timeliness, accuracy and efficiency, completing the adjudication process within 30 days; YTD average is 99% within 30 days or less; fingerprint reject rate is less than 0.4%.

The SF program operates a threat-based, watch-list matching capability for covered Aircraft Operators (AO) with flights into, out of, within, and overflying the U.S., and for covered U.S. aircraft operator flights between two international points and enhances the security of domestic and international commercial air travel by vetting aircraft passengers. SF's goals are to: support TSA's Risk-Based Security (RBS) mission by identifying high-risk passengers for appropriate security measures/actions, prevent individuals on the No Fly List from boarding an aircraft, identify individuals for enhanced screening, minimize misidentification of individuals as potential threats, incorporate additional RBS capabilities, and protect passengers' personal information from unauthorized use and disclosure.  A key benefit is that SF provides a consistent, effective means of meeting these security goals within strict privacy requirements. AO's benefit from the SF program through improved aviation security, streamlined redress processes, relief from the watch list matching burden, timely & accurate matches and resolution, and government response coordination. Through the requirement that passenger data be sent as early as 72 hours before departure, SF benefits to stakeholders and contributions to TSA mission include: providing early insight into potential matches to the watch list; providing an interactive capability for recurring or manual watch list matching on a 24/7 basis through the SF Ops.

The return on investment from SF, therefore, is the strengthening of national security provided by the program's real-time name matching and vetting services from aircraft operators (AO).  SF adds value to the national security and counterterrorism mission by identifying high & low risk passengers in order to mitigate known and unknown threats to aviation security that AO could not perform.  SF benefits the traveling public, US Government agencies with equities (e.g., DHS, DOJ, CBP), and the aviation industry for its ability to designate passengers for standard screening, expedited screening, or prohibition from boarding a covered flight, as appropriate. Primary nongovernmental users are aircraft operators, who are required to submit passenger data to Secure Flight to identify passenger matches and generate an accurate boarding pass printing result. In addition, aircraft operators benefit through improved aviation security, streamlined redress processes, relief from watch list matching, timely and accurate matches and resolution, and government response coordination (including law enforcement).

These statutes require DHS to prevent individuals from entering a secure area of a vessel or facility unless the individual holds a transportation security card or is accompanied by another individual who holds a card.
Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 1.0, dated January 2013, the TWIC program supports the PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY. Mission and the Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio.  As of May 2014, more than 3.0 million workers applied for a TWIC.
Goals: The TWIC program provides a vital security measure to ensure that individuals who pose a security threat do not gain unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation industry. 
Current or Anticipated Benefits: TSA (1) positively verifies each applicant's claimed identity; (2) performs a security threat assessment on each applicant; and (3) produces and issues a TWIC card containing biometric and physical information for each applicant meeting the threat assessment eligibility requirements. The TWIC security threat assessment provides a terrorism/intelligence check, a criminal history records check, and an immigration check. TWICs are tamper-resistant biometric credentials. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Key Customers, Stakeholders, and other Beneficiaries: Workers who may be required to obtain a TWIC include facility employees, longshoremen, U.S. mariners, deckhands, long haul and drayage truck drivers, laborers, and other individuals requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels. The TWIC program maintains an extensive outreach effort to an exceptionally diverse group of key stakeholders: Congress; American Association of Port Authorities; National Association of Waterfront Employers; American Trucking Association; American Waterways Operators; Offshore Marine Service Association; Passenger Vessel Association; Intermodal Association of North America; International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union and others.",024-024,"3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","To calculate ROI, the program did a cash flow analysis using the TWIC Funding History report published by the TSA CFO which has the history of funding for the program up to September 30, 2013.  ROI for the TWIC program is calculated as (Cash In - Cash Out)/Cash Out.  Cash In is derived from two sources, appropriated funding provided early in the program and fee revenue collected from transportation workers once the program reached operational capability.  Consequently, as of September 30, 2013, Cash In = (Appropriated funds ($87.800M) + Fees $269.293M) = $357.093M; Cash Out = $309.636M; therefore ROI = $357.093M-$309.636M/$309.636M = 15.3%.  The details for this method are included in the first tab of the TWIC Funding History report which is uploaded.
 
The program has been in Operations and Maintenance since October 2008. The program's external benefits include providing a biometric credential to over 3.0 million transportation workers as of May 31, 2014. TWIC is one part of the layered approach to port security and establishes a minimum, uniform, vetting and threat assessment requirements for mariners and port workers across the country.  The nationwide recognition of TWIC as the one common credential needed to allow a worker unescorted access to secure areas of facilities and vessels enables facility and vessel operators to verify the identity of individuals, including the use of biometrics-steps that were not feasible prior to TWIC implementation with potentially thousands of different facility-specific credentials.  The credential is being used in over 2500 MTSA-regulated maritime facilities and vessels nationwide.  Through the use of a universally accepted common access card, the TWIC system has eliminated the duplicative costs associated with redundant credentials and application processes, thereby reducing costs to the individual transportation worker.

The TIM Program mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security.  TIM System is supporting operations by reducing the probability of a successful terrorist attack on the transportation system by applying threat assessment methodologies intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working in or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system. TIM is being built and operated in the DHS datacenter cloud environment to be a fully integrated system utilizing service oriented architecture capable of providing more effective and efficient security threat assessments to all areas of the transportation sector including, surface, maritime and aviation areas.  Using Service Oriented Architecture in the cloud environment, TIM provides services to maritime and is being expanded to serve surface and aviation transportation programs.  TIM has become the infrastructure focal point for stakeholders including; Congress, FBI, State Department, Coast Guard, State & Local agencies, U.S. airports, U.S. ports, transportation employers & unions.  The goals are to improve customer service, one-stop shopping, person-centric view to enroll, once and use many, increase efficiency of security threat assessments and information sharing with federal, state & local and industry partners promoting secure operations, support fee-fairness and comparability between credentials for the millions of transportation workers; realize economies of scale; and operational efficiencies through integration of processes.  TIM customers (transportation workers and travelers) will benefit from the efficiencies and cost avoidance once TIM is fully implemented.  Workers experience improved service at a lower cost.  TIM is poised to be an Enterprise-level solution for Screening Coordination Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiatives (CFI).  TIM is one of the first DHS programs to use DHS Data Center Cloud Services TIM is paving the way for new security and data sharing methodologies.

Though not fully implemented yet, the TIM Program is already eliminating redundant business practices, processes, and achieves significant economies of scale benefits associated with a unifying business integration effort.  TIM enables support for external stakeholders such as Maritime, Surface, and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations.
Internal benefits to TSA include cost and performance efficiencies that will be achieved by through streamlined business integration of now separate IT systems (TWIC, Consolidated Screening Gateway, Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program, Crew Vetting, Alien Flight Student Program) functionality under TIM.  Additional internal benefits include enablement of information sharing across TSA / DHS.  The TIM system is being built in the cloud environment at the DHS datacenters, which will in turn result in significant cost avoidance will be realized in the future years when the system is in the O&M phase.  
External benefits to stakeholders include streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person centric.  TIM is a person centric system that recognizes workers applying for multiple credentials, endorsements, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation or commercial modes.  This comparability capability enables TSA to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities and saves users time and money.    
The STA process uses the biometric and biographic information to conduct an automated immigration check, a criminal history check and finger print check, and a terrorist watch list check.  The approved STA is required for the worker to start/continue work or to apply for a job, any significant delays impact the worker and may impact commerce.

The primary goal of the investment is to support the systems that enable TSA to regulate the activities of Air Carriers and Indirect Air Carriers (IACs), regulate and approve companies to conduct screening operations, and determine the identity, validity, and risk of companies shipping goods on passenger aircraft.  The investment supports QHSR Mission 1: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security and Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders. The investment consists of three major systems, IACMS, KSMS, and FAS, and two minor systems, STAT and DAT, that serve to capture and manage data that help TSA mitigate the risk of terrorist incidents with impact on security operations (domestic and international). IACMS manages the IAC certification and renewal process, ensuring IACs implement security programs that reduce the risk of terrorism.  IACMS also enables IACs to obtain Security Threat Assessments (STAs) for their employees and agents, vetting individuals to reduce the threat of insiders introducing explosive or incendiary devices into commerce. KSMS vets shippers, reducing the likelihood that a shipper would introduce such a device.  FAS provides historical domestic and foreign air cargo screening data and is used by the TSA Cargo Targeting Unit (CTU) to manage time-sensitive data requests and identify high risk ports and entities via reliable risk data.

Primary benefits of this investment include improved oversight of regulated parties and shared security data (reducing costs and improving efficiency). By enhancing agent access to IACMS, deploying web services via KSMS, and automating manual processes via FAS, primary benefits include decreased time required for the vetting process, decreased transaction costs and processing times, decreased workload during the vetting process, increased data quality, and a reduction in the compliance burden by industry.

The goal of SEVIS is to track information on nonimmigrants who are participating in the U.S. education system or designated exchange visitor program throughout the duration of their approved stay. Nonimmigrants may temporarily come to the US to study under three classes of admission: F for academic and language students, M for vocational students, and J for exchange visitors. SEVIS greatly improved efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of the SEVIS electronic system increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants, and significantly increases data sharing across multiple government agencies reducing duplication of effort. Efficiencies are further improved through the ability of the web-based SEVIS application to be used in real-time for data updates and queries which reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information. SEVIS supports the DHS Mission by providing critical information needed to enforce immigration laws.

Among the alternatives analyzed, it provided the best return. This ROI indicates that external benefits will likely increase such that a portion of the acquisition costs will be recovered, although the program will not generate any additional ""return or cost savings. The other alternatives provided significantly fewer external benefits and thus reflect that very little, if any, acquisition costs will be recovered.
The ROI is negative because it represents an expansion of the existing TACCOM footprint where no sites or equipment exist. While additional O&M will be required to operate and maintain the added sites, there will be fewer site outages due to failing legacy equipment. Although the tradeoff is not sufficient to provide a positive ROI, it will somewhat decrease the O&M requirements.
This investment has significant benefits, both internal and external. TACCOM is a broad-reaching program that strategically supports a wide number of missions and goals, and its systems are integral to a wide number of missions and goals. The investment enhances ICE's TACCOM technology foundation, maximizes workforce productivity by providing expanded coverage and improved mobile command and control, and improves information sharing between ICE and CBP.

ACE will deliver these capabilities in a secure, paper-free, web environment. ACE will fulfill Executive Order 13659, which mandates the creation of a Single Window, known as the International Trade Data System (ITDS), by December 2016.  ACE is the system through which the Single Window will be realized.  ACE/ITDS will be the primary means by which agencies with trade-related responsibilities will receive from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation required for the release of imported cargo and the clearance of cargo for export. These capabilities/mandates fall in line with the DHS mission of Securing and Managing our Borders.

A key goal of ACE is to replace two aging and expensive legacy systems, the Automated Commercial System (ACS) and the Automated Export System (AES). AES has already been successfully retired and it's functionality subsumed by ACE in 2014. ACS will be retired by March 2017. Building ACS functionality into ACE will decrease O&M costs due to ACS retirement.

ACE's key stakeholders are; CBP, Partner Government Agency (PGA) users, and Trade. CBP includes border and trade enforcement personnel who use ACE to process shipments arriving into the US. Trade includes commercial entities that import, ship, insure and provide brokerage services to those importing goods into the US. PGAs include 47 government agencies responsible for the licensing and admissibility of cargo into the U.S.

ACE provides considerable benefits to its stakeholders; such as enhanced targeting of high-risk shipments, automation enabling CBP to process cargo faster (such as reduced primary processing time, which resulted in a savings of $5.4 million) and focus on border security tasks, improved, timely inter-agency information sharing, analysis, and investigation, more efficient workflow and reduction of costly labor and paper intensive activities (such as cost savings to the trade due to reduced border wait times, which resulted in a savings of $15 million in 2014), better reports and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations for Government and private sector, better compliance with legislation requiring greater Government efficiency and effectiveness to better serve the public.",024-043,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","The following is the explanation on ROI as stated in the attached AoA document: 
 
The Return On Investment (ROI) indicates the percent saved in future O&M dollars for every dollar spent on the initial investment. ROI is based on O&M savings in the following areas:  
 -          Help desk support -Application, hardware and software maintenance - 
 -          Data center labor - 
 -          User Training and Materials -Security Testing  
 -          Operational analyses due to lower usage of the mainframe platform  
 -          Efficiencies from the CBP target architecture  
 -          Reduced licensing costs  
 -          Shared system components  
 -          Standardizing certification and accreditation  
 -          Improving scalability and reliability and instituting open standards.  
The benefits of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface will enhance communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade Community. The improved communications will provide time savings for entry corrections and allow for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE) and saving time and money for the government and the Trade Community.

These capabilities have been leveraged and integrated to expand the capabilities to inbound pedestrian, outbound vehicle and pedestrian, and Border Patrol (BP) checkpoint processing; and improve existing primary processing operations.

LBI's goals are to facilitate the flow of travelers into the U.S. in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to Secure and Manage Flows of People and Goods while minimizing disruption and facilitating safe and secure inbound and outbound legal flows of people and goods; increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of land border processing; and integrate data to support intelligence and targeting within the Land Border ""Triangle : inbound, checkpoint, and outbound.

Benefits include: vehicle (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without LBI technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes; reduced manual plate corrections and fewer time and labor intensive secondary referrals. The reduced number of acceptable documents, and increased document security features make it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents.  LBI extended benefits from initial inbound vehicle capabilities by ensuring that vehicle and document data can also be acquired when vehicles leave the U.S. (outbound) or travel within the U.S. interior (Border Patrol checkpoints).  LBI has also extended these benefits to travelers entering the U.S. on foot (pedestrians) and buses.

Key LBI customers include CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and the traveling public.  LBI stakeholders include CBP officers and agents, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State,Mexico and Canada.

The beneficiaries are the traveling public and the governments of Canada, and Mexico and their citizens.

For inbound vehicle and pedestrian processing, RFID technologies, upgraded LPRs, an improved primary inspection application, direction variable message signage, traffic management devices, and policies like active lane management (ALM) expedite border crossing, more efficiently use scarce officer and infrastructure resources.  For example, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options result in more efficient processing methods: vehicles (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without the RFID technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes.  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The benefits that accrue from the technical facilitation (RFID, LPR, VPC) of the crossing process are far reaching: increased throughput per officer, reduced border crossing wait time, and increased capacity to accommodate increases in border crossing volume.  Increased border crossing volume has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.  These capabilities also provide more enhanced information about travelers which improves border crossing security.  LBI 'returns' are calculated based on the difference in wait time prior to LBI compared to post LBI, and by estimating the value of that time for the traveling public.

The 3 phase implementation of SAP was completed in October of 2004. This effort was undertaken as a result of an analysis of legacy Customs Asset Management Processes and replaced numerous legacy financial, procurement, and property systems with a single, fully integrated solution.  SAP provides many benefits to CBP including: complete integration of business processes within one system, improved financial statement reporting and internal controls, reduced cycle-time, elimination of duplicate data entry, improved data accuracy, single system reporting, and enhanced analytical reporting. SAP ensures that CBP is in compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems. The system has dependencies to other CBP systems in the form of interfaces and data transfers that enable the accurate and complete recording of financial and associated transactions. Those systems include Concur Government Edition (CGE), Customs Overtime Scheduling System (COSS), and the CBP Automated Collection System (ACS) to name a few. SAP provides the financial, procurement, and asset tracking which allows CBP to accomplish its mission.  The SAP approach reduces functional gaps identified in past audits and raises performance to acceptable industry benchmarks.  The SAP Project is in a steady - state mode under the Investment Management Process. CBP is now state-of-the-art and has been identified as a leader in Financial Management by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  SAP supports QHSR Mission 2; Secure and Manage our Borders.  The SAP system must be maintained and supported so that CBP financial staff can meet their timelines and efficiency targets which help CBP to operate effectively.  Maintaining SAP will also help CBP continue receiving unqualified audit opinions.  The primary beneficiaries of the system include the over 6000 CBP field and headquarters role-based users as well as CBP and DHS management who utilize the data and information processed and reported on in SAP. Other stakeholders for the SAP program include the Office of Administration and the Office of Information Technology as co-sponsors of the program; as well as others who rely on accurate financial data from CBP.",000-000,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","SAP is an integrated enterprise-wide resource planning (ERP) system that replaced ten stove-piped, outdated, and underperforming mainframe systems that created audit findings of significant internal control weaknesses and were deemed insufficient and no longer suited to meeting data processing and reporting needs.  SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  The elimination of duplicate entry and labor intensive manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  
SAP continues to be a good investment for CBP and the federal government.  In FY2014 with over $12 billion in budgetary resources; CBP collected over $40 billion in revenue and managed $15.9 billion in assets.  As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.

The information is then transmitted to CBP prior to departure. APIS's aligns to the QHSR 2.1 goal to Secure US Air, Land and Sea Boarders and Approaches. APIS reviews passengers and crew to identify possible terrorists or other high-risk individuals. This helps identify threats versus non threats. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, requires commercial air and sea carriers to electronically transmit arrival and departure manifests for each commercial vessel or aircraft prior to arrival at or departure from the US. This includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance.

The ROI estimated in the FY06-FY07 Analysis of Alternatives has been validated in subsequent years.  There might be a slight variation in the ROI over the past several years due to varying acquisition quantities but the benefits are the same, maintaining a stable ROI.  As the program changes scope, or is expanded or enhanced, a new/revised Alternatives Analysis will be conducted and a new ROI calculated. An analysis of inspection technology and protocols in FY11-FY12 showed large-scale technology conducts inspections in an average of 6.7% of the time required for manual inspections. In FY2014, 22.5 million cargo laden conveyances with a market value of $1.1 trillion entered the United States at POE's and their associated crossings and terminals. Of the 22.5 million cargo conveyances, NII examined 7.2 cargo trucks and sea containers, of these examinations, over 2.3 million inspections were for cargo truck and seaport containers using imaging technology. Without using NII technology the same number of exams would have required approximately 9,000 additional CBP Officers.   
  
Small-scale technology analysis shows similar efficiencies. The number of inspections per year and the cost for them was calculated for manual inspections and for technology use. The speed, accuracy, and cost of the inspections used in the ROI calculations also included the external benefits to commerce. This was measured in terms of the costs for waiting times. Inspection technology accelerates the movement of legitimate trade and travel by reducing the time to conduct cargo and commercial vehicle examination.   
  
The greatest qualitative benefits of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism. The increased number and the improved quality of cargo inspections will decrease the probability that WMD or other articles or instruments of terrorism will enter the United States.

ATS uses intelligence info and technology to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for exams and passengers for inspection. ATS allows CBP officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers consistent with current threats. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of a passengers, import, or export in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subject to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analyses, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public. ATS provides selectivity and target capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. As volumes of data increase in people, cargo, and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to more relevant real-time info on which to base critical admission decisions.  The ATS systems address data quality improvements to ensure efforts are focused on only those persons and cargo that present most probable threats to the homeland.  The beneficiaries and key customers of ATS are: CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP Office of International Trade, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Public. Stakeholders include: DHS/CBP (OFO and OIT). ATS utilizes information received from TECS, APIS, and other systems identified in the Enterprise Architecture tab. ATS analyzes over 17M transactions per day.  Total ATS passengers and cargo systems maintain 99% uptimes.  Additionally, ATS scans over 150 million Air, Ocean, Rail, Truck, and Auto shipments for potential threats.

ATS has no DME funding and has been operational since 2004. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo. Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts. 
 
ATS benefits can be described through the# of persons denied boarding pre-departure 3,149 from October 2014 - March 2015 and cargo that is not allowed into the U.S. Another example is the SAS model within ATS which captured over $69.747 million dollars (street value) worth of Cocaine, Heroin, Meth, and Marijuana from October 2014 - June 2015.

TECS supports over 70,000 users representing over 20 Federal agencies responsible for traveler processing, investigations, vetting, entry/exit, and research. ICE has a separate but coordinated TECS Mod program. Each agency is modernizing and enhancing the parts of TECS that support their unique missions.

CBP TECS Mod supports the DHS and CBP missions by protecting the nation from the entry of dangerous or illegal people, ensuring efficient flow of lawful people crossing US borders and enabling effective decision making through rigorous screening of travelers to provide improved intelligence and information sharing. It has reduced the possibility of missing someone who should have been intercepted by data integration and search capabilities, improved access to person-centric information, allowed person data to be re-queried upon inspection at Air/Sea Primary and improved the effectiveness and efficiency of secondary inspections by sending data from the primary to the secondary application upon referral, ensuring integration from primary to secondary.  The forgoing directly addresses the provisions of sections 201 through 203 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.

Block 1 supports U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents and officers to effectively detect, identify, classify and resolve illegal incursions at the border. The goal of the Block 1 System is to provide USBP with the ability to detect, identify, and classify incursions at the border.
 
The Block 1 system provides improved safety benefits to the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) with better tactical advantages through: over watch capabilities which use geo-positioning information with visual verification of agent locations relative to threats; better geo-synchronization actions for risk reduction through the use of landmarks and terrain references on the COP; geo-spatial tracking; visual verification; real time information on specific threats; and increased visual coverage through the use of sensors.  
  
The system provides technological tools throughout CBP, but specifically allows Border Patrol to focus efforts in areas other than Tucson and AJO, Arizona. This provides flexibility in deploying resources and personnel throughout the central and eastern Arizona region. The system has improved situational awareness of illegal cross-border activity, leading to increased narcotic seizures and apprehensions of undocumented aliens. There were approximately 2,338 Apprehensions and approximately 152, 204 pounds of marijuana seizures from Mar 2014 to Mar 2015.

Moreover, prior to the Block 1 system deployment, USBP did not possess a capability to accurately determine the amount of illegal traffic in the area currently covered by the Block 1 system. The ROI calculation shows -90% for the expected useful life of the Block 1 system. 

Compared to the baseline operating costs from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the operating costs for Block 1 system are estimated to be considerably lower. ROI was calculated by (Operating Costs without Block 1 - Operating Costs with Block 1) divided by the Capital Investment costs, providing the same level of surveillance. The internal benefit of improved situational awareness on the Arizona border has increased USBP's ability to execute its mission elements and processes. These elements/processes include: predict, deter, detect, identify, classify, track, respond, and resolve. The Block 1 system integrates multiple sensor outputs into one COP and provides USBP with persistent coverage within the Block 1 sensor viewsheds (see definition - Supporting Comments). In addition, these sensors are able to provide USBP Agents with an increased visual coverage area and more opportunities for early identification and classification.

Benefits include mission efficiency and effectiveness, as well as Border Patrol safety. More specifically, the IFT system provides the Border Patrol the capability of continuously detecting Items of Interest (IoIs) from a tested range of 6.2 miles and identifying/classifying each from a tested range of 5 miles from each fixed tower within a Border Patrol Station's Area of Coverage (AoC), and provides the Common Operating Picture (COP) operator(s) at the Border Patrol Station Command and Control Center with near real-time video of operator-selected IoIs of sufficient quality to enable a trained operator to identify and classify the IoI. IoI data from one or more IFT units across the AoC will be shown geospatially on one or more COP workstations that also display the video of operator-selected IoIs. This will allow the COP operator to track and communicate the location and number of IoIs to Border Patrol Agents in the field, thus allowing the USBP to monitor an Area of Interest (AoI) with fewer agents and equipment resources.

This allows CBP to adjust the location of its surveillance capabilities to keep pace with the ever changing border threat. The MSC consists of the outfitting of trucks with an array of sophisticated radar and sensing devices that aids Border Patrol (BP) agents in the detection of illegal border crossings. The MSC is an integrated suite of sensor equipment attached to the flat skid cargo bed of a Government-furnished Ford F-450 truck, with an operator workstation located inside the truck cabin.

These goals supports Mission 2 of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR): ""Secure and Manage our Borders"". More specifically, the MSC Program addresses Goal 2.1: ""Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches."" 

Benefits of the MSC include: 1) Identifying and tracking of numerous IOI's over a large area, the MSC allows for greater surveillance coverage then possible with an agent on foot. 2) Enhances BP Agent safety by providing advanced warning of not only the existence of IOI's but the nature of that threat including whether the individuals are armed. 3) The abilities of the MSC also allow for greater response coordination thereby improving the likelihood of a successful law enforcement resolution as well as officer safety. Radar capabilities are responsible for two significant benefits over a camera only system: advanced warning of the existence of IOIs, and can allow for tracking of numerous IOI's over a larger area.

Nonetheless, an ROI calculation was developed based on operating assumptions (i.e., status quo of an average of one Border Patrol agent per mile of border versus 12 full-time MSCs). The ROI is developed by calculating the Base Case Operations and Maintenance (O&M) minus the New Program O&M (plus other benefits) and then dividing the value by the Planning, Initial Capital, and Non-Recurring (i.e., new program non-O&M or new investment) costs and then subtracting 1.

The purpose of the investment is to increase the probability of apprehension in an effort to reduce cross border crime. Internal benefits are the increased probability of detection which increases the costs of attempting to enter the U.S. illegally, thereby reducing the illicit flows and crimes associated with smuggling at and between the ports of entry in AZ.  U.S. border threats are opportunistic, adaptive and continuously probing to exploit any new or existing weaknesses observed, and they have near real-time situational awareness of USBP activities through the use of a vast network of scouts on both sides of the border. For some locations, MSC systems are more effective systems than fixed tower infrastructure. MSC systems, with their mobile capabilities, can respond to threats in multiple areas, and can be fielded in the areas with the highest threats.  A more mobile response capability allows more flexibility and adjustment to changes in IOI patterns. MSC systems can be used to augment existing systems or substitute for currently deployed technology temporarily non-operational. External benefits include benefits related to the deterrence effect of a deployed MSC.

This goal of this investment is to continue to operate and maintain the Northern Border Remote Video Surveillance System (NB RVSS) located in Buffalo, NY and Detroit, MI. The NB RVSS towers have expanded the coverage on the northern border where high threat areas exist. The NB RVSS supports the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review by specifically supporting the security mission to Secure and Manage Our Borders. The NB RVSS systems support the DHS mission to improve upon border security, to exclude terrorist threats, drug traffickers, and other threats to national security, economic security, and public safety. The goal of the NB RVSS program is to provide persistent ground and maritime surveillance needed by Border Patrol agents to effectively deter, detect, track, identify, classify, and respond to items of interest throughout the respective Area of Responsibility (AOR).  

The deployed system covers over 50 miles of maritime border with the RVSS capability. Operating and maintaining the NB RVSS towers provides the financial savings of not having to commit hundreds of agents to support the mission. The deployed systems serve as force multipliers enabling CBP officers to effectively monitor the vast and complex border.

To further define the basis for the ROI, an ROI document was developed and available upon request. Based on a value of 2,200 Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) and 4,000 miles of border there are an average of 0.55 agents per mile of border.  Note that not all of these agents are on the border providing surveillance.  They perform a variety of tasks. For the Base Case, we are assuming that persistent surveillance (i.e., 24 hours per day and 365 days per year) is required and consists of 0.55 agents per mile of border.  The value of 0.55 agents per mile as an average was selected even though multiple shifts are required and not all current agents provide surveillance support at all times.  That is, this section of the border is assumed to be more active and require more agents than the average stretch of border.  The border is assumed to be limited to the section along which the Northern Border RVSS project would operate (i.e., 50 miles).  One truck is assumed to be provided per every four agents for transportation to and from the Border Patrol Stations (BPSs).  An average round trip travel distance for each truck was assumed to be 80 miles per shift with 3 shifts per day.

TARS provides surveillance data to the CBP Office of Air and Marine (OAM) Operations Center (AMOC). TARS is an aerostat-borne surveillance system that is utilized by CBP's Air & Marine branch as its primary tool to identify and track suspect targets. Radar information from TARS is distributed to multiple operations centers run by CBP, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and DOD. As a secondary mission, TARS supports the United States Northern Command's (USNORTHCOM's) and the United States Southern Command's (USSOUTHCOM's) air surveillance mission. In addition, TARS surveillance data also supports North American Aerospace Defense Command's (NORAD's) air sovereignty mission for the Continental United States (CONUS).

TARS' strategic goal is to support the DHS QHSR mission 2, Secure and Manage Our Borders. TARS also strives to assist CBP to consistently detect, identify and classify illegal entries and determine the level of threat involved. 

TARS' benefits include a unique look-down radar capability that allows CBP to detect aircraft that would not be detected through a ground based system due to its low altitude and/or terrain masking limitations. While operating at 10,000 feet, the TARS radar has been optimized to detect low (0 - 2,000 feet above sea level) and slow (0 - 1,000 knots) aircraft at a range of 200 nautical miles.

TARS' primary customers are CBP's Air Marine Operations Center (AMOC) and CBP's Caribbean Air Marine Operation Center (CAMOC).

ADIS benefits to the government and stakeholders include assistance in determining admissibility, law enforcement action, Visa approval/denial and Visa Waiver Program eligibility. The investment benefits users by matching travel events with changes in immigration status to provide an overstay status. Benefits also include support for anticipated immigration reform and expansion of biographic and biometric exit activities. ADIS looks at arrival and departure data collectively from multiple sources to determine whether a person departed the US on time or if they legally extended their immigration status. Overstays are divided into 2 categories: (1) in-country overstays (ICO), meaning an individual overstayed and is still thought to be in the US, and; (2) out-of-country overstays (OCO), meaning an individual left the country, but overstayed the period of admission before departing.

Because it will only recover its costs through operations, it will not generate any return on investment.  Before the implementation of TRIRIGA, CBP FM&E did not possess a tool to accurately record all of CBP's facilities, to include the capabilities of conducting assessments.  There were multiple, disparate systems collecting data on facilities, assessments, and projects.  TRIRIGA addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  Continuous improvements to the federal reporting capabilities of TRIRIGA enable FM&E to more effectively and efficiently provide facilities portfolio information to DHS.  
 
The implementation of TRIRIGA has provided many benefits to Facilities Management & Engineering (FM&E).  Now in its third year, not only does TRIRIGA provide the source data for CBP reporting to the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) and DHS's Real Property Data Warehouse (DHS-RPDW), it also provides the critical facilities data for CBP's geospatial information systems and improved processes for managing operation and maintenance.  Before TRIRIGA, there was not a single source for facilities condition assessments (FCAs) or the facilities condition index (FCI), which provides an overall snapshot of the health of CBP facilities.  As the agency moves towards maintenance of the existing portfolio, and less new construction, the FCI will be critical in determining required funding, as well as prioritizing need.
 
Although there are limited data points, TRIRIGA is generally well-received by the user community, as is demonstrated by the results of two annual user satisfaction surveys.  Our target satisfaction is 4.00 (out of 5), or 80%.  While we have yet to meet that target, we have increased from 63% (3.15) to 65% (3.25).

CBP Mobile goals are to procure and deploy mobile technology to frontline personnel in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to secure U.S. air, land and sea borders and approaches and prevent terrorist attacks.  

Some benefits include: Vehicle environment - mobile devices have led directly to over 1000 successful CBP enforcement actions by OFO and OBP, including identification of subjects of NCIC warrants, and the interdiction of undocumented aliens, narcotics interdiction, unreported currency and weapons violations. Rail environment - mobile devices are used for on-board pre-inspection clearance for passengers and crewmembers.  Seaport environment - mobile devices are used to process passenger/crewmembers.  Cargo environment - Agriculture Specialists with mobile inspection processing capability have immediate access to the applications, databases and reference material which enable real-time query, processing and verification capability.  Outbound land environment mobile devices provide valuable intelligence, enhance partnerships and assist with firearms and currency outbound interdiction operations. CBP Mobile plans to extend similar benefits across all CBP operational components. 

The mission outcome is meeting the need to add mobility through the provision of technology which enables officers, agents and specialists to perform inspections of travelers and cargo, and identify and process undocumented aliens to improve security and enhance intelligence gathering in all locations.

Expected benefits are: 
 -         Mobile devices will improve cargo processing (inbound and outbound) in all modes; mobile devices will revolutionize the cargo release and agricultural inspection processes in particular. 
 -         Mobile devices will have a positive effect on passenger processing and will greatly improve sea passenger/crew admissibility processing.  Streamlining passenger processing in all mission areas without compromising security, officer or traveler safety results elevated public confidence in CBP professionalism and effectiveness.  
 -         Mobile devices mean real-time information availability in field environments which  increases officer/agents' safety and ability to interdict criminals
 -         Mobile devices will have the greatest impact where port facilities and inspection areas cover wide geographic spaces that currently require CBP officers to cover considerable distances to reach fixed workstations to access or enter data.  Releasing travelers and cargo without having to return to a fixed location enables officers/agents/specialists to spend more time conducting inspections/examinations and results in reduced overtime requirements to complete paperwork.  
 -         Mobile devices will positively impact the trade community by facilitating and shortening the hold time on commodities entering the country.

BSDP is a mission critical tool that CBP has relied on to sustain officer and agent safety, and integrity, while also ensuring border security within and around all LPOEs. 
     
The goal for BSDP is to achieve more efficient and effective use of CBP resources and personnel, improved operational controland situation awareness, increased contraband seizures, enhanced CBP personnel safety and security and reinforced CBP personnel integrity.

BSDP quantitative benefits include the cost avoidance for officers, agents or guards not needed to provide persistent surveillance at and around LPOEs on a 24/7/365 basis. The cost avoidance was estimated at $94M/year. Qualitative benefits include: increased CBP personnel safety at LPOEs, improved emergency response times at LPOEs, reinforced CBP personnel integrity, reduced risk of CBP exposure to unsubstantiated claims at LPOEs, reduced burden on the public due to more efficient processing at LPOEs, increased efficiency and effective use of CBP resources and personnel at LPOEs, increased contraband seizures at all LPOEs, increased border security and control, improved flow of legitimate trade/travel at all LPOEs, enhanced situational awareness at LPOEs, improved officer safety in and around LPOEs, enhances visibility into the security and operational integrity at LPOEs, remote monitoring capabilities for automated border crossings, surveillance recordings used for evidence to support prosecution of criminal activity and officer integrity investigations.

During the development of the 2014 Operational Analysis (OA), the BSDP CBA was updated and compared against the financial projection estimated in the 2004 CBA. In the original CBA, BSDP was expected to provide a ROI of 589% by the year 2011. Two updated Return on Investment (ROI) scenarios were developed for the 2014 OA and in both cases the original external benefits were EXCLUDED from the calculation leaving only internal the cost avoidance benefit (reduced need for additional officers or overtime pay). The external benefit from 2004 was based on the benefit of preventing a terrorist attack on the order of 9/11 which is extremely sensitive to the probability of occurrence. In the first case described in the OA (Case 1), the benefit calculation was applied against the projected deployment scale used in the 2004 analysis. The second case (Case 2) measures the ROI against the actual deployment that occurred providing a more realistic assessment of the benefits derived and ROI achieved. (actual LPOEs and other locations utilizing BSDP). In both of the 2014 OA scenarios, the same actual costs were applied to the calculation. The result of the ROI update using actual costs showed that between 2004- 2011 BSDP ROI resulted in 479% for Case 1 (original deployment plan), and 745% for Case 2 (today's actual deployment).

BPES' objective is to help meet the DHS, CBP, and USBP mission of protecting the U.S. from various 21st century threats and adversaries by enabling capabilities that address challenges in data management, threat response, and resource support through the use of select technologies. 
Primary benefits of BPES are: 1) Improved Information Sharing and Management-enables the automatic collection, dissemination and analysis of critical asset and personnel data, improving USBP's situational awareness and risk-based decision making process. This data is used to make better informed resource decisions. 2) Improved System and Process Integration-supports new innovative approaches to exchanging information and the integration of USBP technology. These efforts help USBP develop efficient day-to-day processes for agents, and reduce operational costs by providing timely information across various CBP systems. 3) Rapid Response Ability-enables USBP to gain greater situational awareness (through ground/geospatial sensors along the border) to support rapid response in investigating potential threats.

It is a cost efficient and effective investment that meets business owner expectations and is in alignment with USCG/DHS and USPHS/HHS mission and vision.   Provides HR and payroll services to two non-DoD uniformed services - NOAA CC and USPHS CC.  All three services follow HR and payroll requirements as mandated by the annual National Defense Authorization act and Direct Access fulfills those requirements for the three services   
Goals:  Maintain state of the art HR and Payroll applications that are reliable, sustainable and secure; meet the business & mission requirements; sustain HR and payroll functions; andprovide cost-effective, dependable, and accurate HR and payroll data used by CG and PHS for mission execution planning   
Benefits:  Consolidated 5 CG HR and payroll applications and 6 PHS HR applications. It includes the legacy JUMPS payroll system, in process of being decommissioned. USPHS will gain new functions that will help it manage its workforce and improve accountability and efficiency in support of its missions.   On 4/1/08 the USCG Retiree and Annuitant payroll processing system was formally migrated from a legacy, custom built, mainframe based system, into the Direct Access application. In 4QFY07, USPHS CC was directed by OMB to investigate the USCG's success in implementing a commercial HR and Payroll product.   This demonstrates that the USCG is a Center of Excellence as a provider of outsourced Military HR services.   The Corps anticipates significant cost savings once it completes the migration.

It is a cost effective O&M IT investment that exceeds business owner expectations. As evidenced by the data below, the Direct Access investment continues to prove to be extremely beneficial for stakeholders both internal and external to USCG. The migration of each of the systems into Direct Access has resulted in over $4M in annual cost savings in terms of hardware, software, and administrative support. The system pays huge dividends by integrating all aspects of HR to allow for a true Talent Management System. Through integrating PeopleSoft's payroll system, Global Pay, lines of accounting controls have been greatly enhanced for Active Duty and Reserve personnel. It ensures improved and accurate lines of accounting in Direct Access, which has allowed USCG's Pay and Personnel Center (PPC) to discontinue two backend manual accounting processes.
 
External benefits have increased with this consolidation in that users can access a single payroll application in one place. Additionally, prior to Direct Access, the Service Personnel Office (SPO) had to process every individual leave transaction manually.  Through the functionality of Absence Requests, the number of requests to be manually processed by SPO was reduced by 260,000 annually. This translates into eliminating approximately 13,500 man-hours of data entry work, a total cost savings of $548,166 per year.

The investment is contributing in a positive manner by better locating mariners in distress & saving lives & property at sea by providing increased communications coverage and incorporating advanced Direction Finding (DF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) radio Digital Selective Calling (DSC) capabilities.   R21 significantly increases the ability to detect and respond to marine distress calls in the coastal zone, resulting in marine safety benefits to all stakeholders (Internal/External); U.S. public, CG operators, boating public, DHS Undersecretary for Management, U.S. Congress, & other federal, state & local maritime operators, emergency response & law enforcement units/agencies are the key customers and significant beneficiaries of this system. 

Benefits/Stakeholders:The Program stakeholders include Coast Guard operators, the boating public, DHS Undersecretary for Management, the U.S. Congress, and other federal, state and local maritime operators, emergency response and law enforcement units/agencies.  As of June 2015, the deployed R21 system has supported over 80,000 Search and R21 cases and has allowed the nation to fulfill Global Maritime Distress and Safety System requirements.
 
As of June 30, 2015, the R21 system is deployed and operational over approximately 260,000 square miles of coverage in 32 of 37 Coast Guard Sectors, which were delivered by the prime contractor.  The Coast Guard is the lead system integrator for the remaining 5 sectors (Western Rivers and Alaska).  
 
R21 Coastal has completed gapfiller sites (prioritized critical coastal waterways that did not have adequate communication coverage with the full rate production group of RFFs ); R21 is not installing anymore VSAT or 3G/4G equipment for coastal sites. Remainder of sites are being installed with OE funds.; Continue system implementation in 3 Western Rivers Sectors & 2 Alaska Sectors, including new remote radio communication consoles, DSC capability and 6 new RFFs (3 in WR/3 in AK); Continue system testing  and deployments; Transition to full sustainment operations.",024-036,"46751 - Enhance Disaster Preparedness and Response","The R21 Return on Investment (ROI) was determined by a Cost Analysis dtd March 2005; the cost analysis demonstrated a ROI of 3.05 and a payback period of 13 years. In determining the ROI, the R21 Key Decision Point (KDP) 1 was completed in Jul 1995 and authorized entry into the program's Concept and Technology Demonstration phase under the authority of DOT. In Aug 1999, KDP2 authorized the program to proceed into the Capability Development and Demonstration phase. In Aug 2001, the Coast Guard awarded three R21 Phase I contracts to competing contractors to develop proposed system designs. The Phase I proposals were reviewed in late 2001 and the Phase II production contract RFP was issued in Feb 2002. Following a formal source selection process, the USCG's Source Selection Official (SSO) awarded the R21 Phase II production contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems in Sep 2002. In Jul 2005, DHS authorized the R21 program to proceed into the Production and Deployment phase and full rate production subsequently commenced in Sep 2005.

Internal Benefits: R21 is used to tailor CG response (including coordinating with local first responders and federal coordinators), significantly reducing response time to mariners in distress. The R21 system enhances the CG's ability to detect & respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. public's marine safety & saves lives. Benefits also include system disaster recovery capabilities that have supported coordination in numerous federals regional response and remediation efforts by providing a critical communication backbone in the disaster regions. For example, the R21 system provided a communication system that supported efforts to re-open ports in NY and NJ after hurricane Sandy.

External Benefits of the R21 system: Provides capabilities to help ensure the successful outcome of Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. To date, R21 has been used in more than 79,000 SAR cases. Advanced DF which moreaccurately identifies the location of callers with lines of bearing to the VHF radio transmission source which reduces response time & search area; Continuous, enhanced VHF-FM marine radio coverage out to 20 nautical miles from shore; improved ability to identify suspected hoax calls; Increases the number of voice channels; Digital voice recording w/ immediate playback; Timely flow of info between CG & other stakeholders.

ALMIS is a centralized system that captures programmatic information that is used at all levels of the Coast Guard.
 
The goal is to align ourselves with the Commandant's direction to protect those on the sea and protect the nation from threats delivered by the sea and protect the sea itself by providing mission ready crews and assets and to support ALMIS users with system availability of 98% or better.  
 
ALMIS benefits our 22,000 customers and stakeholders by providing an electronic system which is reliable, ensures safe and mission ready assets, captures mission events accurately, is user friendly, and provides total asset status visibility.  ALMIS provides operational oversight capability for mission scheduling and execution. ALMIS benefits operational leadership by providing the tools to maintain OPCON/TACON oversight of our missions and assets. ALMIS directly supports our aviation and naval units to include 325 aircraft, 1,618 Small Boats, 166 Cutters and 109 DGPS Towers. ALMIS benefits also include the metrics and statistics to support HQ operational budgetary requirements.
 
ALMIS contributes to Coast Guard mission delivery by supporting data entry from the start of an operational mission, recording the mission execution and tracking crew competencies and proficiency. The system maintains aircraft and naval asset maintenance along with standardization, supply, part replacements, and warehouse activities in order to provide safe and mission ready assets.  ALMIS supports core financial procurement actions, and the reconciliation necessary for current business processes. ALMIS contributes to the four key components of the circle of logistics, which are: mission, configuration, maintenance, and supply.
 
The key customers of ALMIS are the Configuration Control Board (CCB) membership representing the logistics centers, operational leadership and those providing the actual asset logistics support.

Return on Investment is a performance measure which evaluates the gain from investment divided by the cost.In our organization this return on investment is measured by meeting the key goals and missions of the Coast Guard which ALMIS directly supports.  
 
The benefits from aviation are reflected in the following highlights:  The Coast Guard responded to over 39,000 potential cases, benefiting the public by saving more than 3,00 lives in FY14.  Additionally there were over 6,000 sorties supporting Living Marine Resources, 3,300 sorties for Drug Interdiction and 1,900 Migrant Interdiction sorties that directly benefit all citizens. Coast Guard aviations' 325 aircraft and their crews played a significant part in these accomplishments.  ALC's unwavering air station support ensured the operational unit readiness, measured by operational availability met the needs of the public.  The benefit of Coast Guard mission success is the result of key operational/engineering support and documentation systems which ALMIS provides.  ALMIS is the foundation for mission scheduling, asset permission and servicing, mission records, documentation of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, asset configuration, maintenance due lists to maintain all operational assets, key financial and supply support systems which when combined, keep our asset availability rate so high.  
 
ALC continues to add both vessels and aircraft into ALMIS and is becoming the asset status system of record for most of the Coast Guard.  In 2013, ALC added the large cutters into ALMIS, achieving total asset visibility. This benefited the SFLC by increasing visibility over fleet maintenance.  SFLC has enrolled 166 cutters into ALMIS.  ALMIS also benefits the surface fleet by providing reports for the status of over 1,618 small boats.

NAIS is a data collection, processing and distribution system that provides international Maritime Organization (IMO)-adopted Automatic Identification System (AIS) information to enhance safety of navigation and our Marine Transportation System (MTS), and improve Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The project provides the necessary capability to ensure the effective exchange of information  between AIS-equipped vessels, aircraft, ATON, and shore stations within all major U.S. ports, waterways, and coastal zones.  It integrates a network of AIS receivers and transmitters, data processing and storage centers, and user interface services that capture, exchange, and analyze data of critical interest for maritime safety and security.  Data collected supports the nation's maritime interest, from the safety of vessels and ports through collision avoidance, to the safety of the nation through detection, traffic identification, and classification of vessels.
Benefits/Stakeholders:
The data collected by NAIS will be shared with other pertinent stakeholders and decision makers in support of maritime security at critical ports.  NAIS supports a layered defense and requirements for Advanced Notice of Arrival by correlating AIS data with target vessel reporting and other maritime awareness data to focus resources on higher interest vessels.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of NAIS include: USCG, CBP, Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, indirectly to the international community through MSSIS, and port partners.  Maritime Operational Threat Response benefits in achieving a coordinated U.S. Government response to threats to the US in the maritime domain.  NAIS will facilitate the Coast Guard response to threats in the maritime domain by enabling better visibility of suspect vessels as well as other vessels in the vicinity.  NAIS will allow for visibility and tracking of U.S. Government vessel assets for improved overall coordination of resources.  Maritime Communications benefits are associated with improved USCG ability to communicate with vessels in support of various USCG missions.  These benefits include the enhanced exchange of navigation information, improved communications interoperability with foreign vessels and other Government agencies' vessels, and backup capability to the Rescue 21 voice systems via AIS messaging.

The ROI of 7.94, as calculated in the NAIS Alternatives Analysis of Dec 29, 2006, was calculated by determining the sum of the present value of all benefits and dividing it by the sum of the present value of all costs of each capability.  The benefits of security risk reduction (such as detection of large commercial vessel introduces WMD into US port and fishing vessel has a crew member onboard suspected of being a terrorist) are included in the ROI calculation.  The benefits of operational performance (such as improved Search and Rescue detection and response and collision detection and enforcement) have not been included because the confidence in those calculations was low; however if they were to be included, the ROI would be even higher.  The benefits were calculated for the following capabilities provided by NAIS: coastal receive, coastal transmit, long range receive, advanced data capability, and inland waters receive and transmit.  For each capability a variety of scenarios were evaluated using probabilities of occurrence and consequence costs to demonstrate the improvement in security risk by implementing NAIS.

There are approximately 2389 VLS users. During a normal business day, VLS has approximately 755 concurrent users, and approximately 14,000 logins per quarter. Per ALCOAST 620/05 the Coast Guard is transforming/aligning our business processes for logistics. Logistics will use a single set of business processes modeled after the Aviation BPM. 

Goals: Short term goals for VLS are focused on 2 objectives: (1) to ensure VLS can support the aforementioned single set of business processes, and (2) to ensure the sustainability of VLS from a technical standpoint until it is replaced by the Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS). VLS components are presently undergoing a technical refresh to support these goals.
 
VLS consists of Fleet Logistics System (FLS), Configuration Management Plus (CMPlus), and Naval and Electronics Supply Support System (NESSS). FLS provides an integrated logistics system for configuration management, financial and procurement management, supply support, maintenance and supply data for over 240 cutters and over 1000 standard boats.  CMPlus feeds configuration, maintenance and supply data to FLS. FLS uses the data from CMPlus for decision-making to support logistics. FLS provides NESSS with historical and future supply data via the maintenance information captured in CMPlus and FLS. NESSS provides supply data for use by FLS. NESSS supports all supply activities needed for the naval and electronics program. NESSS supports the financial management system for the Coast Guard Yard. FLS feeds CMPlus with new updated configuration, maintenance and supply data. CMPlus and FLS enable field units to create and send MILSTRIP requisition transactions and generate obligation accounting data.

The tech refresh of VLS, currently in the implementation phase, will enable the VLS to support modernized business processes for the CG surface logistics community, while affording the opportunity to improve data quality in the transition. VLS continues to provide a suite of logistics tools for the surface community that is evolving to support modernized Coast Guard business processes, on a new IT foundation that supports modular development, and from a suite with only half the number of applications, which drives down indirect costs of the program. This, in turn, will better support the Coast Guard while VLS is operational, and also during the transition to CG-LIMS. Components of VLS have been in operation for almost 20 years.  Initial ROI for VLS was realized well before the 7 year mark.  
The VLS tech refresh is expected to be completed by the end of 4th Qtr FY15.  After the completion of the project and staffing is at final allocation, return on investment will be realized in 2.5 years. Savings will be realized in certification and accreditation (due to only two systems requiring C&A after the refresh.

The program acquires and implements the C4ISR capabilities mandated by the ORD to improve the USCG response to emerging threats and hazards within the maritime domain. C4ISR mission needs, threats and gaps described in the 2004 Deepwater Mission Need Statement (MNS) were validated in a 2009 C4ISR MNS and remain valid. C4ISR concerns extend beyond deepwater regions to wherever Coast Guard assets are relied upon to support the service's enduring roles of Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship. To effectively respond to the threats facing our maritime region, the C4ISR modernization program will focus on the following priorities: Functionality: Obtain core C4ISR for air, surface, intelligence and shore; Interoperability: Transition from proprietary to government to open solutions; Implementation: Net-centric design, initial asset installs and upgrades and back-fits; Supportability: Lab infrastructure that supports the Government's role as system integrator and keeps pace with constantly evolving information technology demands and standard changes; Sustainment: Technology development and upgrades that reduce O&M costs. 

Stakeholders include DHS, DoD, CG operators, Sponsor (CG-7), and Technical Authority (CG-6). 

The program has completed delivery of baseline C4ISR capability (Increment 1), as well as the federated CGC2 baseline (Segment 2), to 25 aviation assets (8 LRS, 17 MRS).

Through the replacement of many existing, resource-intensive logistics systems with one centrally-managed, integrated system, CG-LIMS provides significant cost savings in the IT application alone.  
The system has the ability to fully trace financial obligations, asset valuations, and overall CFO Act and FFMIA compliance which is a high priority for the Coast Guard. An integrated, centrally-managed logistics system, properly integrated with the Core Accounting System at the transaction level of detail, enables accountable tracking of financial transactions throughout the organization, in lieu of the current stove-piped processes that make the task manpower-intensive and overwhelming.  
Current legacy logistics IT investments in the Coast Guard will be targeted for consolidation and replacement by CG-LIMS. Capability required for each stove-piped community will be fully considered in the requirements phase of this investment.   
The Coast Guard's financial transformation and progress toward compliance with the CFO Act and FFMIA is enhanced by the transparency of logistics systems and ability to interface with relevant information managed within them. Investing in a centrally-managed, integrated logistics system allows the Coast Guard to provide timely and consistent data to the Coast Guard's Core Accounting System.

Each sector has, on average, 3 shifts of 3 WatchStanders. The use of the WatchKeeper system has reduced the need to log into several other systems, thus saving approximately 30 minutes of time per WatchStander per day. 

Therefore, current annual return on investment (ROI) from a purely manpower standpoint is 37 Sectors X 365 days X 3 shifts X 3 WatchStanders X  1/2 man hours saved per day = 60,772.50 man hours saved annually. 
These man hours can be spent on other IOC activities, further reducing staffing needs at each Sector while improving the effectiveness of the WatchStander. 

The use of the WatchKeeper system benefits other organizations by proving them with an integrated view and consolidation of multiple system interfaces into one system and eliminates the need for them to build and maintain similar systems providing WatchKeeper functions. Overall, while the investment is providing value to the users, the Program Office continues to explore cost effective alternatives and opportunities for convergence.

PAWSS is a part of the Vessel Traffic Services program, and is one of several systems used for this program. The PAWSS was Congressionally Mandated to modernize Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) in five ports (New York (NY). Houston/Galveston (HG), San Francisco (SF), Prince William Sound (PWS), and Puget Sound (PS)) and introduce automated VTS systems in four other ports (Lower Mississippi River (LMR), Sault Ste. Marie (SSM) Berwick Bay (BB), and Port Arthur (PA)) through the use of commercially available technology including Automatic Identification System (AIS), Radars, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), and voice communications.

Benefits
 
PAWSS is a Vessel Traffic Service navigation information system that is based on commercial off-the-shelf products consisting of sensors, communications, and decision support equipment. PAWSS automates several processes for the Vessel Traffic Services Program and allows watchstanders to focus more on evaluating the traffic picture. PAWSS is deployed in a number of coastal locations throughout the U.S. and allows the Coast Guard to propagate important navigation information to mariners, thereby reducing collisions, groundings, and facilitates the safe and efficient transit of vessel traffic. The system compresses radar, VHF-FM voice, AIS, and video from remote sites into commercial leased landlines or microwaves and sends the information to a central VTS (Vessel Traffic Center). The vessel data is processed and displayed in a graphical interface, chart based format that leads itself to early recognition of potentially dangerous situations. A minimum of twelve months of vessel transit data is stored in an Oracle database for later reconstructing collisions, spills or other incidences. Additionally, the historical data facilitates data mining to analyze potential trends, such as, traffic density, port tonnage and fulfilling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. PAWSS utilizes Commercial off the Shelf (COTS)software and hardware. The core component of the PAWSS is based upon the proprietary Lockheed Martin MTM-200 Software Architecture.

The goal is to provide an affordable, standard, an approved network at the Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) level. The network will provide a means for mission critical data exchange between Coast Guard members, contractors, port partners and other federal/states agencies that work with the Coast Guard.  The network is a critical tool used by the Coast Guard to communicate and achieve success in Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship.  
 
Benefits: Currently, CG One meets DHS mandates to use one network under DHS in order to improve management and security of the network.  The Coast Guard uses the network services provided by DHS under the Infrastructure Transformation Program (ITP) Working Capital Fund (WCF).  This solution allows the Coast Guard to meet requirements for department-wide information sharing and to consolidate its Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) networks into one department-wide network called OneNet; while sustaining the ability to connect with DOD computer networks (NIPRNET). The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency is responsible for DHS's OneNet network infrastructure under the ITP plan.

NCPS consists of the hardware, software, supporting processes, training, and services that are being developed and acquired to support the Department's mission requirements as delineated in the CNCI and mandated in NSPD-54/ HSPD-23.  NCPS provides a wide range of cyber security capabilities for the Federal Executive Branch government networks (.gov domain), including:  intrusion detection (passive defense); intrusion prevention (active defense); advanced cyber analytics - such as data aggregation & correlation, visualization, malware analysis, and packet capture; incident management; and information sharing and collaboration. NCPS aligns with three missions in the 2014 DHS QHSR: 1. Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security; 4. Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace; and 5. Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience. NCPS contributes to Terrorism Prevention as cyber-terrorism becomes intertwined with cybercrime and state-sponsored activity. NCPS also supports efforts to strengthen and safeguard national infrastructure. NCPS aligns most directly with the Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace mission, and it supports all four goals of the 2014 QHSR: 4.1 Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure; 4.2 Secure the Federal Civilian Government Information Technology Enterprise; 4.3 Advance Law Enforcement, Incident Response, and Reporting Capabilities, and 4.4 Strengthen the Ecosystem.

Under this program, DHS centrally oversees the procurement and operations of diagnostic sensors (tools) and dashboards deployed to each participating agency. Using input from the sensors and agency-level dashboards, officials at each agency will be able to quickly identify which network problems to fix first, and empower technical managers to prioritize and mitigate risks on their respective networks. In addition, DHS will maintain a dashboard to provide situational awareness on a federal level. For those agencies that require additional support, contractors have been approved by GSA on behalf of DHS to provide Continuous Monitoring as a Service (CMaaS) to support CDM integration. 

This initiative directly respondsto three key pieces of policy guidance for DHS and its role in federal network security. First, it supports DHS Mission Four, ""Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace. Secondly, it is in direct support of the Administration's 2015 Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal for implementing continuous monitoring across the federal network space. Finally, it supports OMB-14-03 which mandates agencies to use the CDM/CMaaS BPA as contract terms expire for information security continuous monitoring systems, and suggests that agencies leverage the DHS CDM program.

The ROI reflected in the AA section of the Exhibit 300 is reflective of the Solution Engineering Analysis. Within the AA, there was an assumption that since mitigation was not included within the investment, there could be no claim of removal of threat. However, the solution engineering analysis determined that the best approach would be an ROI calculated based on the potential mitigation of known threats and vulnerabilities. The ROI is based solely upon benefits/investment of Increment 1 since Increments 2 and 3 are not currently defined well enough to determine benefits. ROI is calculated as Rate of Return = (Gain of Investment/ Cost of Investment) - 1.
 
Three sources were used to calculate the benefits of mitigation activities. Method 1 - Cost Per Attack; Method 2 - Ponemon Institute/HP Study 2011; Method 3 - Banking Article. These three sources are all comparable, calculating the same benefits. The three sources were averaged because it is unknown which source would represent a more realistic scenario to the federal government. The true benefits could lie anywhere within the range shown in these calculations.
 
As stated above, these three methods were averaged. The average benefit would be approximately $0.9B in BY13$. Then, to calculate the ROI, to the $0.9B, the difference in O&M costs from the baseline were added, and then that result was divided by the Investment + PMO costs for Increment 1 would be the following:

LSCMS provides FEMA with the flexibility to respond to and recover from all hazards as well as provide full disaster supply chain visibility to FEMA and its partners.  Specifically, the goals of LSCMS include the ability to:

 - Manage the entire supply chain, including FEMA-owned assets and resources as well as those provided by partners in other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
 - Ensure the right resources/commodities are available at the right place and time 
 - Divert resources/commodities based on changing demand
 - Know the location and status of capital assets, commodities, and all other resources in real time
 - See inventory at all distribution nodes (e.g. Distribution Centers (DCs), Incident Support Bases (ISBs), Mobile Housing Unit (MHU) sites, and material delivered to state staging areas and local Points of Distribution (PODs)
 - Integrate with the supply chains of partners in federal government agencies, and other Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) and non-ESF federal agencies, NGOs, and logistics service vendors
 - Share supply chain data with state/local/tribal governments
 - Provide a resource that all FEMA strategic partners can use to support transparent and fully coordinated end-to-end disaster response
 - Provide supply chain visibility to all stakeholders
 - Scale resources to meet requirements

Stakeholders of LSCMS include DHS/FEMA senior leadership, FEMA logistics management, FEMA regional management, FEMA IT (e.g., EA and Security), and other FEMA Divisions (e.g., National Preparedness, Disaster Assistance, Disaster Operations), State/local/tribal government, Emergency Support Function agencies, vendors/suppliers/carriers/logistics providers, oversight bodies (including Congress, OMB, GAO, OIG), and media.  Direct customers are FEMA HQ and regions, ESF partners, and state emergency managers and responders.

An analysis of gaps to current requirements, a limited analysis of alternatives (AoA) to address the gaps, and an operational benchmarking similar to other logistics operations is to be performed. The LSCMS Program Office worked with DHS to obtain AoA contractor expertise from MITRE - timeframe to complete the AoA Study Plan is 11/20/14 and the Limited AoA by 11/30/15.
 
Annual LSCMS acquisition costs vary, O&M costs change as development components are implemented and public benefits, disaster frequency and severity are unpredictable. The ROI formula has too many unpredictable components to be calculated precisely, but an ROI qualitative analysis is useful:
ROI=(((Original Baseline O&M - New Total O&M) + Other Benefits to Society)/Acquisition Cost Only)-1
   
The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2024 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in ""benefits to society. 
 - Previous O&M = averaged $29.85M
 - New O&M = $24.88M
With increasing resource costs, O&M costs are not anticipated to decrease.

The investment goal is to simplify, streamline, and integrate administrative, financial, and performance operations for grant programs, with benefits and cost savings for governments, grantees, and the public. This is achieved through automating business processes, eliminating paperwork, reducing administrative burden, and improving data. For example, by streamlining grant processes, HUD has: reduced time to competitive award for homeless assistance from 140 days to 55 days in FY14; saved communities an estimated 65,000 staff hours (and HUD 30,000) each year in consolidated planning activities, beginning FY15; reduced from 90 days to 45 days average time to complete grantee risk analysis; and maintained the information systems that serve as the primary business interface for over 10,000 users. This improves program results and outcomes for citizens by supporting grantee capacity to execute HUD s mission. As jurisdictions, non-profits, and citizens recover from economic recession, HUD s housing, community development, disaster recovery, and homeless programs are more important than ever. HUD's grantees are direct agents for improving high-poverty neighborhoods, creating affordable housing, generating jobs and providing targeted services to low-income families, the homeless, veterans, HIV/AIDS patients, the unemployed and those suffering foreclosure. This investment automates grants management, program compliance, and financial control processes for these programs, re-directing resources from paperwork and towards direct service. Investment requests for O&amp;M costs cover operation of systems across the lifecycle: Grant Solutions, e-snaps (apply, assess, award, performance reporting); IDIS, DRGR (activity setup, grant funds control, performance reporting); and GMP, PERMS, GMS (grant performance reporting, monitoring, and compliance).

It also provides complementary, near real-time science data for operational use by other agencies. EOSDIS processes, archives, and distributes Earth science data from NASA missions. Data are processed at near real-time rates or faster to support NASA's field campaigns that require processed scientific products in near real-time to coincide with the measurements of field-deployed assets; to support benchmarking near real-time applications with operational agencies such as NOAA (weather models), DoD (field conditions), and DoI (forest fire information); and to support processing into higher level, discipline unique scientific products, archived for future use without building a processing backlog. Unique scientific products generated by EOSDIS need to be periodically reprocessed due to changes in instrument characteristics and improvements to scientific algorithms. This involves reprocessing the entire missions' data within short periods of time, requiring systems that must operate many times faster than real-time rates. This system  provides discipline unique tools, search capabilities and sub-setting capabilities built around the specific science, e.g., land processes, snow and ice, atmospheric composition, physical oceanography and geodesy.
The majority of the EOSDIS software is custom code, utilizing unique algorithms to accommodate the different instrumentation and science disciplines. The unique nature of the scientific applications as well as the high-speed capabilities needed to manage the processes involved in automatically generating the scientific products ensures that they can be instantaneously searched and accessed in order to distribute them to a broad, multidisciplinary user community on a daily basis. EOSDIS' expected accomplishments in FY15, FY16 and FY17 are to collect data from the current missions, process all data at keep-up rates, and distribute science data and science data products to research and applications users.
EOSDIS is in its operational phase supporting all EOS missions. At the end of FY14, EOSDIS archives held 9.1 petabytes of data, growing at 6.4 terabytes per day and supporting distribution to users at nearly 28 terabytes/day.

This increase in access and use occurs while the overall system budget experiences modest increases. Distribution has been increasing much faster than the project budget increases driving the cost to NASA per product distributed to users down to $0.12 as of mid FY2015. The budget changes are largely the result of additional functionality or responsibilities assigned to the system rather than increased cost of regular operations. For example EOSDIS added a Near Real-Time (NRT) capability, improved access to imagery, and developed a common platform for an improved web presence. The NRT capability called Land Atmospheres Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) leverages EOSDIS  distributed science processing to generate and distribute global near real-time products, creating data products within 3 hours from observation to support users such as natural resource managers, hazards and disasters workers, and scientists/researchers. EOSDIS provides Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), a full resolution image capability for visualizing data from EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive Centers.

The investment has been updated to reflect a strategic shift in the use of the Web as the primary platform for distributing information to help small businesses.    

Background: Business Gateway began as an e-Government Initiative in 2003. Managed by SBA, the program was a partnership of 22 Federal agencies, each of whom provided a portion of the program funding. The initiative focused on using information technology to improve the delivery of information and services to the small business community through the Business.gov Web site.  In FY 2010 there was a strategic decision to retire Business.gov and move the content to SBA.gov and BusinessUSA.gov.   

Future Plans: The redesigned SBA.gov Web site launched in FY 2011. SBA envisions continuous enhancement with major functional releases at least once a year. In FY 2015, SBA launched the following new projects:

- Spanish language SBA.gov
- Consolidated events and local resources into a new search tool
- Launched a new Video section
- Launched a new Blogs section
- Launched a new SBA.gov Homepage
- Conducted usability testing of various templates including 508 testing
- Launched both English and Spanish mobile platforms
- Redesigned SBA.gov templates to reflect contemporary dynamic content types

In addition, SBA s Digital Strategy continues  - content share APIs and other key data APIs have already been made available to the public.  

Additionally, through new sections of the site, including Blogs, Spanish, Social Media feeds and online campaigns, in addition to the online newsletters, SBA is able to better &quot;push&quot; users to the information they need, harnessing a high visit rate and thereby increasing retention. Approximately 25% of users have read an SBA blog which means the potential for strategically communicating SBA's programs and services in a timely way increases.

In FY 2015 alone, more than 677,000 Veterans received care from one or more of VA s Telehealth programs, totaling more than 2.1 million Telehealth visits. These visits occurred at more than 900 VA sites of care that have been equipped with the necessary resources to do so and also directly into the homes of more than 160,000 Veterans. In FY2015, about 12% of Veterans received elements of their care via telehealth.  Forty-five percent (45%) of these Veterans lived in rural areas, and may otherwise have had limited access to VA healthcare. Telehealth uses health informatics, disease management and innovative medical care technologies to improve access to care, improving the health of Veterans. Telehealth changes the location where health care services are routinely provided and is part of a spectrum of non-face-to-face care (i.e., Virtual Care) services that VA provides to Veteran patients. 
VA has three (3) Telehealth modalities, which are: Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT), Home Telehealth (HT), and Store and Forward Telehealth (SFT). Every type of Telehealth that VA provides is a clinical encounter that involves a synchronous or asynchronous interaction between a Veteran and a clinician that includes an assessment, education, instruction, diagnosis, and/or a clinical recommendation. One or more of these three Telehealth modalities can be applied to many traditional clinical care models to enable part or all of the care provided to be completed at a distance.  Collectively, these three national programs provide primary care, specialty care and care/case management in more than 45 clinical areas of care.  
VHA Telehealth Services is the VHA Program Office within VHA Connected Care that has stewardship for the development and sustainment of Telehealth Services throughout VA and collaborates closely with Office of Information and Technology (OIT) in the sustainment and enhancement of the enterprise-level Telehealth infrastructure. This enterprise-level infrastructure which supported the delivery of  more than 2.1 million Telehealth-based visits in FY 2015 develop and/or approve secure VA OIT interfaces with vendor technologies to support new models of Telehealth care, and 3) ensure quality and sustainability of clinical services being delivered via Telehealth.",029-065,"1012 - Improve Veteran Wellness and Economic Security","The HT Investment monitors patients with chronic conditions in their homes using HT devices linked to an enterprise VA IT platform. It allows Veteran patients to live independently at home, and reduces hospitalizations. Based upon the VA's existing Telehealth capabilities, and work undertaken in the HT Investment, the foundation is being set to increase Veteran usage capacity by 50 percent annually. CVT uses clinical videoconferencing technologies to provide clinical consultations between two VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and between VAMCs and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Scheduling has been identified as the single most powerful predictor of success in CVT. Because CVT encounters are synchronous events, the scheduling aspects of the clinical pathway have heightened importance. Clinic Based Telehealth encounters can be within a facility or health care system (Intra-facility), between facilities or health care systems (Inter-facility), or the Veteran patient may be located at a non-VA clinical setting. CVT provides an additional avenue for patient consultation and can contribute to decreased wait times for patient appointments.

The TSS program now addresses a much wider range of Telehealth appointment needs across the board whereas the original intent of the scheduling system was to solely address Clinical Video Teleconferencing appointment needs.

The purpose of VBMS is to develop and implement a comprehensive solution that integrates a 21st century web-based, paperless processing solution complemented by improved business processes. The goal of the Paperless Initiative is to deliver 21st Century Claims Processing services for the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) with a current focus on the Compensation and Pension (C&amp;P) business line as an integrated investment. C&amp;P, the largest VBA business line, depends on paper-based claims processing, with a substantive inventory and increasing backlog. The primary software component in the Paperless Initiative is the VBMS. VBMS is a paperless claims processing system that replaces legacy claims processing software, implements improved standard business practices for a paperless claims workflow, provides enterprise data services for external and internal communications, and is enabled by an enterprise, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework. The VBMS SOA-based technology platform provides VBA an enterprise set of capabilities for Enterprise Portal, Data Integration, Imaging, Forms Service, Rules Based Processing, Correspondence, Messaging, Workflow Services, and Content Management. As an integrated investment contributes to the mission by delivering the VBMS system that will provide C&amp;P the ability to increase handling and processing of over a million claims submitted a year and reduce inventory backlog, while continuing $3.7 billion in claims are paid each month. VBMS enhances services to veterans and their families by facilitating business line integration for automated, rules based claims processing with Education, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, Insurance, and Loan Guaranty, recognizing that some are highly automated through the VBMS SOA-based framework. This standardization of capabilities will reduce long term costs and align VBA enterprise requirements, which will align with the Office of Management and Budget requirements for integrating program acquisitions.

The purpose of the Health Registries' investment is to collect, store, update, and retrieve uniform patient data (clinical and other) in an organized manner to evaluate specified outcomes for the patient population defined by a particular disease, condition, or exposure.

All Health Registries are a critical component in monitoring Veterans' health status and planning patient care. The ability to track the Veteran's information allows health providers to ensure accurate and timely solutions that benefit the Veteran population.  The existing registries' ROI is best illustrated through support to VA's nationally recognized best clinical practices that result in lower costs and higher efficiency and effectiveness of treatment. This is evidenced in VA clinical outcome performance measures.  The registries allow for consistent approaches to data collection and evaluation of care outcomes and support research programs.

The CRS platform is designed to maintain and enhance the structure to more easily integrate the design and development of all registries, and minimizes duplication of effort among them. CRS obtains data from the Corporate Data Warehouse, synchronously from VistA, and/or by direct user input.

The solution utilizes a Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) interfaced with VistA to maintain systems integration with the more than 40 applications. The main laboratory modules provided by the COTS LIMS are General Laboratory, Microbiology, Anatomic Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics. A new graphical user interface allows lab users to accomplish primary business functions of specimen receiving, specimen tracking, quality control, testing, results documentation, and results verification.

Phoenix is a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) financial management system that replaced the New Management System (NMS) legacy financial management system.

Phoenix is USAID's single, worldwide accounting system, operational in headquarters and in missions overseas. It is a federally compliant and secure financial management system that allows Agency staff to analyze, manage and report on foreign assistance funds. Phoenix is USAID's accounting system of record and the basis for the Agency's financial statements and reporting. As the cornerstone of USAID's financial operation, Phoenix aligns with other Agency initiatives; the system is currently interfaced with several USAID and US Government IT solutions, and supports emerging needs presented by changes to USAID's IT portfolio. 

USAID staff, regardless of location, requires reliable and accessible tools that provide on-demand access to knowledge and information. A large portfolio of financial reports is available to help USAID staff access and interpret financial information. Users can access reports through four different tools: the Phoenix system itself via ""Phoenix Application"" reports, Business Objects Enterprise (BOE), PhoenixViewer, or PhoenixViewer Exec-Info. Many of these tools have undergone both routine and innovative changes. The Phoenix software system will be upgraded in July 2016 from Momentum version 7.0.2 to version 7.2.1 to allow the Agency to comply with Federal financial management requirements and use of government-wide solutions, including the ability to leverage the Invoice Processing Platform in FY 167/18 depending on funding, as well as aligning with Agency hardware and software standards such as Ping Federate's ""Single Sign On (SSO)"" solution.",184-036,"2112 - Encourage democratic governance as a force for stability, peace, and prosperity, 2286 - Enable diplomats and development professionals to influence and operate more efficiently, effectively, and collaboratively","The Phoenix system and related financial reports are used primarily by financial management staff at USAID. Operational effectiveness of the financial system and reports reduce the amount of time these employees need to spend manually accounting for USAID money, and allows them to shift their focus toward more value-add activities.

Ex: The upgrade to 7.2.1 in 2016 will include the following key benefits to the Agency and system users:
Global Dynamic Extensibility - allows for custom changes to the user interface by setting extensibility at the document type level, and on reference data tables, queries, and the Inbox. Dynamic Extensibility can tailor the user interface by hiding, moving, setting field lengths and renaming fields as well as marking fields as required or setting default values. This tool can cater to USAID's preference by simplifying pages and hiding unused fields as well as renaming fields.
Budget Module - includes improvements to budget data entry introducing a single page allowing all nodes to be viewed in a single location as opposed to separate multiple tabs when performing a budget transaction.
Invoicing Processing Platform (IPP) - provides the ability to transmit vendor, award/order and payment status data to IPP, as well as record receipt of invoices and credit memos from IPP into Momentum.
Invoice to Pay (I2P) - Matches data from the referenced document to the invoice which will populate header-level values (such as vendor information) reducing the amount of manual data entry required and decreasing the likelihood of user error.
*Note: Implementing IPP and I2P outlined above will be managed as separate from the overall scope of the 7.2.1 upgrade, as the projects are dependent on funding in FY17 and 18.

Sound financial data and useful reports also benefit USAID staff at all levels. They rely on this information to make programmatic decisions. Most of USAID's ""on the ground"" foreign assistance work is done by funding implementing partners, financial management is essential to the foreign assistance program cycle. USAID is aiming to attain greater process efficiency by promoting innovation through collaboration and process transparency.

This investment includes the following components:

(1) NRC Enterprise Acquisition Toolset (NEAT) Portal, a portal for accessing information related to the process of acquiring goods and services for the NRC. NEAT encompasses all phases of the acquisition lifecycle, and incorporates input from program offices that identify needs and provide oversight (performance and delivery): the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), which manages funds and payments, and the Acquisition Management Division (AMD), which manages contract actions.

(2) Strategic Acquisition System (STAQS), a shared service used to enforce standard acquisition processes and procedures, and to establish an automated end-to-end workflow. This system provides the agency with a standardized automated procurement business process for planning, developing, awarding, and administering procurement actions. It also provides standardized procurement reporting capabilities and is integrated with the agency's core financial system, FAIMIS, to allow for real-time commitment, obligation, and reconciliation of funds, as well as consistent reporting of agency spending.

The goal of Enterprise-wide Acquisition Services is to implement a 21st century acquisition program that transforms NRC's spending from a tactical to strategic focus and creates an acquisition environment that embraces both government and commercial leading best practices. The objectives are (1) to support a more integrated and informed acquisition program that leverages agency resources and contract dollars utilizing effective and efficient business processes and automated tools; (2) to standardize the procurement business processes throughout the agency; and (3) to integrate modernized procurement tools with the agency's core financial system. The key customers, stakeholders, and other beneficiaries are the acquisition workforce, financial managers, and agency staff.
