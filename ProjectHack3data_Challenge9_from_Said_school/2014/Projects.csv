The DLS project is intended to streamline and modernize current FLP inefficient, duplicative, and paper-based loan making and loan servicing processes and support both the USDA's Strategic Plan as well as the Agency's Strategic Plan by deploying solutions that are customer focused, collaborative and results oriented. As such, the primary mission of the DLS modernization effort is to deliver timely, effective programs and services to America's Farmers and Ranchers for ownership, operating, and emergency loans through a streamlined and modernized integration of IT platforms, processes, and data stores. Throughout the development of the CFLPIDS system, great care is taken in order to leverage existing technology, COTS packages, and new innovations in order to provide first-rate support to our customers through both in-office and mobile services. This system is a collaborative effort between Government and Contractor resources that is being developed using the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology and continually strives to leverage existing government technology, COTS functionality, as well as new technological developments to provide first-rate support to our End Users and customers. As functionality is migrated to the DLS system, outdated systems are being retired. The scope of this project has been well defined, however new developments will have a major impact on the existing project. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Farm Storage Facility Loan (FSFL) project resides on an outdated AS400 platform and was originally scheduled to be included in the MIDAS project. In FY 2012, due to delays in the MIDAS project, the decision was made to move the FSFL to the FLP IT platforms since they were similar loan programs.  This project will require significant modifications to the DLS system and require interfaces to the Farm Program (FP) back-End processes.","2002-10-01","2018-09-28","116.800000","0","0.00","Green","0.884000","3.87","Green","2013-08-20","17:08:50"

This new environment will move NRM in the direction of operating to a Cloud based operating paradigm.  This project will implement a data center environment that is cost efficient but also scalable and elastic in its configuration to allow for growth or reduction in computing and storage capacity as the need arises. The Infrastructure Modernization Project will support the following NRM Organization strategic goals.  (1) Ensure continued operations of NRM; (2) Align with Agency - Performance Accountability (Measure, Report, Improve) initiative; (3) Remove server asset management from the NRM program area and conform to USDA and FS National Data Center Consolidation Initiatives; (4) Optimize budget; and (5) CIO-BAO - Network Consolidation. Project Objectives include: (1) Replace ageing hardware, end of leased hardware with NITC provided Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); (2) Enhance capture and report of Performance Metrics impacted by implementing new infrastructure; (3) Migrate to a cloud methodology - utilize USDA NITC data center services in place of procuring hardware; (4) Allow flexibility of shifting of system resources based on demand; (5) Enable integration to Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) in Enterprise Data Center (EDC).The primary scope of this project is to establish new USDA NITC IaaS environments to support the existing NRM system components supporting Development, Test, Production, Training, and Continuity of Operations (Coop) also known as the Disaster Recovery site and to expand/adjust the infrastructure architecture of the environments to accommodate and support the infrastructure standards and requirements for the future NRM Architecture Modernization initiatives.   Additionally expand the environment to support rapid sandbox capabilities.","2013-04-01","2013-06-30","7.417000","-61","-67.78","Red","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-04-26","16:17:44"

NRM's FY13 year-end activities close out the FS current fiscal year business operations for the FRPP and the Performance Accountability System (PAS).  Applications feeding the year-end processes are Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS), Heritage, Infra (Engineering), Range, Recreation Sites, Roads, SUDS, TIM, Trails and Wilderness.   In a normal year, NRM's year-end activities involve a complex set of operations for summarizing data, transmitting data to external systems and archiving data for historical reference.  FY13 will not be any different.    Year end is one of the most important, complex tasks NRM accomplishes each year.

GCSS-MC is based upon the Marine Corps Logistics Operational Architecture and logistics business process reengineering initiatives. GCSS-MC is part of a joint GCSS effort, managed by the Joint Staff J-4, aimed at improving logistics capability and filling in deficiencies in the accuracy and timeliness of logistics data. GCSS-MC/LCM:  GCSS-MC Logistics Chain Management (LCM) is a program within GCSS-MC. It is comprised of Increments 1, 2, and 3.  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC.  It provides initial capabilities for GCSS-MC.  The system provides Combat Service Support functionality: Supply, Maintenance, Task Organization, and Request Tracking in a shared data environment in support of deployed operations. Specifically the system centralizes logistics information for access by multiple authorized users (closing a significant warfighting gap), complies with the J-4 GCSS Mission Area Interface Control Document that establishes a DoD Family of Systems for logistics information visibility and decision support, and satisfies initial Marine Corps requirements for meeting Combatant Commander 129/57 Data Elements that provide asset visibility data to Combatant and Joint Task Force Commanders.   GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1:  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC/LCM.  It is a separate acquisition program with its own milestone events.  It is based on the implementation of Oracle e-Business Suite 11i as the core software package.  Increment 1 provides the foundation for all future Marine Corps logistics systems modernization.  Increments 2 and 3 are not reported here because they have not officially been approved through the new Business Case Lifecycle (BCL) process.","2003-10-01","2023-09-30","1022.000000","30","1.85","Green","9.200000","2.29","Green","2013-08-05","11:34:51"

JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that is more affordable and will function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications. The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide. Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time. JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with U.S. allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities. JPALS will eventually support unmanned and highly automated aircraft, and will be able to operate during restricted Emission Control (EMCON) conditions.The approved JPALS Acquisition Strategy has acquisition broken into seven increments, based on technology maturity and Service needs. Increment 1 Sea Based JPALS is separated into two phases; Increment 1A ship based systems and Increment 1B aircraft integration.

The MDD also supported the development of acquisition planning documentation with a target to enter the formal acquisition process.    Phase I of the AoA focused on preliminary assessment of nine (9) alternatives; five (5) of the alternatives were considered potentially viable and carried into the AoA Phase II for more detailed analysis. During the second quarter of FY11, TMA was directed to pause the AoA to support the joint program analysis efforts undertaken by the DoD and VA.  On March 17, 2011, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the VA agreed to jointly pursue a common EHR acquisition.  The Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) (a follow on to originally proposed Electronic Health Record Way Ahead) is designed to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that is available anytime and anywhere for the lifetime of the patient. Since the original Electronic Health Record Way Ahead (EHR WA) has now become a joint DoD/VA program, iEHR has received an Acquistion Decision Memorandum and is now an official DoD program.

AKO''s life cycle management plan projects a 20% technology replacement annually and an annual supplement of the storage capacity.  The technology refresh scheduled for this OPA requirement replaces aging Cisco network equipment to include switches, routers and firewalls in both the primary and secondary data centers and on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET.  Much of the AKO Cisco network equipment has aged to the point where it is no longer supported by the vendor.  Hardware failure will cause AKO services to go offline for days, denying users and organizations access to Army applications as well as access to their files and other information until suitable replacement equipment can be procured. These Cisco devices also include firewall devices to meet information assurance requirements. Without the technology refresh of these firewalls, security deficiencies cannot be remediated and the Army LandWarNet is exposed to risk. The storage supplement requirement adds storage capacity, backup capacity and replication capacity to our existing storage services.

DCPDS relies on digital signatures that are electronically signed and validated using SHA.  By using a private key that is paired with a public key, both generated using SHA, a file can be electronically signed and the signature verified by a recipient.  SHA is also used to provide assurance that a file has not been altered during transmission.  The current standard for that utility is known as SHA-1.  DoD has mandated that all DoD systems use a new version of SHA-2 no later than December 2013.

It is assumed a private K-12 cloud (a hybrid with a minimum of federal, state, and third party entities) will be formed and an organization such as SIFA or CCSSO will assume the role of data aggregator that includes accepting and providing federal reporting data to EDFacts. Similar to the Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) initiative, ED would take the lead to control requirements and development to ensure the cloud is vetted by the federal government. If the development of a K-12 cloud takes longer than expected, the push/pull solution would be implemented using other cloud hosting, eventually moving to the K-12 cloud. EMAPS is the pilot application that moves to the cloud, testing changes needed to move remaining EDFacts applications to the cloud. EDFacts functions will be re-architected into an integrated application, starting with redesign of the data model. Three main EDFacts components are envisioned in the redesigned system: Data provider, data storage, and data usage applications. Redesign ensures EDFacts will work efficiently and effectively in the cloud. Design considerations include upgrading applications so that user interfaces are cohesive, consistent, and up-to-date, integrating both single-sign-on and eventually social media.","2012-08-13","2017-09-30","283.231055","0","0.00","Green","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-08-26","10:18:03"

It will also require establishing a TEP, which will provide input and advice on the development of the new BioSense Program. It will further require producing standardized system requirements for program design concepts and prototypes, which can be developed using open-source/open-access tools. Program design concepts and prototypes will be reviewed and evaluated internally and by an external group of end users. The final selected program design concept/ prototype will include specification, security requirements, proposed program development, testing and evaluation, and documentation.

MA plans are paid approximately $13 billion per month for the more than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans.  Improvements in the accuracy of these payments will have a significant impact on the program. The current risk adjustment model is estimated using Fee-For-Service (FFS) cost and diagnoses data. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has shown that patterns in FFS and MA diagnostic data differ in important ways and lead to overpayments to MA plans. Adding health care encounter data to the existing risk adjustment system will improve the accuracy of the risk adjustment model used to pay MA plans by reflecting the appropriate patterns of utilization and costs within the MA program. While establishing a risk adjustment model more appropriate for MA plans is the paramount reason for collecting MA encounter data, there are other important uses of the data that will improve other key functions undertaken by CMS, including: calculation of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, quality review and improvement activities, and Medicare coverage purposes. Thus, there is a need to properly collect, edits, and store the MA health care data necessary to describe and price a health care encounter; this is in addition to the currently collected, edited and stored diagnosis data.  There is also a need to develop the capability to price the MA health care encounter data to be able to estimate the cost of a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in an MA plan. The EDS project will assist CMS in achieving its agency-wide goal of reaching accurate and predictable payments.  Specifically, those paid through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx). The three main objectives to obtain with the implementation of the EDS project are: Collection and pricing of more than 330 million claims annually supporting 11 million beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program, Obtain reports that reflect true MA beneficiary utilization by 2013, and Providing appropriate data leading to more accurate Risk Adjustment model development by 2015.","2009-01-01","2015-01-01","45.430000","0","0.00","Green","-0.602000","-3.39","Green","2013-08-01","14:58:11"

The original goal of MAS was to utilize MAS throughout the five levels of the Medicare appeals process. This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process. The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed.  Given the MAS' capabilities for cross-level case tracking, interfacing with the shared systems, and electronic imaging, we believe that expanding use of the MAS to encompass first level appeals has the potential to create significant efficiencies in the claim appeals process. Thus, CMS is exploring options to implement the MAS at all Durable Medical Equipment MACs (DME MACs) and Part A and Part B MACs (A/B MACs).","2011-09-30","2012-09-29","0.420000","-107","-43.85","Red","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-01-30","16:14:17"

The FDA needs to modernize its aging systems, improve its analytic capabilities, and make it easier for the public to submit adverse event and safety reports to the FDA.  FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) is a Web-based Oracle database application and Business Intelligence data warehouse that will replace legacy AERS (Adverse Event Reporting System).  FAERS will contain post-market adverse event reports associated with drugs and biologic products.  These adverse event reports are submitted to FDA by manufacturers, healthcare professionals, and consumers.  FDA will use FAERS for regulatory compliance, and to monitor for adverse events and medication errors that might occur with approved products.  FAERS is an Oracle operational database. Operational databases can store large amounts of data, and allow users to quickly enter, revise, and retrieve information from one system.  When FAERS replaces AERS, FAERS will contain more than six million adverse event reports, and the dataset will continually change as new reports or follow up information is entered into the database.","2009-04-01","2014-09-18","27.369000","0","0.00","Green","-1.930000","-7.09","Green","2013-08-01","14:57:11"

MARCS is divided into a set of components. There are application and service components. The work flows in ORA will often cross multiple organizations and include a number of different user activity types such as screening, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, and compliance. The application components are designed to provide user groups with a one stop shop interface that will allow them to perform work from their user point of view. Functionality is only implemented once in a component. One user group work flow may use functionality from most of the MARCS components. This has implications for the management of MARCS. While the individual projects build out certain types of functionality, these need to be combined and coordinated into a whole in order to provide a useful work flow that covers the whole life cycle of a regulated product as it passes from one user group to the next. This combination and coordination needs to occur at the program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. PMTI includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI begins work on a release when it is time to start system integration testing. Work for a release includes system integration testing, promotion to the pre-production environment, performance testing, user acceptance testing, promotion to the production environment, security testing, and then release. Program management in this project includes release management and management of dependencies.

MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences. OPA is a rules engine that will have a number of applications in MARCS ranging from inspection preparation, intelligent questionnaires, and import screening support. RUEI is a tool that can be used from a centralized location to determine the experience that an end user at a remote site is having. ORA is a geographically dispersed organization. In this sense, the user community for MARCS is different from Center user communities since the vast majority of users are not in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This tool will give ORA and OIM a new ability to understand what is actually happening at user sites and will enable a systematic approach towards improving performance and reliability in the Field. The software acquired will be used in all of the MARCS projects going forward to one degree or another and will enable MARCS functionality that will be realized in releases.","2011-08-04","2011-09-30","4.856000","0","0.00","Green","0.000000","0.00","Green","2012-09-12","16:10:44"

This includes receiving firm information from registration and listing from the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS). FURLS is being partially replaced by eLIST. FMLS will integrate with eLIST (no acronym). The firm data is built around Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). These define a location and a product or a set of products. A large company may have multiple FEIs if it has multiple physical locations and/or produces different products that are regulated by FDA. This information is always changing as firms and market conditions change.  In addition, foreign firms that do not use a Latin alphabet present a particular problem as words can be transliterated into English in different ways. If this is left unchecked, it causes a proliferation of FEIs that are not all that useful in identifying what firm is what. To address this, FMLS employs Dataflux, a COTS, in implementing survivorship rules that are used to clean up this firm data and consolidate and remove FEIs. FMLS is also being integrated with Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB). DnB has one of the largest and most reliable databases on businesses in the world.

The scope of this project is to (1) define an HHS-wide reporting strategy, and (2) to implement Oracle's Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) and address this business need for users of UFMS.  This project heavily leverages work performed by FDA on their OBIEE pilot.  This involved implementation of OBIEE Plus for use by approximately 50 seat licenses; configuration of extract, transform, and load (ETL) routines to load FDA data from UFMS and to address Oracle Descriptive FlexFields (DFFs); and enhancement and development of dashboards and reports to meet FDA specific business needs.  These configurations and enhancements can be adjusted to enable rapid development and delivery of a global UFMS data warehouse for use with OBIEE.  Program data can be integrated either through individual data warehouses for each set of books (SOB), or loaded into the single central warehouse.  While our preliminary analysis indicates a hybrid approach that shares a central financial data warehouse with OpDiv-specific program data warehouses as most likely the best fit architecture for OpDiv business needs, the detailed OBIEE needs assessment work that is being planned by the UFMS Program Management Office (PMO) will determine the specific details of the go-forward solution.

This also addresses a common sentiment among the user groups that UFMS is an accounting system rather than a financial management system.The Hyperion Performance-Based Budgeting Solution provides an enterprise-level solution for budget formulation, execution, and distribution, which eliminates the need for multiple spreadsheets, separate feeder applications, and numerous individual processes.  This will allow users to spend less time reconciling data and more time analyzing and planning, provides for more accurate reports to OMB, the ability to monitor and measure agency performance against agency goals, provides security and audit trails, and offers a variety of statements and reports.  This solution seeks to replace cuff systems that are currently used by budget staff across HHS agencies to meet the functionality gap that exists today.  From an application architecture perspective, the budget solution will integrate with:*         Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS) *         Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) applications that form the Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) foundation of UFMS*         Consolidated Financial Reporting System (CFRS)The Dashboard and HHS-Wide Reporting solution that is a part of this modernization program.","2011-09-30","2014-07-31","6.475000","0","0.00","Green","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-03-19","11:10:00"

CTEP-ESYS tracks more than 27,000 patients per year in more than 24 disease areas. The system supports 517,000 drug orders and 37,000 registered investigators. Data reporting and analysis in real time is critical to ensuring adequate monitoring of the ongoing clinical research. Timely data reporting and analysis also assures effective planning for the required successor studies, thus accelerating the evaluation of promising new agents and regimens for patients with cancer. An effective CTEP-ESYS allows investigators and researchers to focus on scientific opportunity, patient safety and reducing the burden of cancer on the public by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. There are many components that support CTEP needs including protocol tracking, agent authorization and tracking, clinical data reporting, adverse event reporting and processing, clinical trials auditing, financial management, investigational new agent and development, disease management and tracking, annual report generation, regulatory activities, account management, investigator registration, reporting and analysis. CTEP-ESYS consist of a common repository that interfaces with suite of applications that are integrated and support the cancer-clinical trials infrastructure.","2009-02-01","2016-01-31","9.000000","0","0.00","Green","0.400000","4.44","Green","2013-05-24","13:58:43"

The TIC Initiative establishes a basis for consolidated infrastructure to achieve interoperability and communication among operating divisions.  In response to this initiative, HHS will adopt a network and security architecture that complies with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) TIC requirements and reduces the total number of external connections to include Internet, inter-agency, partner, contractor, educational, health and research connectivity.   Once implemented, the TIC environment will improve HHS's incident response capability; reduce the number of external connection points within HHS; and provide centralized monitoring of HHS network security controls.  HHS TIC aligns with the HHS 2007-2012 Strategic Plan for IT infrastructure consolidation.

The number of quality measures to be included for 2012 is not established at this time.  There were 190 quality measures in 2011.  For 2012 there will continue to be multiple reporting options through claims and will continue to include measure groups.  The Physician Quality Reporting System will support multiple submission methods such as Electronic Health Record Registry and Group Practices Reporting Options (GPROs I and II).  It is anticipated that the incentive will be based, as in past years, on the total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the reporting period.Continuing in 2012, there will be the Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Initiative which is available for those EP's that are considered successful electronic prescribers (eRx-ers) as defined in the CMS eRx specifications.  As in 2011, both individual and selected GPROs may report on the eRx measure through claims, registries or EHR's.  Successful eRx-ers will potentially earn an incentive payment based on their total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the 12 month reporting period.  Currently successful electronic prescribers will not be eligible to receive an incentive under the eRx Incentive Program if they are also receiving an incentive under the Health Information Technology (HIT) Incentive Program authorized by the Recovery Act, enacted on February 17, 2009. Future rule making may further align the incentives programs. EP's that are not electronic prescribers will receive a penalty adjustment starting in 2012 based on the first 6 months of claims data submitted in 2011.  The eRx Initiative will provide Interim Feedback Reporting to EP's.  Measures and other data sources may be added for the 2012 Program Year to allow EP's options for successfully reporting the eRx measure for both the penalty and incentive programs.EP's may have the flexibility of expanding and adding additional hardship codes for exemption for all years.","2012-03-10","2014-06-30","82.240000","0","0.00","Green","-0.689000","-0.86","Green","2013-08-30","16:04:42"

By 2014, it is expected that an additional 16 million people will become eligible for Medicaid and CHIP as a result of the Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148 - Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). In order to implement the statute, CMS must provide for a mechanism to ensure timely approval of Medicaid and CHIP state plans, waivers and demonstrations and provide for a repository for all Medicaid and CHIP program that supplies data to populate  Healthcare.gov (sec. 1103) as well as other required reports. With these tremendous statutory changes in the Medicaid and CHIP programs, CMS will undergo a transformation from a reactive, mostly paper based processing entity to an active, electronic based program manager by automating and streamlining the current systems and processes.CMS is in the process of evaluating Medicaid systems currently operating, in order to build an enterprise architecture platform and data repository.  Ideally, CMS would allow for a single point of entry to access various program and operational data applications.  This effort will be implemented in phases over several years.  Phase 1 will provide for a Medicaid and CHIP Program data system (MACPro) accessed through a web portal/portlet that will automate the input and retrieval of data from the states related to the State Medicaid and CHIP Plans (including Demonstrations and Waivers).  This system will also support an efficient workflow for the review and approval of the State Medicaid and CHIP process. States will access this system and submit program information into structured data templates.  CMS staff will review the templates for compliance with federal statute, regulation and policy, provide feedback to the states and track/monitor the review and approval process.  Future project phasing will provide for the design, delivery and implementation of financial management programs and performance and quality metrics. CMS must meet a hard deadline for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Initial operational concept development and validation efforts have concluded that in high altitude airspace, the local knowledge information needed is considerably less than in lower altitude airspace and that different operating strategies can be used to more dynamically adjust staffing and airspace to meet demand and reduce operating costs. By providing local knowledge through information accessible through the controller display and other tools, there will be increased flexibility in the assignment of airspace to controllers, increasing overall productivity and flexibility to deal with weather and congestion events. This activity will work to define and develop the information display and decision support tool changes to provide this local knowledge and conduct human-in-the-loop simulations with controllers to assess the effectiveness of the information content and automation and display changes to enable rapid training (in terms of hours) of controllers to safely and efficiently control the airspace.","2010-10-01","2012-09-30","2.505128","0","0.00","Green","-1.448810","-57.83","Red","2013-05-31","17:25:55"

Conflict resolution advisories will first be implemented using voice and data in a mixed equipage environment, and ultimately will be transmitted solely via data in certain airspace. The implications for changing controller roles and responsibilities will be explored and the requirements for automation, decision support systems and data communications will be identified. High performance aircraft will directly connect via air-ground data communications to the flight management system, facilitating electronic data communications between the Air Traffic Control (ATC) automation and the flight deck automation. As a first step and in mixed performance airspace, the controller will still be responsible for aircraft separation by responding to problems predicted by the ATC automation. Instead of monitoring the sector airspace display to predict potential problems and mentally calculating problem resolutions, the automation will not only predict the problems but determine the best solution. The controller will transmit the solution via voice initially, and then via data link. This level of automation support helps manage controller workload as a means of safely dealing with the predicted increases in traffic volume. This activity will prototype earlier and easier resolutions capabilities (such as pre-probed altitude and speed amendments) that can be transferred verbally by controllers and evaluate the impact these have on the Computer Human Interface (CHI) design and system performance and conduct research into more complex issues for future implementation such as vector advisories as well as the role of the human versus automation in voice clearance, mixed voice and data communications environments, and data communications only.","2010-10-01","2012-09-30","3.092484","60","8.22","Green","-0.339956","-10.99","Yellow","2013-05-31","17:25:56"

Metered times at key merge points will be used by air traffic managers. For this type of operation, an aircraft's Meter Point Time (MPT) is assigned to determine when it enters into the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) airspace so it can be efficiently routed to the assigned runway. Metering will take into account runway load balancing and will serve to reduce (not eliminate) the need for delay absorption needed for aircraft inside the TRACON airspace. As the FAA transitions to NextGen, aircraft will increasingly be assigned to RNP/RNAV routes and have modern avionics that include Flight Management Systems (FMS) capable of executing Required Time of Arrival (RTA) instructions. The RTA capability provides a time-based control mechanism that supports the trajectory-based operations concept. RTAs will be used for the management of arrival traffic to an airport. The use of RTAs will take advantage of existing capabilities expected to become more widespread throughout the fleet. The FMS in the aircraft computes the most efficient change to the original trajectory to meet the RTA. In addition, the FMS can independently self deliver to the RTA, thus reducing significantly the coordination needed between the user and ATC. Since the FMS actively and directly controls the aircraft to meet the RTA, very accurate arrival is possible with minimal human intervention.","2010-10-01","2012-09-30","7.747247","0","0.00","Green","-1.988185","-25.66","Yellow","2013-05-31","17:26:46"

Weather conditions create low visibility conditions that require Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) to go into effect. Even for those aircraft with suitably trained crew and equipage, conditions may worsen, causing flight diversion, flight cancellation, or flight delays, each of which can result in a cascading ripple effect that can spread throughout the National Airspace System (NAS), even to areas where weather is not an issue. There are periods of low visibility when the aircraft cannot takeoff or land at their desired airport resulting in the following conditions: decreased numbers of arrivals/departures at high density airports; increased flight delays, cancellations, and/or diversions under IFR low visibility conditions; decreased capacity for airlines to schedule flights in marginal weather conditions (since both the primary and alternate routes must be approved within the flight plan); and decreased flexibility/potential congestion in the terminal environment. These problems can limit or prevent access to airports in IFR conditions, resulting in congestion and delay in the NAS. Even under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), access to airports and utilization of airspace can be made more flexible, particularly in the terminal environment. Therefore, lowering required RVR minima will improve capacity during low visibility operations by allowing runways that would otherwise be unusable to continue to support airport operations.","2011-10-01","2014-09-30","4.000000","0","0.00","Green","1.000000","25.00","Yellow","2013-06-28","14:44:36"

Enhancements to the tool and ongoing maintenance of the application itself are needed.Currently, the application form that Crisis Line staff use does not electronically integrate the use of standard, industry-wide nomenclature that properly classifies self-directed violence. Instead, staff must record the levels of self-directed violence classifications manually into the free text comments field. Unfortunately, nomenclature used in this free-text field cannot be extracted as discrete data elements. As a result, the Suicide Prevention Center of Excellence, which gathers data from the Veterans Crisis Line Application, does not have the ability to properly report on self-directed violence in a manner that is consistent with industry nomenclature and standards. This leads to the inability of the VA to share and compare its information with other suicide prevention centers.","2012-05-15","2017-09-30","4.608063","-58","-13.12","Yellow","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-08-30","10:55:03"
