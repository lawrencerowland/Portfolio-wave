The DLS project is intended to streamline and modernize current FLP inefficient, duplicative, and paper-based loan making and loan servicing processes and support both the USDA's Strategic Plan as well as the Agency's Strategic Plan by deploying solutions that are customer focused, collaborative and results oriented. As such, the primary mission of the DLS modernization effort is to deliver timely, effective programs and services to America's Farmers and Ranchers for ownership, operating, and emergency loans through a streamlined and modernized integration of IT platforms, processes, and data stores. Throughout the development of the CFLPIDS system, great care is taken in order to leverage existing technology, COTS packages, and new innovations in order to provide first-rate support to our customers through both in-office and mobile services. This system is a collaborative effort between Government and Contractor resources that is being developed using the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology and continually strives to leverage existing government technology, COTS functionality, as well as new technological developments to provide first-rate support to our End Users and customers. As functionality is migrated to the DLS system, outdated systems are being retired. The scope of this project has been well defined, however new developments will have a major impact on the existing project. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Farm Storage Facility Loan (FSFL) project resides on an outdated AS400 platform and was originally scheduled to be included in the MIDAS project. In FY 2012, due to delays in the MIDAS project, the decision was made to move the FSFL to the FLP IT platforms since they were similar loan programs.  This project will require significant modifications to the DLS system and require interfaces to the Farm Program (FP) back-End processes.","2002-10-01","2018-09-28","116.800000","0","0.00","Green","1.431000","6.27","Green","2014-07-25","12:34:30"

GCSS-MC is based upon the Marine Corps Logistics Operational Architecture and logistics business process reengineering initiatives. GCSS-MC is part of a joint GCSS effort, managed by the Joint Staff J-4, aimed at improving logistics capability and filling in deficiencies in the accuracy and timeliness of logistics data. GCSS-MC/LCM:  GCSS-MC Logistics Chain Management (LCM) is a program within GCSS-MC. It is comprised of Increments 1, 2, and 3.  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC.  It provides initial capabilities for GCSS-MC.  The system provides Combat Service Support functionality: Supply, Maintenance, Task Organization, and Request Tracking in a shared data environment in support of deployed operations. Specifically the system centralizes logistics information for access by multiple authorized users (closing a significant warfighting gap), complies with the J-4 GCSS Mission Area Interface Control Document that establishes a DoD Family of Systems for logistics information visibility and decision support, and satisfies initial Marine Corps requirements for meeting Combatant Commander 129/57 Data Elements that provide asset visibility data to Combatant and Joint Task Force Commanders.   GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1:  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC/LCM.  It is a separate acquisition program with its own milestone events.  It is based on the implementation of Oracle e-Business Suite 11i as the core software package.  Increment 1 provides the foundation for all future Marine Corps logistics systems modernization.

JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that is more affordable and will function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications. The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide. Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time. JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with U.S. allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities. JPALS will eventually support unmanned and highly automated aircraft, and will be able to operate during restricted Emission Control (EMCON) conditions.The approved JPALS Acquisition Strategy has acquisition broken into seven increments, based on technology maturity and Service needs. Increment 1 Sea Based JPALS is separated into two phases; Increment 1A ship based systems and Increment 1B aircraft integration.

The MDD also supported the development of acquisition planning documentation with a target to enter the formal acquisition process.    Phase I of the AoA focused on preliminary assessment of nine (9) alternatives; five (5) of the alternatives were considered potentially viable and carried into the AoA Phase II for more detailed analysis. During the second quarter of FY11, TMA was directed to pause the AoA to support the joint program analysis efforts undertaken by the DoD and VA.  On March 17, 2011, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the VA agreed to jointly pursue a common EHR acquisition.  The Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) (a follow on to originally proposed Electronic Health Record Way Ahead) is designed to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that is available anytime and anywhere for the lifetime of the patient. Since the original Electronic Health Record Way Ahead (EHR WA) has now become a joint DoD/VA program, iEHR has received an Acquistion Decision Memorandum and is now an official DoD program.

AKO''s life cycle management plan projects a 20% technology replacement annually and an annual supplement of the storage capacity.  The technology refresh scheduled for this OPA requirement replaces aging Cisco network equipment to include switches, routers and firewalls in both the primary and secondary data centers and on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET.  Much of the AKO Cisco network equipment has aged to the point where it is no longer supported by the vendor.  Hardware failure will cause AKO services to go offline for days, denying users and organizations access to Army applications as well as access to their files and other information until suitable replacement equipment can be procured. These Cisco devices also include firewall devices to meet information assurance requirements. Without the technology refresh of these firewalls, security deficiencies cannot be remediated and the Army LandWarNet is exposed to risk. The storage supplement requirement adds storage capacity, backup capacity and replication capacity to our existing storage services.

The LMP Inc 2 will also provided the expanded capability for the standardization of ammunition AIT, Non-Army Managed Items (NAMI) management, Army Prepositioned Stock (APS) planning, National Maintenance Program (NMP), and the expansion and refinement of the integration between Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. These requirements have emerged from the DoD, the Army and the AMC industrial base. The fundamental concept is to leverage the LMP Inc 1, integrate commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products (i.e., SAP Complex Assembly Manufacturing Solution (CAMS) and SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (MII)), and connect the necessary AIT while supporting the AMC Business Process Reengineering (BPR) efforts. The LMP Inc 2 expanded capabilities will be designed and tested together in a comprehensive solution based on the SAP software. Expanding the LMP solution with the COTS capability from the same vendor, provides pre-integrated key touch points and ensures compatibility as software product upgrades occur in the future. The complexity involved in implementing the LMP Inc 2 requirements independently is neither logical nor supportable within current resource constraints. The solution for these requirements will be designed, built, and tested together and implemented in cohesive packages to the LMP user community that will meet the critical needs of the various stakeholders, enabling the Department to achieve a clean audit while providing interoperable tools for total asset visibility across the Defense Enterprise. Ultimately, LMP Increment 2 will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the currently deployed solution; will provide access to real-time supply chain information at all levels of the enterprise down through the shop floor; will result in improve visibility of work-in-process (WIP), quality management, capacity planning, and traceability; and provide electronic work instructions.

GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time. GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. OCX funds the Research & Development for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator. This includes the advanced concept development, systems analysis, modernized control segment development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and developmental test resources, and systems engineering required to meet the government''s obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification. OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare and signal monitoring, and 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations. GPS Enterprise Integrator is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the Enterprise. OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies'' use of GPS.

It is assumed a private K-12 cloud (a hybrid with a minimum of federal, state, and third party entities) will be formed and an organization such as SIFA or CCSSO will assume the role of data aggregator that includes accepting and providing federal reporting data to EDFacts. Similar to the Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) initiative, ED would take the lead to control requirements and development to ensure the cloud is vetted by the federal government. If the development of a K-12 cloud takes longer than expected, the push/pull solution would be implemented using other cloud hosting, eventually moving to the K-12 cloud. EMAPS is the pilot application that moves to the cloud, testing changes needed to move remaining EDFacts applications to the cloud. EDFacts functions will be re-architected into an integrated application, starting with redesign of the data model. Three main EDFacts components are envisioned in the redesigned system: Data provider, data storage, and data usage applications. Redesign ensures EDFacts will work efficiently and effectively in the cloud. Design considerations include upgrading applications so that user interfaces are cohesive, consistent, and up-to-date, integrating both single-sign-on and eventually social media.","2012-07-16","2017-09-30","283.231055","0","0.00","Green","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-10-28","13:28:58"

Activities include collection of new information on end-user requirements and comparison with other existing syndromic surveillance systems that could be adapted to produce standardized system requirements and program design concepts for revisions to the BioSense Program. This will include gathering end-user requirements through formal and informal communication, utilizing unstructured data to gather information on other syndromic surveillance systems and system needs, developing an Operational Plan, and reviewing/revising the existing Strategic Plan to reflect changes in the BioSense Program. It will also require establishing a TEP, which will provide input and advice on the development of the new BioSense Program. It will further require producing standardized system requirements for program design concepts and prototypes, which can be developed using open-source/open-access tools. Program design concepts and prototypes will be reviewed and evaluated internally and by an external group of end users. The final selected program design concept/ prototype will include specification, security requirements, proposed program development, testing and evaluation, and documentation. Management support will include the following:- updating the existing BioSense Strategic Plan;- assessing the risks inherent in this plan (already commenced, but assessment of the risks will be ongoing throughout the project);- producing and actively maintaining a Risk Mitigation Plan for the BioSense Program;- providing project support and administration.","2010-06-07","2014-06-30","15.600000","0","0.00","Green","0.685000","4.40","Green","2014-07-22","16:16:08"

MA plans are paid approximately $13 billion per month for the more than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans.  Improvements in the accuracy of these payments will have a significant impact on the program. The current risk adjustment model is estimated using Fee-For-Service (FFS) cost and diagnoses data. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has shown that patterns in FFS and MA diagnostic data differ in important ways and lead to overpayments to MA plans. Adding health care encounter data to the existing risk adjustment system will improve the accuracy of the risk adjustment model used to pay MA plans by reflecting the appropriate patterns of utilization and costs within the MA program. While establishing a risk adjustment model more appropriate for MA plans is the paramount reason for collecting MA encounter data, there are other important uses of the data that will improve other key functions undertaken by CMS, including: calculation of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, quality review and improvement activities, and Medicare coverage purposes. Thus, there is a need to properly collect, edits, and store the MA health care data necessary to describe and price a health care encounter; this is in addition to the currently collected, edited and stored diagnosis data.  There is also a need to develop the capability to price the MA health care encounter data to be able to estimate the cost of a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in an MA plan. The EDS project will assist CMS in achieving its agency-wide goal of reaching accurate and predictable payments.  Specifically, those paid through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx). The three main objectives to obtain with the implementation of the EDS project are: Collection and pricing of more than 648 million claims annually supporting 11 million beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program, obtain reports that reflect true MA beneficiary utilization by 2013, and Providing appropriate data leading to more accurate Risk Adjustment model development by 2015.","2009-01-01","2015-01-01","45.430000","0","0.00","Green","-7.084000","-39.86","Red","2014-06-26","12:48:13"

The original goal of MAS was to utilize MAS throughout the five levels of the Medicare appeals process. This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process. The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed.  Given the MAS' capabilities for cross-level case tracking, interfacing with the shared systems, and electronic imaging, we believe that expanding use of the MAS to encompass first level appeals has the potential to create significant efficiencies in the claim appeals process. Thus, CMS is exploring options to implement the MAS at all Durable Medical Equipment MACs (DME MACs) and Part A and Part B MACs (A/B MACs).","2011-09-30","2012-09-29","0.420000","-107","-43.85","Red","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-01-30","16:14:17"

MARCS is divided into a set of components. There are application and service components. The work flows in ORA will often cross multiple organizations and include a number of different user activity types such as screening, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, and compliance. The application components are designed to provide user groups with a one stop shop interface that will allow them to perform work from their user point of view. Functionality is only implemented once in a component. One user group work flow may use functionality from most of the MARCS components. This has implications for the management of MARCS. While the individual projects build out certain types of functionality, these need to be combined and coordinated into a whole in order to provide a useful work flow that covers the whole life cycle of a regulated product as it passes from one user group to the next. This combination and coordination needs to occur at the program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. PMTI includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI begins work on a release when it is time to start system integration testing.

It will be available on the standard FDA laptops. It will also be available on Remote Access Devices (RADs). RADs are handheld devices. A pilot will be conducted using Apple and Android products to prove out the expected ROI and determine a final RAD platform. This is the first time a RAD will be directly integrated with the FDA network, so a number of issues need to be resolved. In addition, functionality on laptops and RADs will be available in two modes: online and offline. An offline mode is needed as Field work is often done in remote locations with little or no connectivity. The technology that is being used to implement this is Sybase SQL Anywhere and Afaria. FWM 3 includes work to incorporate this technology and build up the FDA infrastructure to support this.","2011-09-23","2012-09-22","6.837000","0","0.00","Green","0.273000","3.99","Green","2013-08-01","14:59:01"

For EM, this will focus on migrating functionality from the legacy systems Operational and Administrate System for Import Support (OASIS) and Entry Review to support 801(a) screening. For ITACS, this will focus on account management (via Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS)) and additional functionality enabled by logins. For PREDICT, this will focus on building functionality to better manage rules. For PNM and CSI, this will focus on requirements. EM will provide functionality for screening, in conjunction with PREDICT, for the majority of the 20,000,000+ products imported via the 801(a) process annually. This will give import screeners and import compliance officers a unified interface for dealing with all of their work flows, including tracking Field Work (accomplished in Field Work Manager (FWM)). PREDICT is an expert system built around a rules engine that produces a risk-based score of imported products. Products with a low score are automatically sent forward by PREDICT. Products with a higher score require an import screener to review the product by using EM. ITACS is used to interface with import filers and industry to provide a conduit for supporting documentation. This will reduce the current use of phone calls and emails, provide FDA with a more reliable information source and record, and give industry a more efficient way of communicating. Use of this component by industry is voluntary, so it must provide an incentive for external partners. PNM will provide the interface for work flows associated with 801(m) import screening, Prior Notice, which is focused on Food Security and Food Safety. This will replace functionality currently in OASIS. CSI will replace the outdated technology currently used for the interface between FDA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Work for DSS, SERS, and NS focuses on final changes to fully conform to the new MARCS architecture. DSS currently provides for materialized views of Center databases in order to give MARCS users 24x7 access to this Center data. This may be expanded in the future for data sharing needs within FDA and with external partners. SERS provides a programmatic and user interface for the storage and retrieval of documents (including photographs, scanned items, and other evidence) to support the regulatory and legal requirements of ORA. NS provides automated communication via email and fax for use within FDA and with external partners. DLCMS, PS, and UWES will be built under SS. DLCMS will provide functionality for non technical government FTEs to manage reference data used to identify products and activities. Currently, this can only be changed by engaging technical personnel to adjust information in tables. PS will combine the best of breed of six separate legacy implementations for managing, searching, and updating regulatory product information. This information originates in the Centers, but is used by ORA in many of its work flows, so ORA needs a service to support the management and aggregation of this product information. UWES will use the COTS Oracle WebCenter product to provide a unified and consistent portal-like user experience across all of MARCS. The user view will be customized according to role.

The license expansion for the BPMS includes enough licenses for all FDA users. A number of FDA Centers have expressed interest in using this platform for their systems. MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences. OPA is a rules engine that will have a number of applications in MARCS ranging from inspection preparation, intelligent questionnaires, and import screening support. RUEI is a tool that can be used from a centralized location to determine the experience that an end user at a remote site is having. ORA is a geographically dispersed organization. In this sense, the user community for MARCS is different from Center user communities since the vast majority of users are not in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This tool will give ORA and OIM a new ability to understand what is actually happening at user sites and will enable a systematic approach towards improving performance and reliability in the Field.

In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established.   The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors.  Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy. FHA serves the needs of more than 20 Federal Agencies in domains as diverse as military and veterans' healthcare, public health monitoring, long-term care and disability services, research, tribal health services and many other critical Federal priorities.","2004-04-30","2018-09-30","74.574000","0","0.00","Green","0.706000","2.54","Green","2014-07-22","16:16:14"

The scope of this project is to (1) define an HHS-wide reporting strategy, and (2) to implement Oracle's Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) and address this business need for users of UFMS.  This project heavily leverages work performed by FDA on their OBIEE pilot.  This involved implementation of OBIEE Plus for use by approximately 50 seat licenses; configuration of extract, transform, and load (ETL) routines to load FDA data from UFMS and to address Oracle Descriptive FlexFields (DFFs); and enhancement and development of dashboards and reports to meet FDA specific business needs.  These configurations and enhancements can be adjusted to enable rapid development and delivery of a global UFMS data warehouse for use with OBIEE.  Program data can be integrated either through individual data warehouses for each set of books (SOB), or loaded into the single central warehouse.  While our preliminary analysis indicates a hybrid approach that shares a central financial data warehouse with OpDiv-specific program data warehouses as most likely the best fit architecture for OpDiv business needs, the detailed OBIEE needs assessment work that is being planned by the UFMS Program Management Office (PMO) will determine the specific details of the go-forward solution.  This solution seeks not only to improve reporting and decision support, but also to consolidate the large number of disparate reporting systems used across the Department that provide redundant capabilities today.  From an application architecture perspective, the dashboard and reporting solution will integrate with:*         Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) applications that form the COTS foundation of UFMS*         Consolidated Financial Reporting System (CFRS)*         The budget solution that is a part of this modernization program*         Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS)*         Other program data and warehouses with which the financial data will be tied to facilitate improved reporting and decision support.","2011-09-30","2014-05-31","10.950000","-667","-84.01","Red","0.194000","1.77","Green","2014-07-22","16:16:21"

The project includes incorporating additional functionality in the system that supports the lifecycle management of budgets - from formulation through execution.  However, as the HHS the Office of is in early planning stages seeking to implement the Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS) as a Department-wide budget formulation tool, this effort will focus on the budget planning through budget execution functions with an interface to DEBS and integration with UFMS.  Improvement in this area directly affects audit material weaknesses related to budgetary analysis,[1] such as reducing manual entries and facilitating compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA).  This also addresses a common sentiment among the user groups that UFMS is an accounting system rather than a financial management system.The Hyperion Performance-Based Budgeting Solution provides an enterprise-level solution for budget formulation, execution, and distribution, which eliminates the need for multiple spreadsheets, separate feeder applications, and numerous individual processes.  This will allow users to spend less time reconciling data and more time analyzing and planning, provides for more accurate reports to OMB, the ability to monitor and measure agency performance against agency goals, provides security and audit trails, and offers a variety of statements and reports.  This solution seeks to replace cuff systems that are currently used by budget staff across HHS agencies to meet the functionality gap that exists today.  From an application architecture perspective, the budget solution will integrate with:*         Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS) *         Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) applications that form the Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) foundation of UFMS*         Consolidated Financial Reporting System (CFRS)The Dashboard and HHS-Wide Reporting solution that is a part of this modernization program.","2011-09-30","2014-07-31","6.475000","-61","-22.34","Yellow","0.000000","0.00","Green","2013-03-19","11:10:00"

CTEP-ESYS tracks more than 27,000 patients per year in more than 24 disease areas. The system supports 517,000 drug orders and 37,000 registered investigators. Data reporting and analysis in real time is critical to ensuring adequate monitoring of the ongoing clinical research. Timely data reporting and analysis also assures effective planning for the required successor studies, thus accelerating the evaluation of promising new agents and regimens for patients with cancer. An effective CTEP-ESYS allows investigators and researchers to focus on scientific opportunity, patient safety and reducing the burden of cancer on the public by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. There are many components that support CTEP needs including protocol tracking, agent authorization and tracking, clinical data reporting, adverse event reporting and processing, clinical trials auditing, financial management, investigational new agent and development, disease management and tracking, annual report generation, regulatory activities, account management, investigator registration, reporting and analysis. CTEP-ESYS consist of a common repository that interfaces with suite of applications that are integrated and support the cancer-clinical trials infrastructure.","2009-02-01","2016-01-31","9.000000","0","0.00","Green","0.400000","4.44","Green","2013-05-24","13:58:43"

The number of quality measures to be included for 2012 is not established at this time.  There were 190 quality measures in 2011.  For 2012 there will continue to be multiple reporting options through claims and will continue to include measure groups.  The Physician Quality Reporting System will support multiple submission methods such as Electronic Health Record Registry and Group Practices Reporting Options (GPROs I and II).  It is anticipated that the incentive will be based, as in past years, on the total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the reporting period.Continuing in 2012, there will be the Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Initiative which is available for those EP's that are considered successful electronic prescribers (eRx-ers) as defined in the CMS eRx specifications.  As in 2011, both individual and selected GPROs may report on the eRx measure through claims, registries or EHR's.  Successful eRx-ers will potentially earn an incentive payment based on their total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the 12 month reporting period.  Currently successful electronic prescribers will not be eligible to receive an incentive under the eRx Incentive Program if they are also receiving an incentive under the Health Information Technology (HIT) Incentive Program authorized by the Recovery Act, enacted on February 17, 2009. Future rule making may further align the incentives programs. EP's that are not electronic prescribers will receive a penalty adjustment starting in 2012 based on the first 6 months of claims data submitted in 2011.  The eRx Initiative will provide Interim Feedback Reporting to EP's.  Measures and other data sources may be added for the 2012 Program Year to allow EP's options for successfully reporting the eRx measure for both the penalty and incentive programs.EP's may have the flexibility of expanding and adding additional hardship codes for exemption for all years.","2012-03-10","2014-06-30","82.240000","-62","-7.91","Green","-0.060000","-0.07","Green","2014-03-27","14:46:34"

By 2014, it is expected that an additional 16 million people will become eligible for Medicaid and CHIP as a result of the Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148 - Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). In order to implement the statute, CMS must provide for a mechanism to ensure timely approval of Medicaid and CHIP state plans, waivers and demonstrations and provide for a repository for all Medicaid and CHIP program that supplies data to populate  Healthcare.gov (sec. 1103) as well as other required reports. With these tremendous statutory changes in the Medicaid and CHIP programs, CMS will undergo a transformation from a reactive, mostly paper based processing entity to an active, electronic based program manager by automating and streamlining the current systems and processes.CMS is in the process of evaluating Medicaid systems currently operating, in order to build an enterprise architecture platform and data repository.  Ideally, CMS would allow for a single point of entry to access various program and operational data applications.  This effort will be implemented in phases over several years.  Phase 1 will provide for a Medicaid and CHIP Program data system (MACPro) accessed through a web portal/portlet that will automate the input and retrieval of data from the states related to the State Medicaid and CHIP Plans (including Demonstrations and Waivers).  This system will also support an efficient workflow for the review and approval of the State Medicaid and CHIP process. States will access this system and submit program information into structured data templates.  CMS staff will review the templates for compliance with federal statute, regulation and policy, provide feedback to the states and track/monitor the review and approval process.  Future project phasing will provide for the design, delivery and implementation of financial management programs and performance and quality metrics. CMS must meet a hard deadline for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. This system will be operational in phases with the eligibility, benchmark plans, demonstrations and waivers portions/modules to be implemented before December 30, 2013.","2012-02-24","2015-12-30","40.000000","-122","-18.18","Yellow","7.083000","25.22","Yellow","2014-05-27","16:18:41"

Several locations are managing local off-shoring for data backup and storage with the use of in-country applications, which have the potential for data loss in the event of a local disaster.  There is no readily available, reliable, or consolidated solution for data off-shoring and the need has been growing with the increased number of posts in high threat areas.  As such, the Data Off-shoring Project was chartered on March 8, 2011 by the Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM) and Bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs and South and Central Asian Affairs (NEA-SCA) to design and pilot a data off-shoring solution.  NEA-SCA has requested and volunteered to pilot the solution at select posts. The purpose of the Data Off-shoring Project is to design and pilot a solution that will enable the Department of State (DoS) to back up users' core data to a secure remote location in the event of an emergency.  Upon successful completion of the pilots, a separate project may be initiated for a larger scale data off-shoring deployment and transition to Operations and Maintenance (O&M).","2011-10-01","2016-09-30","19.500397","0","0.00","Green","1.613088","8.27","Green","2014-05-29","15:03:04"

This will allow the Department to provide more effective technical and user support at lower total cost, while maintaining strong control over security configurations and aligns with IT Strategic Plan, Goals 4.3: Green IT,  4.4: Life-cycle Management, and  4.5: Cyber Security. The project team will work with the Regional Bureaus and IRM Offices to evaluate the posts and potential hub locations to determine which services and resources could be regionalized. Depending on what is possible given the unique requirements and infrastructure at each post, regionalization could be implemented post-by-post or service-by-service. In support of the DoS' IT Strategic Plan, Goal 5.2: Centralized Shared Services, the long term strategy is to have the Department's ClassNet data and services consolidated into regional hubs within six to eight years, including planning, implementing, and transitioning to operations and maintenance.","2011-10-01","2019-03-31","9.526916","0","0.00","Green","0.372836","3.91","Green","2014-05-29","15:03:07"

This evaluation resulted in the joint DoS/USAID IT Transformation Initiative (ITTI), which would establish a combined IT service model at approximately 70 overseas locations where DoS and USAID have a presence. The transformed IT platform will be known as the Foreign Affairs Network (FAN). Aside from DoS, USAID is the single largest IT consumer at post; transforming the IT infrastructure of these agencies will yield significant cost savings, reduce duplicative services, and increase information sharing.  Following the transformation, this iteration of the FAN will be further leveraged to support collaboration and communication among all Federal entities assigned overseas under Chief of Mission authority.  Upon completion, the FAN, managed by the Department of State will provide IT infrastructure services to USAID at their missions abroad under the ICASS service model.  USAID's current networking will be migrated to a State Department platform including international communications.  USAID local support staff will also be combined with State's under the direction of State IT managers and reduced to the number determined optimal for the combined user base.  Asset ownership (workstations and servers) remain with USAID while operations and management responsibility will transfer to the State Department. However,  USAID's lack of involvement, input and multiple paused resulted transformation completion of only 8 posts for FY12-FY13 duration.","2011-10-01","2013-09-30","10.679922","0","0.00","Green","-0.022210","-0.21","Green","2014-05-29","15:03:07"

Further, the approach includes a lifecycle approval step where FIT reviews and compares an agency's migration proposal to the common services and products to verify the following:  (1) the agency's needs align with the common services and products; (2) the agency can offer support (e.g., regulatory, statutory) for any needs beyond the common services and products; and (3) any verified Services and Products gaps can be satisfied by one of the designated SSPs.

FIT captures and aggregates the measures reported by the SSPs in a reporting tool (or benchmarking tool) that aggregates the information as a government-wide benchmark.  FIT, Federal SSPs, and Federal agencies can use the benchmarking tool to compare the cost and performance of the Federal agencies financial management activities to the price and performance of the Federal SSPs.  The benchmarking tool is a web-based application with defined metrics based on seven financial management end-to-end business processes, including Procure-to-Pay and Bill-to-Collect.  The metrics are based on the price and performance of the aligned business processes of the Federal SSPs.  Examples of the metrics include price per invoice, statement of differences, on- time payments, discounts and interest paid.","2013-10-01","2014-09-30","0.325000","130","35.71","Red","0.134550","41.40","Red","2014-08-29","10:08:15"
