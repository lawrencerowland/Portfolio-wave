Adding the  Manage Program  allows us to properly report the costs of the on-going planning for the other tasks, and to properly report the status of the other milestones. Other significant change in this exhibit were the reduction in FTE costs resulting from a Congressional decision to limit pay increases for federal workers. Also a decision was made not to move 3.5 million in FY 13 to pay for enhancements to legacy systems because Next Generation services should begin deploying by that time. The new milestones no longer include milestones for Platform, or Functional Services.","","","","","","30.929980","2014-09-30","02/18/2011","08:53:31","2892"

This will allow for the standardization of the CBS operating system and hardware platform.  In 2005, the CBS Executive Board conducted a business case and initiated a CBS consolidation effort to standardize the CBS technology platform, including efforts to co-locate the CBS and its associated environments at a single location, the Census Data Center (CDC) in 2008.  However, this project was redirected as a result of changes in the Census Bureau s priorities due to unforeseen issues with the Decennial Census.  Several decennial systems were moved to the CDC resulting in a power supply issue that forced the CBS servers to move out of the CDC.   As a result, the bureaus stopped their migration efforts and reverted back to their respective data centers using their current infrastructures that were near the end of life and/or capacity.  For example, two bureaus (Census and NOAA) reverted back to operating on Tru64 Operating Systems for Alpha Server Platforms and HP support ends in December 2012.  If the equipment and operating system is not purchased, there will be a significant impact on the continuity of operations for DOC s financial system, significantly increase the risk of system interruption and security exposure over time.","","","","","","526.703182","2012-09-30","11/24/2010","09:17:27","2343"

The start date of the Build internal cloud environment - Phase I, Start Agile activities (e.g. sprints) for high value targets, and Start Agile activities (e.g. sprints) for IP5 initiatives - Phase I milestones were updated to reflect the intention to start work in May 2011 which will follow both the successful completion of the Develop and evaluate vendor prototype solution software milestone and additional progress on the Implement Architecture and Infrastructure 1.0 milestone. The start date of the Implement Architecture and Infrastructure 1.0 was updated to January 2011 to reflect the initial planning work by OCIO employees on this milestone. The start date of the Start Agile activities (e.g. sprints) for patent search capabilities - Phase I milestone was updated to Sept 2011 as this milestone is less time sensitive at this time compared to other milestones above which are more beneficial to the overall PE2E Program and Patent Corps in the next few months.

This new timeline, coordinated with the FAA provides adequate time for the FAA to finalize their system development for their IOC, which is also delayed until March 2016.Funding appropriated and approved in FY12 and FY13, respectively, represents a reduction of approximately 50% from planned program funding.  This reduction prevents NOAA from progressing towards meeting objectives for improved weather data and accuracy by postponing investments in improved numerical modeling and statistical guidance, weather research and development, human forecast tools, and forecast performance assessment.  In addition, there will be less investment and progress towards enhancing the consistency of weather forecast information through implementation of a single authoritative source capability.

The additional $54.8M funds includes supplemental FY 2010 made available in the USPTO Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-224) and FY 2011-2016 funds that were previously allocated to  Miscellaneous and General Expenses (MGE),  but included such IT-related items as telecommunication circuits. After the initial NSI baseline was submitted, further internal review resulted in additional supplemental and MGE costs being re-allocated to the NSI budget, to properly report them as IT expenses. This major increase resulted in significant changes to the estimated costs for many NSI milestones. Additional changes from the initial baseline include: (1) reducing FTE costs to account for a Congressional decision to freeze pay for federal workers in FY 11 and FY12, and (2) adding milestones for prior year programs that were not included in the initial baseline, but have incurred expenses in FY 11 that need to be reported.","","","","","","1584.399118","2017-09-30","02/17/2011","16:51:54","2881"

Because of these changes to the 4th Generation contract, the current approved system baseline needs to be re-baselined to track cost and schedule accurately for the FFP portion as well as the T&M portion of the contract.  Once this occurs then the NPDB-HIPDB Earned Value Management (EVM) monthly status report will illustrate cost and schedule variances that are more realistic and accurate. There is justification for continuation of the investment under the new baseline for the following reasons:1.     The current baseline is inaccurate and requires modification.  The current baseline was established over two years ago and remained within established parameters for that length of time.  As of May 30, 2010, taken as a whole, the project has a cost variance of only -2.64% - well within the allowed 10% variance.  However, due to the recently mandated requirement to track both Steady State (SS) and Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DME) separately, the DME portion has now slightly exceeded the -10% threshold.2.     The current baseline does not include several efforts that were unforeseen at the time the baseline was established.  Of major significance is a security enhancement that was mandated by HRSA after the baseline was in place and therefore was not contained within the budget at that time.  This enhancement, referred to as eAuthentication will provide for a significantly higher level of information security for the system as a whole by validating users at a higher level of assurance.  In addition, unknown at the time of the original baseline was the recently completed change necessitated by the implementation of Section 1921 of the SSA and upcoming changes implementing the merger of HIPDB data into NPDB required by ACA.3.     The NPDB-HIPDB contract has been modified to address these security improvements as well as these legislatively mandated requirements. Under the current contract, the system is continuously enhanced to meet legislative and other Government initiatives that reasonably fit the architecture, including expanding the database to include additional data elements and/or add new reports and client categories and functional enhancements.  All functional enhancements to the NPDB-HIPDB IT investment are logical progressions of the current system and undergo the scrutiny of a documented Configuration Change Management process.  The implementation of these enhancements will provide the following strategic, cost, and technical benefits to the Government and user community: 1. Strategic Benefits:   Improve service levels (i.e. response time, confidentiality, and IT security).   Increase accuracy.   Increase the ability of health care entities to manage risks inherent in their processes to more effectively utilizing the NPDB system. 2. Cost Benefits:   Eliminate or minimize paper forms and other labor-intensive activities.   Eliminate duplication between the Data Banks. 3. Technical Benefits:   NPDB-HIPDB enhancements represent leading edge improvements to health care information systems that will respond to legislative and security requirements, external market conditions, address industry health care accreditation standards and regulations, and provide increased value to its many customers.

Guidance received from HHS late in Q2'10 concerning ARRA spending necessitated re-scoping of several of the planned projects and acquisitions. Original planning for RPMS development projects was based on known high-level requirements and needs from IHS programs and application business sponsors. Once funded these projects underwent review, refinement, and requirements definition with input from the stakeholders.  The impact of these considerations has been that the IHS OIT has scaled back on the number and the size of RPMS development and deployment projects that can be expected to be completed during the ARRA timeframe and with ARRA funding.  Furthermore, we have restructured all program lines into which both ARRA and regularly funded RPMS work is categorized. The previous 8 functional areas of work have been revised down to 4 main strategic areas; Practice Management, Patient & Population Health, RPMS Core & Data Exchange, and Operations & Maintenance. FY2010 decreased from 124.492 to 109.496 to reflect a revised amount of 14.468 of RPMS ARRA planned expenses in FY2010; 14.996 of ARRA planned expenses moved to the IHS Infrastructure, Office Automation, and Telecommunications (IOAT) investment. FY2011 decreasing from 105.151 to 93.567 based on the removal of 24.307 of unrealized funding, continuation of the FY10 16.251 funding, and 4.000 of security costs shifted to the Security investment, including standard inflation rates. FY2012 increased to 93.567 to reflect the anticipated straight-line funding from FY11 to FY12. FY13-FY15 reflects an increase based on the revised FY2012 budget, plus a standard 2.2% inflation rate. FY16 reflects a continuation of the investment adding 102.077.","","","","","","1168.797000","2016-09-30","08/31/2010","16:09:24","1098"

During this time period, the FY2012 Reimbursable Agreement between OCSE and SSA for data center support was negotiated; based on changes to SSA cost reimbursement methodology, the FY2012 agreement cost to OCSE was significantly less than anticipated.  This is the primary change to the Summary of Funding Tables for FY2012 and beyond.  In addition, contract award fees were added to the Summary of Funding Totals based on updated reporting guidance. Additionally, the FPLS Management reviewed the initial FY2012 list of Projects, and made changes to this baseline based on budget decisions and internal priorities.  Two projects that were initially planned to start in late FY2012 were removed from the baseline completely.  Two additional projects, Move NDNH to Relational Database and IRG Interface for OCSE Web Redesign, were initially entered as a planning project.  The cost and schedule information for these projects was updated based on the baseline approved by the FPLS Strategic Planning and Oversight Board during the initiation phase, which occurred after the preliminary FY2013 Exhibit 300 submission.  The final project that underwent a baseline change, FSF Portal PIV Card Implementation required cost and schedule updates due to external dependencies on the final implementation.  These changes to overall project spending were also reflected in the Summary of Funding.

First, milestones must be adjusted to be consistent with the final operating budget numbers as well as to incorporate supplemental funding from MIP-D. Second, changes are necessary to be compliant with additional guidance to present milestones at a more granular level. The current FY 2011 baseline is comprised of the following: one year-long operations & maintenance milestone ($18,517,000 for 10/1/2010 to 9/30/2011); and one year-long project management milestone ($1,097,000 for 10/1/2010 to 9/30/2011).  The proposed FY 2011 baseline would be comprised of the following: two operations & maintenance milestones (one for web hosting, hardware, and software and a second for system operations and testing); two six-month milestones for the bid & formulary projects; and two six-month milestones for the marketing & audit projects.  The future milestones would also be updated to adhere to this new structure. Finally, the FY 2011 baseline would retain its existing project management milestone with an updated cost amount of $1,338,000 to reflect two new ACA hires.","","","","","","306.216000","2017-09-25","02/18/2011","10:29:08","2905"

"009-000005315","302","009","Department of Health and Human Services","FDA CDER MedWatch Plus","04/20/2011","Correction","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring the safety of FDA regulated products in order to protect and promote public health. Analysis of adverse event and safety report information is critical to achieving this goal. The FDA needs to modernize its aging systems, improve its analytic capabilities, and make it easier for the public to submit adverse event and safety reports to the FDA. This investment was comprised of two primary efforts: the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) and the public-facing reporting portal known as the Safety Reporting Portal (SRP-formerly known as MedWatch Plus Portal) and a unified core processing process/systems. FAERS will deliver the back-end application and database for data that supports post-market safety surveillance analysis for FDA regulated products. SRP and the core processing were to be the front-end, enabling a reporter to submit voluntary or mandatory reports to FDA on any regulated product. Core processing would provide services to ensure the data was complete and ready for analysis and public release. The MW+ investment was established with a broad scope that included all regulated products with many internal stakeholders and a very diverse set of business processes and needs. FDA conducted an internal assessment of the investment in late 2009. The assessment findings indicated that the project was too complex, difficult to manage, understaffed, and that the technical feasibility of a single system for all product types was questionable. It also noted that the current SRP concept depends on external factors for which FDA has limited control, including development and operation of the SRP system and questionnaires by the National Institutes of Health. Changes to the implementation approach include: FAERS and SRP are to be separated into two different investments FDA is shifting to a more outcome-focused operating model as recommended and has developed a FAERS schedule that will provide operational releases in 6 month intervals to establish a regular cadence of delivering outcomes. FDA has appointed a senior Lead PM, with 25+ years experience, as the single responsible person for the successful execution of the project. FDA has been transitioning from its current classic single-system, single-server architecture to a cloud architecture. The new FAERS will be implemented in the FDA Contractor Hosted Data Center in a private cloud environment, realizing operating cost avoidances.","","","","","","53.673000","2015-03-31","04/22/2011","10:09:55","3950"

This improved efficiency aligns with recommendations from the FDA Science Board. These changes to CDER/CBER FAERS resulted in a delay in retiring legacy AERS.  FY11 costs decreased due to incorrect updates in the Summary of Funding in the previous submission.  The Summary of Funding costs for FY11 now accurately reflect FY11 actual costs as previously reported to HHS and OMB. CDER/CBER FAERS -DQRS ProjectDue to the large number of changes, it was determined to be more efficient to deactivate the old project activities and replace with new ones.  In addition, the previous activities did not fully meet the requirements of the new Exhibit 300 format.  The new CDER/CBER FAERS baseline takes advantage of the new format by removing out-year planning activities that are not yet fully defined and by creating a new project for the next phase of development, which is to include DQRS functionality into CDER/CBER FAERS and retire the legacy system.CDRH FAERS ProjectCorrected FY13 FTE rate - reduced from $250,000 to $130,000 per FTEThe CDRH cost and schedule changes are attributed to re-evaluations and technological solution changes on the CDRH FAERS project due to product end of life cycle.  The CDRH FAERS team has completed an alternatives analysis of platform options and is pursuing an independent verification and validation (IV&V) step before making the final technology decision.  This change in technical direction has resulted in a 6 month schedule delay (production release scheduled for 3/13/2013 (estimated)), an increase in planning costs in FY12, and a decrease in development costs for FY12.  Previously reported development releases 5.0, 7.0, and 8.0 will be replanned after the IV&V is completed and a final technical direction is established.The increase in FY12 O&M costs is a result of an error in the original rebaseline resulting from a transposition of numbers in CDRH FAERS O&M cost.","3069,2148,2149","Projects, Activities, SoF","","","2008-2020","","","04/02/2012","09:25:29","7953"

These baseline changes are consistent with FDA direction, the expected path of the program, and with determinations made pertaining to individual projects by both ORA business and OIM IT.  Rebaseline Description:RBIS is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are four (4) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:Set 1: Rebaseline.  The following projects have a BCE rebaseline event: FDA ORA RBIS Data Availability (DA)FDA ORA RBIS Data Evaluation and Recommendations (DER)FDA ORA RBIS Data Quality (DQ) FDA ORA RBIS Firm Master List Services (FMLS) Enhancements FDA ORA RBIS Report Development Support (RDS)The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered. Additionally, the scope for the RBIS DA, RBIS DER, and RBIS DQ projects has changed, resulting in an increase or decrease to the project lifecycle costs that exceeds 10%.  The contractor has reallocated work between projects, which has resulted to changes in the scope of these projects and led to this variance.  The specific changes to the lifecycle costs of these projects are as follows: the budget of RBIS DA was increased from $1.104 million to $1.635 million.  The budget for the RBIS DER project decreased from $519,000 to $275,000.  The budget for the Data Quality (DQ) project decreased from $822,000 to $582,000.  The budget for the RBIS FMLS Enhancements project decreased from $417,000 to $316,000.  The budget for the RBIS RDS project increased from $1.841 million to $2.085 million.  The reason for the changes in the costs of the RBIS DA, RBIS DER, and RBIS DQ projects are as follows.  The DA project was intended to pick up later phases of work started under the RBIS Data Warehouse, Data Marts, and Universes (DWDMU) project.  The work accomplished under the DWDMU project led to a larger scope for DA than originally anticipated.  This resulted in an increase in the project's scope.  For the RBIS DQ project, the Contractor was able to leverage Dunn and Bradstreet (D&B) resources more than was originally planned, thus reducing the anticipated cost. The result was a decrease in project costs.  For the RBIS DER project, the contractor received a lower estimate from a subcontractor for work to be done under this project than was expected, resulting in a lower cost.   The project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost In the case of the RBIS FMLS Enhancements and RBIS RDS projects, the overall scope did not change even though the project costs increased or decreased by more than 10%, as is evident from the numerical information provided above.  This is due to primarily to costs associated with integration for FMLS and a higher than anticipated demand for report changes for RDS.  The costs for these projects required adjustment based on the more detailed activities, but the overall scope for each project has not changed and the project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost.Set 2: Replan.

The work accomplished under the DWDMU project led to a larger scope for DA than originally anticipated.  This resulted in an increase in the project's scope.  For the RBIS DQ project, the Contractor was able to leverage Dunn and Bradstreet (D&B) resources more than was originally planned, thus reducing the anticipated cost. The result was a decrease in project costs.  For the RBIS DER project, the contractor received a lower estimate from a subcontractor for work to be done under this project than was expected, resulting in a lower cost.   The project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost In the case of the RBIS FMLS Enhancements and RBIS RDS projects, the overall scope did not change even though the project costs increased or decreased by more than 10%, as is evident from the numerical information provided above.  This is due to primarily to costs associated with integration for FMLS and a higher than anticipated demand for report changes for RDS.  The costs for these projects required adjustment based on the more detailed activities, but the overall scope for each project has not changed and the project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost.Set 2: Replan.  The following projects have a BCE replan event: FDA ORA RBIS Center and External Integration (CER)FDA ORA RBIS Data Warehouse, Data Marts, and Universes (DWDMU) The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.

Rebaseline Description:MARCS is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are seven (7) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:Set 1: Rebaseline - change in funding strategy (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The  MARCS Investment is reduced by $4.729M in FY 13 as a result of the requirement from OMB to represent Data Consolidation and IT savings in budget authority (BA) as compared to the FY 2012 Enacted BA.  This cut has been reflected in the summary of funding table for MARCS for FY13.  The DME (excluding planning) costs have been reduced from $12.687M to $10.687M.  The O&M Costs have been reduced from $9.086M to $6.357M.  This is consistent with a recent review of MARCS that was conducted internally within FDA.  While this funding level is being reduced for FY13, the full scope of MARCS has not changed.  Thus, $2.729M is being placed into FY14 DME (excluding planning) costs to increase this from $7.630M to $10.359M and $2.000M is being placed into FY15 DME (Excluding Planning) Costs to increase this from $3.926M to $5.926M.  O&M spending will be constrained in order to emphasize new development in accordance with the FDA internal Technical Status review underway.  O&M cost reductions will be accomplished based on O&M task orders that control the number of releases per year and  defects addressed.Set 2: Rebaseline - change in scope (E300b, Section B - Projects).

The updates reflected two budget changes that occurred late in FY11, after the initial baseline change request had been approved. 1. The investment incurred additional, unexpected, costs of $1.292 M for Licenses.  This cost increase was reflected in the O&M for FY11, increasing that Prior Year O&M costs from $6.429 to $7.721.2. The Annual enhancement budget for the two reporting systems had been estimated at $690,000.  A Task Order requisition for needed enhancements was processed; however the vendor estimate was above the expected amount.  The Task Order was awarded at $777K at the end of September.  The FY11 DME was therefore increased by $87K  from $690,000 to $777K.  The combination of these two changes increased projected funding over the lifetime of the investment by $1.379M from $188.598M to $189.977M.  The Summary of Funding table was changed in December to reflect these actual costs for FY11.   However, the FY11 DME baseline activity associated with modifications and enhancements could not be changed to reflect the $87K  increase in funding because that section of ProSight was closed to changes in December.  The changes will be made if the new baseline is approved. These requested changes to the baseline will synchronize the DME activity funding with the Summary of Funding.

While the lifecycle costs were accurate in the Summary of Funding, the milestones that were identified in the existing baseline were out of variance for the cost and schedule.  In the new baseline, now being submitted, milestones have been added to correct this discrepancy through FY16. The current baseline did not accurately articulate a clear plan with achievable activities within milestones.  Start and end dates:  (FY2007-FY2016+) have not changed. This BCR is for a total lifecycle cost of $375.4M and the previous baseline was for $259.1M.

The previous scheduled planning period was used to select 10 high priority, high use data sources and a suite of analytic capabilities for Increment 1.  Increment 1 is now underway and is scheduled to go active during the first quarter of FY 2011.  This new effort required the diversion of $6.21M in hardware and additional personnel who normally support tactical response developments to this more strategic effort.  STAO also realigned other resources from other programs to support this new effort.  Because DIVS is a level-of-effort, government-led, government-contractor team program, additional financial resources are expected to be added to DIVS to maintain the pace of future data aggregation, provide sufficient storage capability, and maintain user expected system performance.  These changes will be shown in subsequent reports.  The program office is also developing plans for future increments, future functionality, requirements and risk managment processes, future infrastructure needs, cost estimates, and future system deactivations.  These plans will provide greater clarity during FY 2011.  This DIVS scope change is one of data and data source magnitude.  The purpose of DIVS is unchanged-store FBI lawfully obtained data and present that data  to authorized users via web-based software analytic applications.  OMB personnel were briefed on these changes on May 4 and 7 with a planned follow-on review in October 2010.","","","","","","289.102800","2015-09-30","06/01/2010","14:48:14","687"

This is part of the evolving design solution to accommodate larger amounts of data as more data sets are added to the system.  This monthly assessment also shows the $5M expected from the FY 2010 Supplemental and will be used for additional Storage Area Network (SAN) hardware to accommodate larger storage needs as the project goes forward.  All funding additions reflect scope change due to Presidential Memorandum and Director's decision to aggregate and federate all FBI investigative and intelligence data in DIVS. (NOTE:  DIVS is a level of effort costed program.  Also note that original baseline only captured contractor labor costs.  Requirements changes dictated the need o reflect hardware additions as a result of the change and not normal data growth, which reflected in O&M accounting).","","","","","","291.174800","2015-09-30","06/16/2010","14:41:16","719"

On August 3rd, DOJ approved an enhancement to the DIVS budget of $16.5M and 10 government positions to handle future needs and accelerate system build-up (more data sets and functionality faster). This new baseline reflects current planning and the new proposed funding, pending OMB and Congressional approvals. The planning period to define future increments is underway. FBI executive management is reviewing FY 2011 target content for DIVS in terms of new data sets and analytic functionality releases that can be accomplished within current funding over the next 12 months. DIVS will be planned, developed, and implemented incrementally with a 6-12 month window of in scope requirements for subsequent increments. Since DIVS is an operational mission support system, actual program content and accomplishments will evolve in response to threats, resource availability, technology, and user defined requirements and priorities. Funding and schedules will be adjusted as system solution discoveries are made and executive decisions on program content and resource needs are made. DIVS is following a dynamic and evolutionary development strategy-dynamic because the emphasis is on rapid capability improvements in response to various and evolving threats to national security. The fundamental purpose and scope remains unchanged; execution details will change (funding and milestones) to meet emerging needs. FBI leadership now desires quarterly releases and progress reviews, thus milestones will be adjusted once the corresponding dates ae determined.","","","","","","540.656000","2016-09-30","09/16/2010","16:55:51","1318"

As a result, milestone number 84 N-DEx Increment 3 4th Material Order, was deleted and set to Omit Synchronization in the FITDB.  The amount of this milestone was $1,159,000, and while we had applied an estimated actual cost to this milestone, no payment had been expended. The associated dollars were transferred to labor for Milestone #83 N-DEx Increment 3 Submission of Iteration 2-RCR/DCR/PDR/CDR Workoff.  This milestone planned cost increased from $425,000 reported in the February FITDB to $1,491,000 in March.  The holdback does apply to the labor transfer, thereby increasing milestone number 92 N-DEx Increment 3 Final Term Option Year 2 QASP Evaluation Settlement from $667,000 reported in February to $759,000 in the March FITDB.

To accomplish this, Secretary Solis has formulated a series of strategies for reforming worker protection at the Labor Department With new challenges and new directions there has been a redirection of system scope and functionality to better align the OIS with the Department of Labor's recently released Strategic Plan and the Secretary Solis outcome goals.To accomplish these goals OIS system requirements need to be modified and enhanced to address the revised functionality.  For example, OSHA's methodology for penalty calculations for violators of occupational safety and health rules and regulations has been significantly modified and therefore the OIS has been redesigned to capture and accurately calculate these important changes.  Another example of significant functionality change is the addition of a new critical agency program called the Severe Violators Enforcement Program (SVEP). Similar redesign of the OIS has occurred to incorporate this new and important program.Also, data migration and data cleansing of OSHA's legacy occupational safety and health data has incurred considerably greater resources to accomplish.  One of the goals of the new OIS is to provide more accurate historical occupational safety and health data to the public, to other Executive Branch departments, and to the Congress.As a result of the new challenge, new directions, requirement updates, architecture modifications and additional training requirements for the key stakeholders, OSHA senior management understands that OIS needs additional funding as well as an adjustment to the deployment schedule. The impact of these changes has caused the life-cycle costs to go from $84 million to $91 million.  These factors have also resulted in the additional funding of $3.1 million for FY10 and 11, as well as the need to increase federal resources in FY11 and out years. In addition, the BY12 and out years reflect an increase in FTEs based on the organizations need to manage OIS increased functionality.  The deployment schedule will be adjusted from October 2010 to March 2011","","","","","","86.130160","2017-09-29","01/14/2011","14:20:18","2625"

These reasons are as follows: Milestone 43 for O&M year 7 has been deleted as no funding has been allocated for that task for that year as yet. Milestone 32 was erroneously stated to be 100% complete while the task is still in progress. Hence it was changed to 99% to reflect the correct progress. The cost has been updated to reflect the level of ongoing effort. Milestone 26 comprised of two tasks. Hence milestone 26 has been split to reflect the separation of tasks. The EA portion of the task has been designated as a separate milestone (#47) Since milestone 26 and associated tasks have been split into two separate tasks and milestones, (#26 and #47) the cost of level of effort has also been split to reflect the cost of each task without altering the initially planned total cost.

In September 2011, SOL awarded an Evidence Management Initiative (EMI) contract to IE Discovery, Inc to provide both litigation support services and a cloud (or cloud-like) IT system that allows evidence sharing capabilities to DOL's staff nationwide.  Following award, the vendor worked with The Office of the Solicitor (SOL) to conduct detailed project planning and provide cost and schedule estimates based on the scope of work.  These estimates are to replace the pre-award projections and add accuracy and detail to the EMI portion of the master schedule.     The Matter Management Initiative (MMI) portion of the investment is currently well into the development and testing phase of the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  This project recently encountered a number of delays due to application-level security vulnerabilities, and has modified its schedule to remediate these issues and mitigate future problems.  Following rebaseline the investment's Integrated Master Schedule will reflect current activities, durations, costs, and timelines to be used for proactive management and performance reporting on both EMI and MMI.","524,525","Projects, Activities","","","2009-2018","","","08/09/2012","15:22:23","8927"

In July 2008, the contractor was issued a stop work order and the contract was subsequently terminated.  As part of the corrective action plan OWCP/DEEOIC has procured new contractors to complete the project. The IBR was completed on January 5, 2011, by the new contract team and Federal Project Managers.  During the interim, OWCP - ECS has been operating on a Programmatic WBS in anticipation of applying for a re-baseline. This rebaseline request reflects a delay in completion of the system from its original projected finish in FY 2009 to early FY 2012 (based on the original baseline).","","","","","","235.089753","2020-09-30","07/29/2011","13:45:39","6747"

The ISRP workstation refresh was authorized, funded and initiated last June (2010) and completed in December 2010. Due to a variety of reasons, ISRP was initially confined to reporting the FY10 costs of the Workstation Refresh against the existing FY10 Operations and Maintenance milestone, and the residual FY11 costs against the existing FY11 Operations and Maintenance milestone until such time as the new Workstation Refresh milestone could be added to the milestone plan in February 2011. By then, ISRP was locked into adding the new milestone reflecting the full, original estimated cost even though most of the actual costs had already been expended and reported in FY10. Once the Workstation Refresh BCR was uploaded to the OMB IT Dashboard in February 2011, ISRP reduced its FY11 Operations and Maintenance milestone actual costs by the amount that had been expended this FY on the workstation refresh and reported those costs ($218,496) against the newly added Workstation Refresh milestone. The changes being made with this correction BCR (a) correct (reduce) the actual costs of the FY10 Operations and Maintenance milestone by the amount of the FY10 workstation refresh actuals, (b) corrects the Workstation Refresh start dates, and (c) corrects the total actual cost and the actual percent complete for the Workstation Refresh milestone.","","","","","","241.944000","2017-09-30","05/13/2011","14:40:49","6016"

Last summer when we were building our BY13 Exhibit 300 (E300), there was uncertainty as to how ACA was going to work. Our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) organization issued control charts that did not contain ACA funding saying FY2012 and FY2013 do not include ACA since we do not have the status/treatment of that program at this time. ISRP expected to do some work in support of ACA and, with the expectation they would be receiving ACA funding at some point, we created a $20K place-holder project in our E300 for ACA-related tax form changes. Then, this past January (2012), our CFO issued updated control charts depicting ACA funding being pulled out from various Exhibit 53 line items and consolidated under ACA with a transmittal message saying that the ACA funding was being consolidated. Once we realized that ISRP was not going to receive any ACA funding, the ACA place holder project in ISRP's E300 should have been removed. Based on this explanation, ISRP is now seeking Treasury's support for this Correction BCR to remove the ACA project from ISRP's baseline. We need to get this processed before our BY14 E300s are submitted to OMB so that this project isn't erroneously perpetuated in ISRP's baseline next year.","2776","Projects, Activities","","","","","","08/29/2012","16:00:33","9045"

In FY 2009 Treasury management and IRS management agreed to a single steady-state milestone for the purposes of the FY 2011 OMB Exhibit 300 submission because IRS was in the early planning stages.  The purpose of this baseline change is to establish more accurate life cycle costs and to expand the original place holder milestone with a more complete milestone plan to include activities which start in FY 2011 and FY 2012, and the milestone activities end in FY 2013.  Note: the complete lifecycle and additional milestones for this project will be 10 years.

Therefore, it is estimated that this project will be delayed until FY13.- Removed DME 4 - Contract Writing System - The contract for the new Procurement Contract Writing System was awarded to our current vendor (Compusearch).  Therefore, the milestone for transitioning to a new procurement/contract writing system is no longer required.- Added a Consolidated DME as these components are being managed as one project which includes:  a. DME 1 (R12)  b. DME 3 (Oracle Projects Module)  c. Removed costs associated with US Mint core financial system upgrade to R-12 due to customer requested delay.  d. Added estimated costs associated with US Mint SaaS project integration.In addition, the reductions to the original DME#1 reflects a delay in the US Mint instance upgrade due to a new US Mint priority (the US Mint has requested our assistance in integrating a new Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) solution for their Integrated Retail Information System (IRIS) with our Oracle E-Business Suite).  This was identified by US Mint as their highest priority and thus we have delayed upgrading their core financial system until this project is completed (currently expecting FY13).","2913","Projects, Activities, Metrics","","","2010-2020","","","02/13/2012","14:40:13","7362"

"015-000000004","542","015","Department of the Treasury","Payment Application Modernization (PAM)","01/27/2011","Rebaseline - change in scope","Investment Description:  The Payment Application Modernization (PAM) project is an effort to standardize and modernize 30+ current mainframe based software applications that are used by the four FMS Regional Financial Centers (RFCs) and Debt Management Service (DMS) center to distribute approximately 1 billion federal payments annually. Reason for Baseline Change:  The business need for this interim BCR centers around changes in requirements and scope experienced during Production Release (PR) 3.0 including: 1) deferring the Office of Personal Management (OPM) payments from PR 3.0 and replacing with daily payments that include travel, salary and vendor, 2) changes to the Business Process Model implemented in PAM to support the variations needed for daily payments and the new standard input file format, 3) a mandate to implement certificate requirements to support Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2), 4) development of post PR 3.0 roadmap to align with key Treasury initiatives,  5) the decision to move the application development/maintenance to the FRB resulting in the termination of  knowledge transfer activities, and 6) reporting requirements detailed in OMB M-10-25, Reforming the Federal Government's Efforts to Manage Information Technology Projects.FMS anticipates submitting another BCR within 6 to 8 months due to a possible mandate to agencies to use a standard format that will position agencies to accommodate Government Wide Accounting reporting requirements (Treasury Account Symbol/Business Event Type Code) on their detail payment records. Additionally, FMS has finalized a decision to re-purpose the Austin Financial Center (AFC) into a Debt Management Operations Center.  This will result in redistributing the AFC payment workload to the remaining three Regional Financial Centers. In addition, the inclusion of the TOP Control System (TCS) re-write effort as part of the Operation and Maintenance of RO Legacy Applications will impact the current baseline. Finally, Information Resources' (IR's) availability to support a needed upgrade of the existing DataStage product may present impacts as well due to competing  priorities and the impending release of plans for the Regional Operations Center (ROC) relocations and other Fiscal IT issues. Current vs. New Functionality:The Payment Automation Manager (PAM) application provides functionality for processing Treasury Disbursed Office (TDO) payments on behalf of FMS and Federal Program Agencies (FPAs).","","","","","","190.099598","2016-08-31","02/16/2011","13:33:20","2820"

In order for PAM to be ready for the SSA and IRS transition, additional functionality that was not planned in FY 2012/2013 must now be included.  To accommodate the additions to scope, functionality originally planned must be deferred to a release beyond 2012.Implement RAD in FY 2013.  This causes a change in milestone naming convention and release schedule dates.Current vs. New Functionality:   Current PAM functionality allows agencies to send check and ACH payment requests in a standard format for IAT, PPD and CCD+ payments. PAM is a configurable application that allows the addition of the majority of agencies to process payments without making programming changes to the application.  PAM functionality will continue to be developed and implemented to meet the mandate to have functionality in place to accommodate GWA TAS/BETC reporting completed by the end of CY 2012.New 2012 functionality not in current baseline consists of 1) Generic Types of Payment Configuration Changes; 2) OFAC Screening for International Direct Deposits; 3) Agency Notification configuration moved to the RFC, Agency, and Type of Payment; 4) SSA Notification of check/Trace Numbers; 5) Redirection of Foreign Certifications to ITS.gov; 6) Debt Screening; and 7) Configure file size for TOP.Current vs. Proposed Schedule:Currently, the PAM baseline has DME activity ending on June 28, 2013 and Operation and Maintenance releases concluding on May 2, 2014. With the approval of this BCR, DME activity will be extended out to November 7, 2015. The extended development time will enable PAM to implement the additional functionality it needs to meet the new scope of the project. PAM is anticipated to reach full O&M in 2017, and costs are now projected through 2022.","3223,3225,3227,3229,2780,1145","Projects, Activities","","","","","","07/02/2012","12:05:22","8679"

This significant external event impacted ASAP's ability to deliver scope within the time frames and costs published internally to approving governance boards and externally in the Ex. 300b.

This results in the depositing of funds in the Treasury. The Gateway replaces a number of unnecessarily duplicative solutions in favor of a single, dedicated application. In so doing, the Debit Gateway benefits agencies by providing better service, and benefits FMS by doing so at a reduced cost. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) operates the Debit Gateway as Fiscal Agent.The Debit Gateway relies on commercial off-the-shelf software from the vendor U.S. Dataworks as its core. Custom code allows this COTS product to support Treasury's unique collection. Core maintenance and custom code development are currently the vendor's responsibility under contract to FRBC. In response to the vendor's financial difficulties (and, secondarily, concerns with the vendor's custom code development performance), the decision was taken in January 2012 to transition development responsibility to FRBC over a 12-18 month period. This transition will result in increased costs in FY12 and FY13 as FRBC adds resources, but ultimately produce savings once completed due to lower resource costs vs. the current vendor. Current baseline and proposed Debit Gateway lifecycle costs ($ mil.):FY12 $11.721, Proposed $12.393, Change +5.7%; FY13 $10.743, Proposed $11.790, Change +9.8%; FY14 $10.553, Proposed $9.932, Change -5.9%; FY15 $11.065, Proposed $10.546, Change -4.7%; FY16 $11.213, Proposed $9.474, Change -15.5%; FY17 $10.586, Proposed $9.572, Change -9.6%; FY18 $10.012, Proposed $9.282, Change -7.3%. Total FY12-18: $75.893, Proposed $72.990, Change -3.8%.A delay in implementing R1.4 (Adjustments, Corrections & Reversals) due to a high number of defects in vendor-delivered code has resulted in a need to delay the start and implementation of R1.5 (NACHA Rules). Delaying R1.5 permits full resource concentration on R1.4 defect correction in order to implement in production by 6-30-12. Further, the schedule for R1.6 (EFTPS) in FY13 will also change as a result before getting back to the planned schedules for Releases 1.7 (Same-day ACH processing) and 1.8 (Straight-through processing).","3251,2745","Projects, Activities","","","2008-2018","","","07/31/2012","23:11:02","8857"

While the two projects hit their cost targets, we initially failed to consider how the large volume of changes would affect our user community.  We chose to extend deployment to alleviate the impacts to our users rather than impact them with multiple changes all at once.  In the future, we will ensure that there is limited overlap between projects that affect the user community directly and allow for significantly more time when deploying functionality directly to them.  We held a bureau level TechStat on February 22, 2012, which identified the following issues in our planning process:-We realized the complexity of OTS integration as it became more apparent that the dates for deploying Blackberry devices and MIPS had to be moved out to accommodate higher priority integration issues.  We learned that going forward we will need to add additional time to our project plan for projects dealing with end user groups.  -Brief multiple integration stakeholders early in the project planning process to discuss similar projects across ITS to promote awareness.-Improving oversight and ensure completion of the project on schedule and within cost.Therefore, we are requesting approval of this baseline change request to reflect the conscious decision to delay deployment.Also added the total to the Target CY for the Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) Availability metric and updated the comment sections of the metrics.","1146,2778","Projects, Activities, Metrics","0.080000","","","","","04/19/2012","12:47:19","8021"

However, the EVM trend information has indicated that select projects are trending towards exceeding those thresholds. FinCEN performed an internal program review and confirmed that the BSA IT Mod technical architecture remains sound. However, based on the detailed projects review and lessons learned, there needs to be some schedule adjustments and cost realignment. One key lesson learned that is causing some of the milestones to be extended is moving from a waterfall approach to testing to a more iterative approach. FinCEN is now designing/building the system of record by BSA form then performing unit test on each form type before developing the next form. This iterative approach in the development and testing will help ensure all the business rules and data mapping is done correctly prior to data conversion.  Because of the dependency on the system of record, the Query system milestone has also shifted by two months, plus the project requires additional time to build a staging area to load all of the BSA data prior to populating the Query system. E-filing Release 2 has been broken up into three iterations, with the first being complete in December with the final dynamic or wizard version of the new SAR and CTR being complete in June 2012. The three projects that make up the Broker Information Exchange capabilities (Financial Intelligence Repository, Contact/Customer Management, and 314b) have been combined into one milestone because they will most likely share the same technology platform.  Moreover, the milestone date has shifted by one quarter in FY13 because of the budget allocation by fiscal year.Another reason for the BCR is to realign costs.  Some milestones have been complete and came in under cost, so these costs have been shifted to other, ongoing projects. Also, after a year into the Program, further cost estimating has been performed and subsequent refinements need to be made. However, there is no overall increase in the investment dollars.","","","","","","250.323213","2020-04-30","07/20/2011","16:13:33","6421"

The start date will be delayed from FY 11 Q1 to FY FY11 Q3 due to several key business factors:  1) The Western STRIPES implementation project has taken longer than initially scheduled but will be completed by April 2011; 2) Several key preparatory initiatives for BIDSS and interfaced systems could be completed before the BIDSS II project begins, lowering risk by reducing complexity of the upgrade; 3) The preparation, solicitation, and award of the consultant contract supporting the BIDSS II upgrade will not be completed until mid-2011; 4) Additional project analysis and planning is being done to ensure that the BIDSS II project, including the project schedule, is business value driven. Therefore, to reflect this delayed start, changes need to be made in the Cost and Schedule Performance Table, specifically start dates for FY11 milestones.

The rationale for the FinRS rebaseline follows: Redefined and re-prioritized the FinRS components based on critical Agency needs. The new approach reduces risk for the overall investment, phases the components to better meet the changing business environment, achieves value to the Agency incrementally versus at the end of a lengthy implementation process, and adapts to the maturity of available technologies.","","","","","","1726.548199","2015-12-31","10/14/2010","14:24:39","1807"

During the development of BY2013 E300 Process, CDX set a Planned Budget which was reviewed and approved by OEI IMO and EPA CPIC Offices and submitted to OMB. However, due to agency budget changes, the available budget for CDX BY2013 activities was reduced drastically from the Planned Budget. Continuing Resolutions delayed the release of the final Enacted Budget numbers preventing CDX from revising the Exhibit 300 during the available resubmission windows. This has resulted in CDX reporting monthly against the higher Planned Budget amounts. CDX requests initiation of re-baseline in order to align Planned costs for Project Activities with the revised Enacted budget. CDX will complete this re-baseline by updating the Project Activities Table in eCPIC with revised estimates for Planned and Projected Costs. Current Planned Costs, which were derived from the Planned Budget, will be downwardly revised proportional to the reduction in available funds issued in the Enacted Budget. These changes will be made simultaneously with the July 2012 IT Dashboard Update.","1543,1544","Projects, Activities","","","2001-2017","","","07/31/2012","12:08:28","8795"

The new baseline is needed to correct a life cycle cost error and adjust milestones due to a change in scope. O&M costs were understated for FY2014 through FY2017 by $20.1M. The EPA major system, Superfund Document Management System (SDMS), is being integrated into SEMS a year sooner than originally planned. The change impacts project cost and schedule, resulting in an earned value variance greater than five percent. Through the rebaselining, SEMS will realign milestones to better represent enhanced requirements definition for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) integration portion of the effort. This will result in a more streamlined development process. Funding adjustments correlate to the changes of schedule as the overall project costs are estimated in more detail. The rebaseline reflects a significant alteration to the scope of the SEMS project by accelerating the schedule to integrate a major subsystem, the SDMS into the SEMS a year sooner than originally planned, from FY2011 to FY2010. Project costs will show an increase for the reasons stated in the change rationale. Systems operation and maintenance costs were calculated inaccurately for FY2014   2017 in the previous business case submission and have been updated. The rebaseline will not affect the final planned delivery date of SEMS. There are realignments to the project milestones which will better integrate project scope. The SEMS schedule is changing in two ways. First, the integration of the SDMS major system is being advanced by one year to occur completely within 2010. Second, SDMS milestones are being combined into the Operations and Maintenance milestone of SEMS. Even though portions of the schedule are being advanced, the overall development portion of the project holds to the same completion date in 2013. Realignments of milestone dates and funding will permit a smoother transition forward on a project that is accelerating key subsystem integrations.","","","","","","58.943973","2017-09-30","03/09/2011","11:40:42","3751"

However, since the replan included correcting Project data and several Planned and Actual fields, the ITDB schema would only allow this submission to be classified as either a Correction or Rebaseline.  The changes reflected in the project and activities table do not constitute a rebaseline as defined by FAA's baseline management policy.  The program received approval for an extensive replan due to 1) GEO WAAS satellite failure in FY10; 2) regaining control of GEO satellite; 3) return of service in March 2011; 4) underestimation of the scope of work of software development of the G-III reference receiver.  The schedule replan is required to ensure the continuity of current services to WAAS users in concert with the implementation of planned enhancements.  Changes to planned activity completion dates for Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) milestones have been made consistent with the Baseline Management Notice (BMN) briefed to the FAA's Joint Resources Council (JRC) in April 2012.  The updated APB has been signed by Air Traffic's Vice President of Program Management. Completed activities were corrected consistent with the updated APB and to allow future performance to have more meaning for this reporting period. No long term impact on program cost or schedule is anticipated.","1194,1195,1196,1197,1198,1199,1200,1201,1202","Projects, Activities","75.223000","","","","","05/31/2012","15:21:55","8343"

However, since the replan included revising Project data and several Planned  fields, the ITDB schema would only allow this submission to be classified as either a Correction or Rebaseline.  The changes reflected in the project and activities table do not constitute a rebaseline as defined by FAA's baseline management policy.  As part of sound project management, planned costs for TMA Activities are risk-adjusted.  Risks for a number of Activites completed to date in FY12 did not materialize, and so these Activities were completed well below their Planned Cost.  This unused risk reserve was allocated to future Projects/Activities based on increased risks from interdependencies with external programs. The program's total planned cost of projects in FY12 only decreased by 1.8%.  This replan reflects the funding to which and within which the program is managing.  No impact to long term program costs or schedule are anticipated and the program baseline remains the same.","449,450,453,454,455,457","Projects, Activities","","","","","","05/31/2012","15:21:56","8345"

RWSL completed a JRC approved re-baseline in January 2010 that resulted in slight scope and funding changes. The RWSL Program received an Initial Investment Decision on July 18, 2007 from the FAA's Joint Resources Council (JRC). On June 25, 2008 the program received a conditional Final Investment Decision to procure and install systems at 22 airports and 3 support sites (2nd level engineering Program Support Facility, FAA Depot, and FAA Academy).  The conditional FID included approval to proceed with a prime contract award with a lifecycle cost baseline of $247.7M in F&E and $4.3M in Ops and a schedule baseline of FY08 to FY12. The JRC granted a FID to the RWSL program, on January 20, 2010, with a revised lifecycle cost baseline of  $367.7M in F&E and 105.5M in Ops, and a revised schedule baseline out to  FY16.

STIP utilizes Firm Fixed Price contracts for development efforts and therefore will not incur additional costs as the result of the schedule slips.  Rebaselining the current data will allow the Program to accurately track and report on its projects, and provide improved cost and schedule data for project milestones.  Additionally, STIP has implemented the use of an Integrated Master Schedule to manage its projects.  This has resulted in improvements in scheduling and forecasting project resources, and enables forward planning such that additional schedule slips do not occur.  Lastly, as part of the rebaseline, STIP will be able to implement and track accurate and realistic performance targets.  This will improve DHS's ability to monitor the performance of STIP as a system, and accurately reflects the current environment.","372,373,374,375,376,377","Projects, Activities, Metrics","16.303000","","2005-2020","","","07/30/2012","14:18:43","8773"

Since that date, and through the means of progressive elaboration, the team has refined the technical refresh scope, cost and schedule plans.  This refined data is captured in the 2/14/2011 rebaseline activity. 2) The Coast Guard and DHS recognize the importance and value of OMB's 25 Point Implementation Plan to reform Federal Information Technology Management dated 12/9/2010.

Planned investment projects have been re-scoped and some costs initially projected for FY 2013 have been moved to the out-years, thus, changing the funding amounts previously reported in prior Exhibit 300s. In addition, overall DHS budget reductions have resulted in an overall reduction to the O&M data in this year's summary of funding.In the Project Execution Tab's Activities Table, row 15 was deactivated and row 16 was elevated to a parent activity. Item 23 was the parent activity of child activity(s) directly following those line items. These changes are per Reporting Parent and Child Activities (WBS Structure) instruction. In addition, agency-submitted cost and schedule information is not required for parent activities. These line items may change and be renumbered when/if the IMS Help Desk removes the deactivated lines.Funding for the Data Center Migration (DCM) initiative has been removed from the Summary of Speding table, as well as other places of this Exhibit, per DHS guidance at the CAG Meeting (2/21/2012). Funding for DCM is being tracked by DHS, and it instructued its components to remove associated dollars to avoid potential double-counting. However, the ICE IT Infrastructure (Atlas) Program is still overseeing the Data Center Migration activities for ICE.","38,39,40,41,42","Projects, Activities, Metrics","","","","","","02/26/2012","09:18:12","7500"

This program has not gone through ADE 2A / IRB review and is not baselined as of 2/8/11.  ADE 2A / 2B review is currently planned for May 2011. All milestones beyond FY11 are generic in nature. The eHR Program is using a SOO based acquisition strategy to acquire non-developmental COTS/GOTS/SaaS solution with no customization.  IHSC (business client) has identified the critical or essential minimum functional requirements for the desired solution that vendors must provide (approx 650 out of 2,000+ requirements).  Remaining functionality will be allocated across software releases based on IHSC priorities and available funding.  Until the actual COTS/GOTS/SaaS product is selected and baseline functionality determined, the EHR PM is unable to allocate functions to specific releases beyond the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) and therefore has placed generic milestones in the schedule.  As the program proceeds and functions are allocated, these milestones will be updated.","","","","","","207.146000","2020-09-30","02/23/2011","10:20:18","3076"

These events along with the DHS requirements for shorter, more descriptive milestones left us with the opportunity to make changes that would not only be easier to track due to shorter milestone lengths but also much easier for the Project Managers to determine the dollar allocations toward milestones on their projects based on the contract fiscal year.  The PMO support team also discovered financial data that had not been incorporated into actuals for closed milestones from 2008/2009.  This required the modification of planned and actual dollars for milestone #1. The modifications made caused minimal change in the overall scope of CAII and its projects, no change in the overall planned dollar for the full lifecycle of the program occurred, and there were minimal schedule changes on the individual project level. A few reasons for the rebaseline:- The development of ACRIMe release 2.0 has fallen behind.  Due to this schedule delay ACRIMe has modified their mix of resource and the deliverables have changed or been extended.  - Secure Communities priorities have focused SDS resources to work on ACRIMe development deliverables.  This has caused the SDS dates and costs to be slightly re-planned.  - ATP milestone descriptions were changed to allow the PM to easily and accurately report on all costs.","","","","","","96.928000","2018-09-30","02/24/2011","08:47:48","3134"
"024-000005395","836","024","Department of Homeland Security","ICE - Criminal Alien Identification Initiatives (CAII)","01/20/2012","Rebaseline - other","Over the last several months, ICE/OCIO has been instituting changes to the ACRIMe Modernization project to counter significant issues in requirements gathering, poor developer performance and inadequate contract control and project management processes that have led to schedule and cost overruns. OCIO has assigned new project and portfolio managers in the last 12 months, has hired a new development contractor and strengthened contract controls. The ACRIMe Modernization project has also shifted its development methodology from a waterfall to Agile methodology, co-locating system users with developers leading to direct interaction that is key to proper product development. Functionality is being built in much smaller modules, leading to a vastly increased number of releases. A much tighter relationship with the business owner has led to a reprioritization of the releases, enabling the ACRIMe project to provide greater business value earlier than initially planned. To assist with greater flexibility in development of both the ACRIMe and Status Determination Services projects, ICE/OCIO is in the process of developing new contract vehicles that will enable it to more rapidly issue short task orders to develop modules of the larger applications. Delays in the procurement process have added to the schedule overruns, necessitating additional slippage in the overall ACRIMe Project schedule. The schedules initially placed into the project execution tab were the best plan available when the CAII OMB 300 schedule was developed. The changes made reflect changes in project prioritization, functionality needs, and expectations of contract vehicle availability. Even though project schedules have been extended, overall costs are expected to remain within +/-8% of original estimates, largely due to shorter development cycles and savings generated through tighter integration of developers with business users.","55,57,56","Projects, Activities, Metrics","","","2008-2018","","","02/26/2012","09:16:16","7498"

"027-000000052","872","027","Office of Personnel Management","USA Staffing System","02/27/2011","Rebaseline - change in funding strategy","The USA Staffing Program requests approval to change the IT Investment baseline for USA Staffing to ensure that the cost, milestones and performance measures most precisely reflect future plans.  This change in baseline will best reflect the direction of the USA Staffing program based on the most recent trends in Federal hiring, the latest information about customer needs, and growth in the USA Staffing customer base.  The FY12-FY16 cost projections have increased to reflect a growing USA Staffing customer base.  The USA Staffing program has seen unprecedented growth within its customer base over the last year.  In FY11, USA Staffing expanded it scope to include an enterprise-wide agreement with the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.  In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs expanded its use of USA Staffing to include Merit Promotion Hiring.  As a result, USA Staffing is processing between 500,000 to 600,000 employment applications each month.  This growth in the USA Staffing program necessitates broader SS activities in FY12 and beyond to ensure sufficient infrastructure to support a government-wide customer base.  The Exhibit 300 was updated to reallocate DME costs to SS to more accurately reflect the nature of operation and maintenance activities.  USA Staffing is a mature, stable system that is fully operational within 51 Federal agencies.  The USA Staffing system has maintained continuous operability, availability, and cost-recovery status for more than 10 years.  The changes were made to reflect a greater understanding within the USA Staffing Program Office on regulations and policies within Exhibit 300 and Exhibit 53.  The changes are a more accurate picture of our current state and contain metrics that are more appropriate and consistent with DME and SS operations for a mature system fully operational system.  The changes also reflect the need to build infrastructure overtime to adequately support a significant expansion of the USA Staffing customer base. With an expanded customer base, USA Staffing is able to further distribute its fixed costs creating government-wide efficiencies and cost savings.  As a result, USA Staffing will retain its current pricing in FY12. There are no contract implications associated with the rebaseline as USA Staffing is managed primarily with Federal employees and individual contractors.  USA Staffing revolving fund agreements will cover all planned expenses. ","","","","","","179.027000","2016-09-30","02/27/2011","11:21:18","3532"

OPM used a separate Earned Value Management (EVM) tool and process to closely manage investments that spend money in development of new functionality.  The FY2011 Continuing Resolution has impacted EHRI customer agencies' ability to fund new eOPF implementations under EHRI's fee-for-service funding model. As a result, several agencies that were planned for FY2011 have not moved forward and have to be removed from EHRI's baseline.  These agencies include the Department of Defense, Department of Interior, and the Department of the Treasury.Also, under review is EHRI's funding for the Data Warehouse (DW). Historically, the steady state milestone covering DW hosting, operations and maintenance was aligned with EHRI's appropriation. This re-baseline event, however, brings the DW hosting, operations and maintenance milestone in line with the program's EVM baseline.The impact of Agencies not implementing eOPF in FY11 is decreased planned costs in the following milestones:Fee-for-Service - FY2011 Hosting, Operations and MaintenanceFee-for-Service - FY2011 eOPF Implementation -  DoD (partial), Treasury (partial)Fee-for-Service - FY2011 ePower LicensesThe planned cost for the Data Warehouse Production Operations and Maintenance FY2011 milestone is now aligned with EHRI's EVM baseline.

This rebaseline is a correction to the previous 3/1/2011 rebaseline that was to change the funding strategy.                                                     The purpose of this BCR is twofold. First, it brings EHRI's Information Technology (IT) Dashboard milestones in line with its existing Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 earned value management (EVM) baseline. Second, it revises EHRI's FYI2 milestones to be consistent with the Program's Budget Year 2012 appropriated funding passback from the Office of Management & Budget (OMB). These changes do not reflect problems with the investment.                                             The overall impact of this change is to add the initial baseline to the Dashboard and to make reductions to the EHRI spending because EHRI has not received funding from the partner agencies for the associated eOPF implementations, there have been no commitments made by EHRI to any partner agency or contractor. If the partner agencies are unable to secure funding for the eOPF project in the next several months, it will present challenges to both EHRI and partner agencies in meeting stated OPM and OMB performance goals. Additionally, delays in funding may force EHRI scanning vendors to close their facilities and lay off their employees.","","","","","","370.382190","2012-09-30","05/16/2011","12:21:49","6017"

"027-000000020","597","027","Office of Personnel Management","EPIC Transformation","02/26/2011","Rebaseline - change in funding strategy","The EPIC Transformation investment is requesting a rebaseline for FY2011 through the end of the project. This rebaseline provides better definition in the planned budget, schedules and approach and is in alignment with the OMB Memorandum M-10-27 and Federal IT Dashboard.The changes provide a positive impact to ensure the project is proceeding within acceptable thresholds, providing solid planned budget and schedule, while minimizing risk to the production environment.Specifically, we are requesting the following changes:     Increase the Exhibit 300 cost figures for FY12 by 16.5% from the approved baseline projections; increase FY13 - FY16 costs by 3-5% above the proposed FY12 costs. See attached cost spreadsheets for original summary of funding, proposed re-baseline, and cost variance.     Reallocate Development Modernization and Enhancement (DME) costs to Steady State (SS) from FY09 - FY16 to more accurately reflect the nature of USA Staffing operation and maintenance activities.    Add DME costs for Onboarding Manager, which is an expansion of functionality to facilitate the on-boarding process.   Onboarding Manager will be developed and piloted in two phases.  Phase I will be implemented in FY11; Phase II in FY12.    Modify SS and DME milestones for FY11.  Add SS milestones for the period FY11 - FY16 and DME milestones for FY11 - FY12.    Update the FY11 - FY12 performance measures and added performance measures for FY13 - FY16 that are in-line with those that USA Staffing is currently tracking in the four measurement areas: customer results; mission and business results; technology; and processes and activities. These measures would replace the broad Human Resources Solutions (HRS) measures.This rebaseline change was approved by the OPM CIO.

The edits performed by the Dashboard are different for the monthly submissions as compared to Exhibit 300 submission.  The EPIC Transformation investment submitted cost-to-date actuals for FY2011 milestones with no actual completion dates for the milestones still active in September 2011.  The Dashboard recorded these cost-to-date actuals as final total costs.  This rebaseline is removing the final costs on the Dashboard for these activities not yet completed.","230","Projects, Activities","","","2009-2014","","","10/26/2011","15:53:17","6828"

"027-000000053","600","027","Office of Personnel Management","USAJOBS","02/27/2011","Replan - planned change with minimal change in overall scope, cost or schedule objectives","This rebaseline is for the purpose of properly identifying the DME and SS cost and schedule performance data for both the Recruitment One-Stop FY 2010-11 and the USAJOBS 3.0 FY11-12 projects.  Currently, all project costs and milestone schedule performance dates on the current Cost and Schedule Performance Table in eCPIC are categorized as DME.  This is incorrect and needs to be corrected, so that cost and schedule performance data is reflected for both DME and SS activities for these two investments.The overall impact is that the information presented in eCPIC would be correctly categorized for these two projects within the investment.  The cost and schedule performance can be more accurately recorded and tracked between DME and SS related project activities with these changes.Since this re-baseline would simply re-categorize project related costs from all DME to a mixture of DME and SS for both investments, with no net impact to either investment's bottom line project cost, there would be no impact to either investment's ability to meet contractual obligations or on current planned project scope delivery.  Nor would there be any impact to project timelines. ","","","","","","66.815000","2012-09-30","02/27/2011","16:18:07","3552"

During the Exhibit 300 submission the USAJOBS investment had one activity that had a zero instead of a null in the total actual cost field.  This rebaseline is removing the zero and replacing the cost with a null on the Dashboard for one activity not yet completed.  OMB guidance on the subject is:   Note that if left uncorrected, the zero actual costs will mean that an extreme variance for this activity will be calculated, since with actual costs left at zero, the Dashboard records this as an actual cost of zero for the activity in question, and ignores any projected final cost.  If the field is left as a null, however, the Dashboard will take the projected final cost as the operative value to use in any variance calculations.","227","Projects, Activities","","","2003-2016","","","10/27/2011","09:30:50","6833"

This change in acquisition strategy has also resulted in changes in the Project and Acquisition Management Plans, which have been adjusted to reflect the additional time needed to adequately address the milestone changes that have occurred. The Health Claims Data Warehouse (HCDW) is currently in the final planning phase of the acquisition lifecycle, and continues to develop requirements. The scope expansion necessitates the continued re-analysis of risk and requires the program to rebaseline.  HCDW is working to become part of the OIG s FEHBP Data Warehouse and will utilize their existing architecture and technology standards. This change will lower the overall development costs through the use of shared resources and processes and should result in a more reliable product because proven processes will be used. The project team continues to coordinate closely with the CIO's staff to ensure appropriate compliance. This Program is in its infancy and has an inherent level of uncertainty and high level of future development.     The HCDW revised system of records notice (SORN) internal and external review period has been lengthy resulting in a delay to continue the acquisition process, which impacts all future milestones. The HCDW Project remains on hold pending OMB and OPM Director approval of the revised SORN.  OPM first published a system of records notice pertaining to the Health Claims Data Warehouse on October 5, 2010 with the comment period closing November 15, 2010.  On November 15, 2010, OPM extended the comment period to December 15, 2010 and indicated its intent to modify certain aspects of the system of records notice.  On December 15, 2010, OPM published a notice closing the comment period and announced that a revised notice would be published. The revised SORN is currently under review by OMB and HHS. It is anticipated that the revised SORN will be published in the Federal Register sometime March 2011.The revised baseline more accurately represents a realistic and achievable set of milestones.  Additional milestones will be added following completion of the acquisition lifecycle.","","","","","","29364.308400","2016-09-30","02/28/2011","21:18:39","3731"

During the Exhibit 300 submission, the EIO investment had one activity that had a zero instead of a null in the total actual cost field.  This rebaseline is removing the zero and replacing the cost with a null on the Dashboard for one activity not yet completed.  OMB guidance on the subject is:   Note that if left uncorrected, the zero actual costs will mean that an extreme variance for this activity will be calculated, since with actual costs left at zero, the Dashboard records this as an actual cost of zero for the activity in question, and ignores any projected final cost.  If the field is left as a null, however, the Dashboard will take the projected final cost as the operative value to use in any variance calculations.","513","Projects, Activities","","","1998-2023","","","10/27/2011","09:46:23","6834"
