005-000000067,5,Department of Agriculture,47,Risk Management Agency,"The Corporate Insurance Information System (CIIS), investment has been approved for the current fiscal year as a steady state investment.  This investment performs three mission critical functions.  The AFS (Actuarial Filing System) establishes the risk management products sold and serviced via industry partners.  The DAS (Data Acceptance System) acts as the interface between the Agency and its private industry partners transferring data, governs checks and balances between RMA and private technology systems to provide reasonable assurance of quality and reliability of data, and acts as the entry point for all downstream investment/system processing for the Agency.  The investment also includes a MIS (management information system) that includes reporting tools and interfaces for use by the public, partners, interested parties (agricultural groups, agri-business, schools and universities, etc.) and RMA.  Processing under EITA will begin with Reinsurance Year 2011. RMA s legacy systems will process all active Reinsurance Years through 2010.  Although Reinsurance Year 2010 runs from 7/01/2009   6/30/2010, RMA s 2010 Reinsurance Year processing cycle begins with Actuarial Filing (RMA-02) in October 2008.  It includes processing records sent by Approved Insurance Providers (RMA-01 and RMA-02), production of monthly Accounting and Reinsurance Reports (RMA-01 and RMA-02), and processing of Escrow payments for each Approved Insurance Provider (RMA-01).  Processing will not be complete until 3 years after Annual Settlement (2/2014).  At that time shutdown will begin for systems under this investment.  The legacy systems will need to remain on the Sun computers until historical data is incorporated into the new systems on the SQL Server databases being developed under EITA (RMA-13, ITM). Until RMA-13 Emerging Information Technology Architecture (EITA) is fully operational, this investment will continue to perform critical functions unique to the success of the crop insurance program and serve as the heart and soul of program delivery, integrity, and general support to over a million program beneficiaries.  Continued operation of CIIS is required until systems housed in this investment are re-engineered, as this investment is the corporate system of record for RMA.","This investment is the cornerstone of business processing for the delivery of the crop insurance program.  It performs three mission critical functions.  The AFS (Actuarial Filing System) establishes the risk management products sold and serviced via industry partners.  The DAS (Data Acceptance System) acts as the interface between the Agency and its private industry partners transferring data, governs checks and balances between RMA and private technology systems to provide reasonable assurance of quality and reliability of data, acts as the entry point for all downstream investment/system processing for the Agency.  The investment also includes an MIS (management information system) that includes reporting tools and interfaces for use by the public, partners, interested parties (agricultural groups, agri-business, schools and universities, etc.) and RMA.At its initial implementation, CIIS increased efficiency, reduced cost, and provided enhanced functionality and performance in comparison to the older systems it replaced.Over CIIS operational life through the present, there has been increased insurance liability, increased crop and acreage coverage, and enhanced financial stability for farmers, while maintaining approximately flat maintenance costs, thus achieving reduced unit cost and increasing efficiency over its life.  The RMA IRM Review Board (IRMRB) made a decision regarding which of the three alternatives to use for the legacy systems under the CIIS Program.  The basis of the selection was to address a number of factors including the relative age of this investment and the systems associated with it and the need to address new business requirements and more stringent IT audit and accounting standards.  Alternative 3 uses the CIIS Project approach and consists of the following:*Alternative 3:  Implement the ITM project. Develop a comprehensive approach that addresses all issues raised in the ILS documents: current Business Practices Assessment Report (November 15, 2001), Best Practices and Supporting Emerging Information Technologies Report (November 15, 2001), 5-Year Information Technology and Change Management Plan (April 3, 2002). Develop comprehensive enterprise architecture and fully OCIO (policy) compliant systems under this investment.  Address all CPIC, Cyber Security, and Audit deficiencies within this large-scale reengineering project (24-36 months).  This approach closely follows the proposals in the ILS studies.","DAS - During FY2011 the DAS application implemented the Common Land Unit Record and brought up a new reinsurance year. Processing under the Data Acceptance System (DAS) was replaced by the Policy Acceptance and Storage System (PASS) in FY2011, which was developed under the EITA investment (RMA-13).

STARS supports FNS efforts to monitor stores authorized to participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and facilitates removal of authorization when stores are found to be in violation of program regulations.  In doing this, the STARS investment supports the FNS strategic goal of Improved Stewardship of Federal Funds in its programs, which in turn, supports the USDA strategic goal #4, Ensure that All of America s Children Have Access to Safe, Nutritious, and Balanced Meals. There are no dependencies between STARS and any other investment.","STARS supports the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program (SNAP) mission by tracking and monitoring three critical areas: 1) store authorizations and re-authorizations; 2) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program (SNAP) food coupon/electronic benefit redemption activities, including accounting support for the SNAP redemption account; and 3) regulatory violations by stores and associated administrative actions (including maintenance of case histories) related to enforcement of related penalties.  In doing this, the STARS investment supports the USDA strategic goal #4, Ensure that All of America s Children Have Access to Safe, Nutritious, and Balanced Meals.  STARS is a mission-critical system for USDA FNS and if it is not fully funded, then it would affect the performance of the SNAP program.","1.Included an automated, risk-based workflow for SNAP retailer applications.

005-000000028,5,Department of Agriculture,96,Forest Service,"ROSS is the interagency Resource Ordering and Status System.  ROSS is a core business application which supports the nation's emergency response framework.  ROSS is recognized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as the standard for a national mobilization system.  ROSS has been implemented in more than 350 interagency dispatch offices nationwide that support member agencies of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG).  Currently, there are more than 600 agencies that benefit from using ROSS.  These agencies are comprised of the NWCG member agencies and those agencies who cooperate through agreement in meeting the mission of the NWCG agencies.  ROSS reflects an interagency leadership vision by transforming the way that resource ordering and status activities are performed, replacing manual processes with more efficient and streamlined automated processes. Interagency representatives are extensively involved in the ROSS project.   ROSS has dependencies on and interfaces with two systems: the Forest Service s Interagency Cache Business System (ICBS) and the Department of Interior s Interagency Qualifications and Certifications System (IQCS).  These systems exchange data with ROSS to assure a consistent data set across systems.  ROSS depends on ICBS for Supply Inventory and Supply Catalog Information.  ROSS depends on IQCS for Resource Overhead and Resource Overhead Catalog Information.","Prior to the development of the ROSS application, resource ordering and status activities were all performed manually.  In 1997, the original charter for ROSS was adopted.  Between 1997 and 2005, ROSS was developed and successfully implemented by the user community.  The ROSS application is recognized for transforming the business of resource ordering and statusing.Through the ROSS change management process, performance gaps were identified with the original chartered scope of ROSS.  The ROSS Phase 2 project was chartered to address these gaps.  For example, the ROSS application did not have the ability to manage tactical aviation resources efficiently.  Another example of a gap includes system interfaces, such as creating generic data exchange capabilities so that related systems (e.g., IQCS) can share information with ROSS.  ROSS Phase 2 was chartered to address these and other gaps.  If ROSS does not acquire full funding, ROSS will not achieve the chartered scope of ROSS Phase 2.  More importantly, if ROSS does not acquire full funding, the ability to support operations and maintenance is in jeopardy. Absent funding, the ROSS project risks failing to meet current and evolving business needs, making it difficult for dispatchers to do things efficiently because they may be forced to do things outside of ROSS. The ROSS Project Team has been criticized over and over again for not putting in place (in a timely manner) the components approved in the ROSS Phase 2 Charter. National and Geographic Reports and Reviews have pointed out that ROSS is not funded at the level necessary to implement the requirements of ROSS Phase 2 in the time frames required. Of note was extensive White House and Congressional attention resulting from issues occurring during the Southern California Fire Sieges (November 2007, June 2008, October 2008). Large reductions in the ROSS DME (Phase 2) budget from request is a major contributor to this issue. The ROSS Phase 2 has been reduced by nearly $2 million from the requested level since FY-2008.","During 2011, ROSS release 2.14 occurred.  The primary objective of version 2.14 was to complete the ROSS Reports Module through the addition of Analytical Reports (Historical), which provides access to multiple year datasets (from 2009 forward) and permits analysis of summary, trend and point in time information. Other objectives accomplished during 2011 included providing additional capability when searching, filtering, or viewing tracked supply requests and enhancing the Interagency Cache Business System (ICBS), Incident Qualification System (IQS) and Incident Qualifications and Certification System (IQCS) interfaces.","During FY-2012 ROSS will release versions 2.14.1 and 2.15.  The focus of these versions will be to refine the business processes associated with the ROSS / ICBS Data Exchange Interface.  In addition, ROSS 2.14.1 will introduce a updated security model. In addition, these two releases will address business rule changes requested by the user community, patches to the software, and defects identified through the ROSS change control process.  In FY-2013 ROSS Version 3.0 will be released.  ROSS 3.0 introduced a completely re-engineered system (Technically Refreshed) which utilizes the most current web technology available.  This includes upgraded versions of all base software (e.g., Oracle) as well as ensuring that ROSS can run on new Operating Systems.  In addition, ROSS 3.0 will enhance the security model from releases 2.14.1and 2.15 even further to meet evolving OMB and departmental security requirements and position the ROSS application to respond more rapidly to new and emerging security threats.  ROSS 3.0 also re-engineers the ROSS application for efficiency and speed (e.g., there is a new screen design that will combine existing screens   reducing five and six screens to one screen   so that users can do things more rapidly).",38.8913,10.58082,10.3945,9.03997,2008.0,2015.0,The summary of spending has changed from the prior year's (FY2010) budget request for ROSS.  This is due to the decision to move the costs associated with the hot site to a separate Fire NESS investment and the decision to move all costs associated with the Help Desk to a separate investment.  Both of these have resulted in a decrease in the overall cost of ROSS.,"ROSS has been a major investment since inception. In 2006, ROSS moved to O&amp;M and the collection of EVM was stopped.  ROSS Phase 2 (ROSS-2) was created in 2003 in response to new requirements for ROSS functionality.  At that time, Forest Service leadership deemed ROSS-2 as a non-major investment and that EVM was not required. The government is considered to be the integrator for ROSS.  As a result, the government receives monthly cost and schedule updates from all the contractors and integrates that information with the government's overall project management approach, and reports this information through the USDA EVM reporting system, SharePoint.  The decision in 2007 to merge ROSS and ROSS-2 into a single investment resulted in Forest Service Leadership requiring EVM reporting for the combined ROSS Project.  With this decision, Lockheed Martin, the development contractor, began to report earned value metrics (e.g., % complete) in 2008.  The remaining contracts are described below:  **CPIC/Security - This contract provides support to several Fire Applications, including ROSS.  It is fixed price; EVM is not required because it supports ROSS O&amp;M.*Tech Writer/SME - This contract focuses on providing subject matter expertise for ROSS and other Fire applications.

005-000000093,5,Department of Agriculture,96,Forest Service,"The Automated Timber Sale Accounting System (ATSA) is a mainframe system hosted at NITC in Kansas City, MO.   ATSA was implemented approximately 30 years ago in response to the deluge of congressional acts, and laws that regulate the management of forest products, such as the Clarke-McNary Act and the National Forest Management Act.  Therefore, ATSA was the response to these legislations coupled with contract laws by automating the ability to calculate in an efficient and timely manner the amount due from the public based on the sale of forest products. ATSA aligns with the priorities and Strategic Goals of the Secretary, OCFO, CFO and Deputy Chiefs by providing and maintaining reliable financial management information and infrastructure, as well as excellence in the delivery of timely financial information for sound decision making.Selling timber and properly accounting for the financial impact of that activity is a major portion of the Forest Service mission. The sale of forest products is the largest revenue generating business process in the agency. The application continues to consistently perform effectively for the agency.   In fiscal year 2009, the system processed approximately 36,000 transactions totaling over $450m.","ATSA integrates or interfaces with TIM, All Service Receipts System (ASR), and FFIS.  An integration with TIM bridges the resource information, such as the amount of timber harvested and other contractual information, with TSA which is the financial engine to perform various calculations based on applicable laws to determine the amount due from the public as well as the revenue earned by the agency.  Because of the revenues generated as a result of this system, it is extensively audited by KPMG and has never had any significant or material weaknesses.  This information interfaces with FFIS to establish the billing and balanced voucher documents related to timber sales.  The system also receives collection and other financial information through a backfeed from FFIS to ensure that the accounting impacts are updated in ATSA. This demonstrates that it operates without problems and properly integrates/interfaces with TIM and FFIS which then serves as input for the financial statements and reports.  ATSA substantially complies with several federal policies and standards, such as OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, which prescribes policies and standards for executive departments and agencies to follow when managing their financial management systems.  ATSA does not have any direct users since the data entry was subsumed in NRM TIM in December 2007.  However, ATSA creates over 75 various reports that are used by forest products regional coordinators, timber sale administrators, and ASC.  The reports are used by the field to manage their overall timber sale program, specifically, oversee the timber purchasers' account; assess the financial condition of the contracts, active sales. The earned revenue data generated in ATSA is interfaced to ASR monthly.  This data is certified by the timber regional coordinators and is used to calculate the payment to states and grassland counties which averages about $500m annually.  The WO NFS staff uses the data as an example to respond to congressional inquiries.","Addressed issues in production runs, handled all error codes.Created indicator for Stimulus fundind, corrected issue that causes imbalances in FFIS and TSA.Applied NLC's to all contracts using the WWPA or PNWC indices due to the Western Wood Products Association's Five-Year Grade Recovery Study.

EPermits provides customers with the ability to apply for an import permit, check its status, view it online, and pay for it with a credit card using Treasury s Pay.gov site. It supports the permit review and issuance process for three programs in APHIS   Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Veterinary Services (VS), and the Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS). The Fruits and Vegetables Import Requirements (FAVIR) database was added to the ePermits system as a component in 2007. The purpose of the database is to provide the public with an online tool to obtain information related to the import requirements for fruits and vegetables coming into the U.S., and to incorporate the import requirements and conditions directly into the permit applications and forms for these commodities. ePermits provides significant benefits by facilitating process improvements centered on the handling of permits within APHIS.  ePermits enables APHIS to assist the customer in processing permits more efficiently through the implementation of a common web interface. Documents are available to permitting specialists who require them for completion of processing, ultimately making internal processes more efficient.  FY2010 ePermits benefits include: Provided Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS) the ability to view and comment on VS permits of joint jurisdiction; Provided the ports of entry and Plant Inspection Stations with information to verify the authenticity of permits and products coming into the country; Enhanced search capabilities on the Fruits and Vegetables Import Requirements (FAVIR) website to recognize plurals, special characters, and foreign characters; and Enhanced the ability to search all BRS Permits within a specified geographical area using a Location Unique Id and GPS Coordinates.","ePermits supports multiple USDA Strategic Goals. ePermits directly supports Strategic Goal 2: Ensure our national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources, Strategic Goal 3: Help America promote agricultural production and biotechnology exports as America works to increase food security, Strategic Goal 4: Ensure that all of America s children have access to safe, nutritious, and balanced meals, by providing an automated centralized solution for permitting. ePermits also supports Management Initiative V: Optimize Information Technology (IT) Policy and Applications, by supporting Biotechnology Services, Plant Protection and Quarantine, and Veterinary Services electron permitting process and reducing the workforce need to process permits, standardizing the permitting process and increasing the efficiency of issuing domestic and international permits. ePemits allows APHIS permitting divisions in 3 programs to fully comply with Management Initiative VI: Optimize USDA  Green  or Sustainable Operations, by automation the permitting application process. ePermits also assist with the compliance of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) Strategic Goal 2: Protect forests and private lands, as well as natural resources; Goal 3: Expand opportunities to develop and trade safe agricultural products, including biotechnology derived agricultural products; Goal 4: Minimize and prevent damage to the U.S. food supply caused by plant and animal pests and diseases; Goal 6: Accomplish our mission through effective and efficient management of our programs.",PY Accomplishments (FY 2011).Biotechnology Regulatory Services Planting Reports Module.

005-000002317,5,Department of Agriculture,55,Rural Development,"The Comprehensive Loan Program (CLP) initiative was launched by USDA Rural Development (RD) to modernize and streamline the application delivery portfolio in order to better serve RD s citizen beneficiaries, and to provide RD employees with the technology and tools they need to pursue RD s mission.  RD offers a variety of direct and guaranteed loan programs for Single Family (SF) and Multi-Family (MF) Housing, Business, Community Facilities, and Utilities programs.  The current IT portfolio that supports the various loan programs consists of over 100 systems built on a variety of hosting platforms, system technologies, and database software some of which are program specific and duplicate functionality.  As a result, the current IT platform prevents the introduction of new programs and lacks a user-friendly environment and a robust enterprise management reporting capability.  CLP is designed to deliver a more agile, more flexible, and more fully integrated IT platform.  It will:  Improve the delivery and access of RD services to citizens; Provide RD staff in the field offices and other locations with greatly improved automation support; Enable more rapid rollout of new or changed programs; Provide improved data accessibility and reporting to support executive decision making; Reduce operations and maintenance complexity through the elimination of duplicate IT systems; and  Modernize the technologies to help ensure improve availability of support, systems security, and longevity of systems.The goal of CLP is to subsume all existing systems to form one integrated investments.  In FY2009 and FY2010, the CLP investment included only development, modernization and enhancement (DME) activities associated with modernizing the current application portfolio.  In FY2011, the Housing investment was subsumed into the CLP investment.  By FY2012, the CLP investment will subsume the remaining RD operational investments: Guaranteed, Commercial, Program Funds Control System, Business Intelligence, Automated Mail Processing, RD eGovernment, RD Performance Management, and Program Loan Accounting System.  The CLP investment will integrate the general ledger, cash tracking and funds control functionality from existing RD legacy systems to the USDA FMMI initiative when the USDA is ready to intitiate the effort.","Developed over a long period of time, RD s IT portfolio consists of a large number of disparate  systems built on a variety of hosting platforms, systems technologies, and database software.  Because these systems and processes are program-specific, they duplicate functions rather than integrate them and often contain redundant and conflicting data.  As a result, RD spends a large portion of its annual budget to maintain the current portfolio of loan processing, accounting, project tracking and supporting systems. The lack of standardization makes using the systems challenging for RD staff and external users and inhibits accurate reporting.  CLP will modernize and streamline the systems RD uses to manage the housing, business and utilities loan and grant programs.  Systems changes are underway that will enable loans and grants to reach recipients faster and will create a more receptive environment for lenders and other strategic partners.  Customers, lenders, partners, and RD personnel will have a single point of access to utilize the technologies supporting the loans and grants process.  Collected data will be shared across programs to eliminate redundant and conflicting data.  Customer portals will be created that will bolster regional collaboration by allowing private and federal lenders to interface with RD s loan and grant systems, enable RD personnel to perform their work anywhere (e.g., mobile computing), and allow leadership to more effectively and efficiently manage RD s programs by providing them access to data through robust reporting, dashboards and maps.  The user-friendly IT systems, platforms, and forums will enhance the customer and stakeholder experience and enable RD to implement program changes more quickly and efficiently. Rural Development acknowledges that the approved life cycle cost of $650,473,810 for CLP does not currently match the $644,466,783 cost currently reflected in the Summary of Spending Table.  RD, as of February 2012, made the appropriate adjustments to the CLP DLCC's to match the approved cost.  The Summary of Spending and RD's Exhibit 53 will not be corrected until the next submission opportunity since the correction was made after 2013 passbacks.

FMMI will replace the Corporate Financial Management System (CFMS) investment, of which the financial system is the mainframe-based Foundation Financial Information System (FFIS).Through technology consolidation and modernization, FMMI will eliminate the need to operate and maintain certain USDA legacy feeder systems and the data warehouse that FFIS currently requires to produce timely external financial statements as well as the sole burden on USDA to maintain Federal Systems Integration Office (FSIO) compliance, which is no longer supported by the FFIS vendor. In addition to the process efficiencies resulting from technology consolidation and the cost savings associated with shifting the burden to the vendor for compliance maintenance, FMMI will also close performance gaps existing in the status quo, the CFMS investment, by providing on-demand search and reporting capabilities, functionality unavailable in the current mainframe environment but critical to the 14,000 USDA system users (which include agency CFOs and procurement and financial management personnel, etc.), and by providing a system that aligns with business processes, resulting in improved user efficiency. The OCFO began its goal of designing, building, testing, and implementing the FMMI system in FY 2010, eliminating 6 agencies and 13 staff offices at the USDA. FMMI will enable USDA OCFO to continue to provide sound and efficient financial management in support of the USDA mission to enhance the quality of life for the American people.","FMMI addresses the need for improved financial performance through a modern financial system that provides maximum support to mission.

These scenarios will be evaluated at the Fire Planning Unit (FPU) and national level to develop effective program options. A functional prototype was completed in 2008; full implementation is currently on-going.The FPA Phase 2 (FPA-2) project focuses on developing and implementing an analysis tool to support strategic planning and budgeting for a comprehensive, interagency fire management program at the national level. FPA provides land managers with the ability to analyze and determine the cost-optimized wildland fire management program and its effects on multiple program objectives at any budget level. FPA2 is currently in O&amp;M. FPA-2 is managed according to established OMB and Project Management Institute (PMI) standards and practices, including American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/EIA-748 Earned Value Management (EVM). In accordance with USDA requirements, EVM reporting requirements have been eliminated now that FPA-2 is a SS investment.The investment project, Fire Program Analysis - Phase 2 (FPA-2), is an interagency project of the five federal wildland fire management agencies: * US Forest Service (USFS) * Department of Interior (DOI) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) * DOI National Park Service (NPS) * DOI U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (USFWS) *DOI Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). These fire management agencies are also the primary beneficiaries of this investment. FPA-2 has involved the National Association of State Foresters as well as state and local fire organizations. The FPA-2 project will close important performance gaps for the interagency wildland fire management agencies, including gaps identified in: Federal Wildland Fire Policy, National Fire Plan, The congressional report titled  &quot;Developing an Interagency, Landscape Scale Fire Planning Analysis and Budget Tool&quot;, November 2001 (Hubbard Report), as well as discussions with and direction from OMB and the Congressional Appropriations Committee. FPA is chartered by the US Forest Service and DOI.This investment has transactional relationships with other wildland fire investments.","From a mission delivery and management support perspective USFS &amp; DOI is responsible to provide a common interagency process for strategic fire management planning and budgeting as per congressional directive. They also have the responsibility to provide capability across participating functional areas for capturing and reporting impacts to the fire management programs given alternate budget scenarios and to identify the appropriate funding levels to support an effective fire management program. The capabilities of the FPA investment and output products addresses the gaps identified above and provide the optimum solution to mitigate those gaps. It will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative fire resource management strategies to support land management goals and objectives. In FPA, effectiveness is assessed in terms of multiple performance measures that are consistent with these land management goals and objectives. The performance measures broadly address reducing the probability of occurrence of costly fires, reducing the probability of occurrence of fire in the Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI), and increasing lands meeting or trending towards the attainment of land management objectives including protecting highly valued resources.  If funding is reduced for this investment by ten percent or more, FPA will not be able to provide the mission delivery responsibility as directed by congress. If funding is eliminated for the FPA investment, the benificiaries will be left without a system for performing trade off analysis to determine an effective mix of fire resources for different budget levels in multiple fiscal years. This will create significant cost disadvantages for participating departments; bureaus; and programs. The disadvantages are not having the ability to evaluate different combinations of resources at various budget scenarios; to report, share, or analyze data as required to recommend an effective budget request; or evaluate the effectiveness of budget allocations. Three primary areas impacted by cancelling this program are:1. Hazardous fuels :  Determining the impact of hazardous fuels treatments on preparedness2.

The FLP acts as a lender of first opportunity to new and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers who are unable to obtain credit through commercial lenders, enabling them to establish or stabilize their operations in the face of financial hardship and/or natural disasters.  The FLP is administered through a network of 850 USDA Service Centers, 50 State offices, the Loan Accounting Office, the Farm Loan Operations Office, and a National Program Office.  The legacy FLP systems and business environment are highly decentralized.  This status quo environment presents a combination of strategic, operational, and technical risks that, taken together, severely undermine FSAs ability to continue to support the mission of reliably and equitably providing capital to qualified farmers and ranchers.The Consolidated Farm Loan Program Information Delivery System (CFLPIDS) investment is designed to streamline and modernize Farm Loan Program s (FLP) inefficient, duplicative, and paper-based loan making and loan servicing processes and systems.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, want the ability for FSA staff members and their partners to have the tools, capabilities and infrastructure to provide both mobile and in-office loan assistance and servicing.  The agency, the producers and external partners will all have the ability to share data.  The CFLPIDS system will eliminate the duplication of  data entries, data will be more accessible, ad hoc reports will be easily generated and presentation of the on-line screens will be similar to that of popular commercial products providing a consistent look that is user friendly.While not dependent on any other investments, CFLPIDS is always looking for ways to leverage technology and partner with other USDA Agencies in ordered to utilize shared systems.  CFLPIDS currently uses the Service Center Information Management System (SCIMS) to register Borrowers and keep track of personal information and the Program Funds Control System (PFCS) for Allotment funds control.  CFLPIDS is also currently in the process of analyzing the best fit and interface points for the Departmental Systems; Financial Management Modernization Initiative (FMMI) and Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems (MIDAS).","The CFLPIDS investment is designed to implement modern information technology systems and policies in a cost effective manner that improve program delivery and internal and external communications capabilities to better serve FLP customers by achieving the following key benefits: - Enable an integrated timely view of the programs risk profile by creating centralization.- Streamlined modernized business processes that eliminate redundant data entry. - Faster delivery and obligation of loans to eligible farmers and ranchers.  - Automation of routine tasks that currently require substantial manual effort.  - More accurate, reliable and available data for reporting, research and inquiry.","FY 2011 specific goals focused on improved FLP Loan Servicing processes while ensuring fair and equitable treatment of all customers:- Implementation of Debt Restructure processing to further assist in Specialized Servicing functions.- Assume more functionality from the Legacy Program Loan Accounting System (PLAS) by implementing several Specialized Servicing Transactions (1M, 3H, 3O, 3Q, 3R, 3V, 5G, 5S, 5T, 5W, and 5Y).  - Create an On-Line History process to aid Field and National Office personnel to more efficiently process Borrower accounts.- Improved administrative function and cross referencing WEB processes.- Provide loan information in a web-based solution which integrates data from multiple systems supporting FLP thereby reducing the number of delinquent and/or distressed loans.- Provide a web-based capability to automatically reverse and reapply cash payments when servicing FLP customer accounts.","FY 2012 specific goals focus on improvement in FLP Special Servicing processes and monitoring of repayment activity: - Assume more functionality from the Legacy Program Loan Accounting System (PLAS) by implementing several Finance Office Transactions (1A, 1C,1D,1F,1E, 1J, 1Y, and 8H).  - Assume more functionality from the Legacy Program Loan Accounting System (PLAS) by implementing several Statistical Transactions (1T, 5M, 4F, 5N, and 4L).  - Develop Loan Statistical Web Pages.- Design and Implement the 8R Transaction.FY 2013 specific goals focus on continued improvement in FLP loan servicing processes:- Design and Implement Debt Settlement Transactions (3K, 3B, and 3T).- Design and Implement Statistical Transactions (5A, 5B, 5J, and 5C).- Design and implement DRT Reversals (1M, 3O, 3Q, 3R, 3V, 5W, 5T, and 5X).- Develop Statistical Status Web pages.",88.655526,14.072488,14.317668,13.838,2002.0,2018.0,"Budgetary funding reductions have reduced scope in recent years thereby extending the project schedule beyond 2015.

This investment supports RMA's strategic plan using e-commerce technology to integrate RMA and its insurance delivery partners into a single electronic community.  It provides ongoing &amp; reliable business intelligence for managing &amp; improving all aspects of the program. Investment goal is IT strategically aligned to support core business processes, its mission, strategic goals, &amp; objectives.  The design leverages common enterprise services to provide information consistency &amp; integrity as well as cost savings.  RMA-13 is dependent upon RMA-04 for all infrastructure &amp; hosting, however costs are apportioned to RMA-13 and other investments.  RMA-13 is also dependent on data processed and stored in legacy systems (RMA-01 &amp; RMA-02) until such time as legacy systems are re-engineered for ALL active reinsurance years.","In keeping with its strategic goals, RMA has implemented an average of over ten new risk management products each year.  The business logic to support these new products must be integrated into the IT business systems.  Sometimes only minor modifications are required, while often the business changes drive major system and database re-design.  One of the goals of this investment is to create IT systems which are designed in a flexible, dynamic manner so that they can more easily incorporate new product lines and adapt to changing business rules.  Lack of full funding could prevent RMA from meeting its contractual obligations as stated in the Standard Reinsurance Agreement between RMA and each of its Approved Insurance Providers.

005-000000039,5,Department of Agriculture,5,Departmental Management,"IAS is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), web-based solution to the USDA's procurement needs. IAS has approximately 6,000 active users comprised of Requisitioners, Budget Approvers, Contracting Officers, Receivers, and Payment Specialists across 10 agencies nationwide. This enterprise wide system, with a real time interface to the financial systems of record Foundation Financial Information System (FFIS) and Financial Management Modernization Initiative (FMMI), serves the vast USDA procurement community by providing significant efficiencies. IAS interfaces to three systems - FFIS, FMMI, and the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG).  With FFIS, IAS checks for funds availability, commits and obligates funds real-time and allows users to authorize vendor payment. FFIS is the predecessor to FMMI and is still used by Agencies that have not yet implemented the new financial system. USDA plans to eventually deploy FMMI in all Agencies; however until this is accomplished, IAS will continue to interface with both systems as needed.  While the accounting functionality of FFIS and FMMI are similar, FMMI is a more modernized tool with robust reporting and viewing capabilities in a user-friendly interface with web functionality.  IAS also interfaces with FPDS-NG, which is a congressional database established to collect historical and statistical information about the government s procurements.  With this external system, IAS feeds award information directly to satisfy mandated reporting requirements.IAS aligns with four of the USDA Management Initiatives from the USDA Strategic Plan for FY2010 - 2015.  These are: Initiative I: Engage USDA Employees to Transform USDA into a Model Agency (accomplishes this by measuring and increasing the satisfaction of its users); Initiative IV - Leverage USDA Departmental Management to Increase Performance, Efficiency, and Alignment (accomplishes this by ensuring reliable and accurate Department-wide procurement-related financial information); Initiative V - Optimize Information Technology (IT) Policy and Applications (accomplishes this by implementing a modern, secure, and robust delivery platform across its enterprise); Initiative VII - Enhance USDA Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness to Protect USDA Employees and the Public (accomplishes this by improving information technology security and enhancing continuity plans).","IAS is the primary procurement application for all USDA. Without the investment being fully funded, USDA will lose visibility into Agency-wide procurement.The Assistant Secretary for Administration (ASA) established a strategic goal to provide effective policy, services, and coordination, as well as several objectives, including the provision of value-added products, services and solutions to USDA. IAS, an enterprise system provides a value-added solution to the procurement community, and by providing a robust, accessible, transparent and comprehensive solution, IAS is aligned with the ASA's strategic goals. The ASA also has a goal to ensure all USDA program activities are accessible and accountable with an objective to provide oversight and ensure timely and accurate reporting.  The ASA has established a goal to provide effective policy, services, and coordination.  To accomplish that goal, several supporting activities have been identified, including the need to measure customer satisfaction and continuously improve delivery.  The IAS goal to ensure superior customer service is aligned to the ASA's goal to provide effective services and to meet and exceed the needs of customers by constantly evaluating feedback and making changes to ensure superior customer service. Another measure taken to meet customer needs is the improved IAS website that was rolled out in FY2010.  The website is regularly updated to provide users with the most current and useful information on the IAS. IAS classroom training sessions targeted to specific user roles were offered in FY2011 and FY2012 to enhance the customer experience and assist with the onboarding process.","IAS's main accomplishment in PY was the successful implementation of the Oracle 12.1 Upgrade from Oracle Release 11.5.10. Oracle 12.1 was a necessary upgrade because Oracle 11.5.10 that was in use ceased to be supported by Oracle in November 2011.  This upgrade improved security by resolving known defects and brought IAS up to date on security patches. Futhermore, the upgrade served as a conduit to build new user functionality to enhance the user experience. In addition to the user interface, the IAS Oracle Database software was upgraded from Oracle 10.2 (10g) to Oracle 11.2.2 (11g) increasing performance and online database administration capabilities.","The two major accomplishments that IAS has planned for CY and BY are implementation of eAuthentication and FMMI Business Intelligence (BI) PDM Oracle Discoverer. eAuthentication will allow IAS to adopt and implement Single Sign-On (SSO).  This enhancement will allow users the flexibility of a SSO that will eliminate the need for multiple user-names and passwords as well as enforcing strong password and authentication policies.  Oracle Discoverer is a reporting utility for which IAS already has licenses and will allow the IAS program to implement FMMI Business Intelligence (BI) PDM Oracle Discoverer.

PHICP provides a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach for single source mission critical data reporting, establishes a common service for authentication/authorization, uses predictive models to analyze real time data from FSIS and other Federal, state, and local agencies, and provides a consolidated web-based user interface.","PHICP CLOSES AGENCY PERFORMANCE GAP - The applications/systems included in the PHICP investment help close agency performance gaps by providing more effective and cost efficient services to better detect and prevent food safety threats.  For example, the projects within PHICP will provide an analytical tool and data to improve the agency's ability to detect the introduction of intentional/unintentional food borne threats; enable near real-time data collection for reporting and analysis; provide the ability to collect information to assist FSIS with trace back and trace forward investigations for identifying product disposition and/or the origins of hazards; provide the ability to collaborate with DHS, FDA, international trading partners and with other USDA agencies to improve mission critical performance in inspections, surveillance, tracking, auditing, enforcement, etc.; provide the ability to assess vulnerabilities and enhance the food safety inspection programs; provide a leading-edge framework to streamline future development and integration and leverage the current upgrade of broadband connectivity to more rapidly collect data to spot trends.  The funding for the DM&amp;E and O&amp;M for many of these projects are included as actual costs within this investment.  As a result of a TechStat review, the future costs for all projects other than PHIS, all of which are non-major investments, were moved out of this investment to allow better focus on PHIS, which is a major investment. PHIS Automates and replaces many of FSIS  existing systems, such as PBIS, RIS and AIIS. PHIS integrates these separate and disparate systems into one comprehensive data-driven, easy-to-use data-analytics system.  PHIS will facilitate sharing of data among inspection personnel, their managers and headquarters on a daily basis. PHIS is a powerful decision making tool that will enable FSIS to protect public health more efficiently, effectively and rapidly than under existing systems.  PHIS will operate through the interaction of four components: domestic inspection, import activities, export activities and predictive analytics. PHIS provides data services not currently available, to meet OIG recommendations, including integrate data streams and provide data reporting and visualization tools; perform real-time data mining and send alerts when irregularities are detected; automated scheduling rules will provide quicker response time when reacting to events and performing task.","The PHIS system completed User Acceptance Testing and began user training and rollout to the Domestic circuits.  Significant data migration and loading changes were implemented; reducing user and data quality errors, as well as improvements to system performance implemented following User Acceptance Testing.

005-000002328,5,Department of Agriculture,96,Forest Service,"IBS is an Internet Application that was developed in response to 1) promulgated acts and policies, such as &quot;The 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy&quot; which is the single cohesive federal fire policy for the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, 2) OIG's audit of EERA's in 2004 which cited the agency's inability to identify agency-wide acquisition needs, as well as establish rates for best value, and 3) improve the efficiency and timeliness of recording and paying all incident related financial activities, i.e. single point of data entry, timely casual payment, and reliable, accurate, and repeatable status of funds to OMB.  It consists of the Aviation Business System (ABS), the Incident Business Database (IBDB), and the Aviation Disconnected Client application. Collectively, these applications streamline the collection of financial data from the field, and automate the Incident Business accruals and payment process at the Albuquerque Service Center (ASC). There are currently 2000 users, of which 100 are concurrent users.  Peak demand is March through November.  Historically, on annual bases, IBS interfaced to FFIS over $700m of payment and accrual transactions; thus, the reason for a dedicated Incident Finance staff at the ASC.Many systems integrate or interface with IBS to share valuable single entry point of data that is used to record the financial impact of incident business. I-Suite which is a system owned by Fire and Aviation Management provides the fire time reports for Administratively Determined staff (referred to as casual pay), such as incident crews. The fire time reports are verified and automatically submitted by IBS to DOI/NBC's Federal Personnel Payroll System (FPPS).  EAV which is a system owned by Acquisition Management provides the contract information for non-FS aviation equipment which is validated against the ABS invoices for services provided.  Integration of these systems to IBS support various activities that lead to the final stage or life-cycle of the transactions, such as recording obligations and expenditures and establishing payables that lead to a payment disbursed by Treasury.","IBS is innovative in that it utilizes disconnected client for ABS which makes it convenient and effective to use the service by providing offline capabilities. IBS' implemented a service-oriented architecture by use of an enterprise service bus (ESB). The ESB is what manages the single interaction and integration consistently for various systems and services as well as produce the output whether internal or external to many other or same systems. IBS automates the establishment of invoices for services provided by aviation vendors which are sent to FFIS for payments.  It also creates the accruals as well as the payment for equipment rental agreements.  The ability to accurately forecast financial obligations for incidents is critical. These transactions are possible because of the streamlined collection of financial data from the field.  The incident management business process requires a collaborative approach across three primary deputy area (CFO, BusOps and S&amp;PF) as well as external partners, including DOI, Bureau of Land Management.  The stand up of an Incident Support System Environment Steering Committee will ensure a coordinated approach to the governance of incident business management support systems and related activities.

005-000001659,5,Department of Agriculture,32,Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,"The Animal Disease Traceability Information System (ADTIS) [formerly called NAIS] is the Information Technology (IT) system that supports the USDA Animal Disease Traceability Program.  The USDA Animal Disease Traceability Program provides a flexible framework for animal disease traceability in the United States.  This framework provides the basic tenets of an animal disease traceability capability in the United States.  USDA s efforts:-Only apply to animals moved in interstate commerce; -Are administered by the States and Tribal Nations to provide more flexibility; -Encourage the use of lower-cost technology; and -Are implemented transparently through federal regulations and the full rulemaking process. The Animal Disease Traceability Information System (ADTIS) is a co-operative State-Federal-industry partnership system designed for the purpose of standardizing and expanding animal identification (ID) programs and practices to all animals that would benefit from rapid trace backs in the event of a disease of bioterrorism concern.  The goal of the ADTIS is to enable traceback of the movement of any diseased or exposed animal.  This will help to ensure rapid disease containment and maximum protection of America s food and recreational animals.The ADTIS system contains five modules and one repository; The Premises ID Number Allocator (Allocator), Standard Premises Information System (SPIS), Data Management Center (DMC), Animal ID Management System (AIMS) and the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS), National Premises Information Repository (NPIR).  These modules have been deployed to support premises registration, animal identification management and animal tracing in the US. ADTIS integrates with the following systems:Private Systems: Compliant Premises Information Systems (CPIS); Device Manufacturers; Animal Tracking Databases (ATD).APHIS Systems: APHIS Cost Management Systems (ACMS); Animal Health and Surveillance Management (AHSM); Veterinary Services Process Streamlining (VSPS); Emergency Management Response System (EMRS).Stakeholders are: U.S. Animal Health Association; American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians; State and Federal animal health officials; Accredited Veterinarians; Producers and livestock markets; National/International consumers.","The ability to control and eventually eradicate an erupting animal disease varies directly with (1) the time it takes to initially trace the movements of suspect animals and (2) the accuracy of the historical data.  The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) relies on a multitude of State and local systems to trace the origin of an infected animal.  Depending on the maturity and reliability of the local system, time lags exacerbate the impact of the outbreak.  The immediate effect of these delays is a negative economic impact on industry and damage to the credibility of the USDA overall. Fundamental to controlling any disease threat to the nation s livestock is a system that can uniquely identify individual animals or groups of animals, all the premises where they are or have been located, and the date of entry to the premises. The system must be able to retrieve that information within 48 hours of confirmation of a disease outbreak in order to succeed in controlling or eradicating an animal health threat, and to enable the implementation of intervention strategies. The USDA system that provides these capabilities is the ADTIS. ADTIS administers official premises and animal identification and provides epidemiological traceback information in the event of an animal disease outbreak. The Animal Disease Traceability Information System (ADTIS) is a system that can uniquely identify individual animals or groups of animals, the premises where they are located, and the date of entry to that premises.

IT capital investment includes the HPC systems, complementary storage devices and interconnects, communications hardware interfaces, software, networking equipment, system maintenance, support services, IT security, and necessary infrastructure enhancements. This Exhibit represents a coordinated and centralized capital planning effort for three NOAA HPC organizations, and is intended to improve the acquisition process and to achieve economies of scale through consolidation of system requirements and a reduced number of individual acquisitions.NOAA's R&amp;D HPCS resources enable scientists to attack long-lead-time problems associated with the physical processes that govern the behavior of the atmosphere and the ocean. Advanced climate models are the only means for distinguishing between natural and forced climate variations, assessing future impacts, and hence providing a capability to adapt to climate change and to explore mitigation strategies. These models are crucial for understanding some of the most critical climate issues of today. Major economic decisions of national importance are being made on issues impacted by climate without being based on the best possible science.These resources will also be utilized for a number of shorter-range meteorological research projects, including the development of next generation weather and climate forecast models, National Test Bed, and Satellite Data Assimilation projects. They will also facilitate applied meteorological research and development for purposes of improving and creating short-term warning and weather forecast systems, Huricane Forecast Improvement, models, and observing technology.","NOAA has a gap between the requirements for Research and Development (R&amp;D) High Performance Computing (HPC) and the R&amp;D HPC resources that are available.  From a climate modeling perspective the software to increase model resolution, resolve the stratosphere, add global carbon cycle, and add chemistry to address air quality and global climate change is ready. What is lacking is the necessary HPC capacity to run this software to the levels required to realize the maximum benefits and timescales that the models can provide.The NOAA Science Advisory Board established requirements to improve hurricane track and intensity forecasts. One requirement is to reduce the error in a 48 hour forecast; another is to produce 1 km resolution hurricane forecasts. Both of these requirements require computational resources that exceed NOAA s current HPC capabilities.The existing NOAA R&amp;D HPC resources allow NOAA to make steady progress in meeting the above mentioned requirements, and others, but at a slower pace then what NOAA scientists and other stakeholders require.If the R&amp;D program is not fully funded then the program will need to cut back on the available HPC resources that can be provided to its stakeholders. This would translate to such things as reductions in available computing hours that could be made available to NOAA scientists, reduction in network capabilities, impacts to the overall HPC infrastructure components (i.e. facility, security, support services, contracts, and contract support). The gap between requirements and resources would widen.","Increase Number of regional scale projections for assessments &amp; decision support from 2 to 3 per year.Increase Oak Ridge research system peak computational performance from 260 TF to 980 TF.Complete construction and begin operations  in the NOAA Environmental Security Computing Center (NESCC) in Fairmont, WV.Deliver, install, and test new 333 TF development system at the NESCC.Complete N-WAVE network and begin operations.Deliver and install new augmentation to Hurricane Forecast Improvement (HFIP) R&amp;D system.","CY:NESCC development system becomes operational.HFIP R&amp;D augmentation becomes operational.Increase Oak Ridge research system peak computational performance  from 980 TF to 1,106 TF (1 PF).Eliminate R&amp;D computer operations at vendor provided  facility in Gaithersburg, MD.Decrease Percentage of uncertainty in possible 21st century sea level rise (0-1m &#61; 100% uncertainty).Improved treatment of key physical processes in climate models aimed at improving: model performance, understanding of uncertainties, and confidence in climate change projections and predictions.Deliver next HFIP R&amp;D system augmentation.BY:Increase Cumulative number of new decadal prototype forecasts and predictions made with high-resolution coupled climate model.Increase Number of regional scale projections for assessments &amp; decision support from 5 to 7.HFIP R&amp;D augmentation becomes operational.",279.519,29.936,30.936,30.936,2006.0,2020.0,The prior funding summary was submitted while NOAA's American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) spend plan and FY10 OMB submission were not yet complete.

The HRMS system will be deployed using an OPM certified HRLoB Shared Solution Center (SSC) and will be deployed in a phased approach to address the functions defined within the Human Resources Management segment within the DOC segment architecture.A modern HRMS will significantly streamline the processing of HR transactions, provide much needed visibility into and accessibility to HR data, and covert the data to knowledge that will support the DOC administration s goal for Human Capital strategic planning.  The selected solution will support integration with and/or ease of migration from existing HR core systems (e.g., WebTA, NFC Payroll, Commerce Learning Center). A web-based HRMS will provide self-service functionality that enables managers and employees to easily manage personnel information and make strategic decisions while reengineering the core personnel processes provided by HR professionals. Self-service functionality will dramatically transform and streamline how DOC employees, managers and HR staff perform their work resulting in increase efficiencies and effectiveness that translates to greater productivity.  This self-service functionality will significantly expand the availability of real-time information to support strategic planning, workforce planning and related executive decision-making and planning activities.This investment directly supports the following management support functions:  Benefits Management   Compensation Management   Employee Relations   Human Resources Development   Human Resources Strategy   Labor Relations  Organization and Position Management  Performance Management  Separation Management  Staff Acquisition.","The provision of HR services at the Agency is primarily a manual effort with limited automation.

Additionally, the Agency has standardized on the use of the following systems:  WebTA   time and attendance  Monster Government Solutions - recruiting  Learn.com   learning managementIn addition to these systems, the bureaus/offices have implemented a number of cuff systems to address the lack of HR process automation. The proliferation of cuff systems has created an environment of increased complexity, process inefficiencies and security/privacy risk.  The deficiencies inherent in the current environment and negative operational impacts that will be addressed by this investment include:  Limited validation functionality that leads to inability to trap processing errors prior to processing through the payroll interface resulting in re-work, additional labor costs, inaccurate payments, etc.  Manually intensive and non-standardized HR processes across the enterprise that result in inefficient and ineffective processing, increased labor costs and reduced data confidence.  Labor intensive interaction with current HR system of record that provides limited functionality, is not user friendly and is difficult to navigate.  Increased complexity and cost related to the development and maintenance of large number of cuff systems to substitute for lack of HR process automation.   Excessive labor costs given lack of a paperless workflow (end-to-end) process and duplication of effort.  Prolonged staff acquisition cycles that negatively impact mission operations and business and administrative support requirements.  Significant increase in risk of privacy breaches given paper transfer of PII in order to process HR actions.

It provides national and global real-time exchange services using automated communications resources to collect and distribute a wide variety of environmental data such as observations, analysis, and forecast products. The NWSTG is the data source for the Family of Services data distribution and the data broadcast for the Emergency Manager's Weather Information Network. These time perishable products are distributed ensure the fastest availability of the information. The NWSTG is operated 24x7 to acquire data, process observations, construct messages, and disseminate messages and files of observations, model analysis, and forecast products. The NWSTG facilitates every NWS GPRA goal including: Tornado Warning Lead Time, Flash Flood Warning Lead Time, Winter Storm Warnings Lead Time, and Hurricane Track Forecasts. Thousands of customers worldwide use data distributed by the NWSTG and these data affect a wide range of economic and emergency management decisions. NWSTG is vulnerable to natural disasters, human error, computer viruses, hacker attackers, and terrorism.  If the NWSTG failed, more than 90% of the in situ weather observations necessary for numerical weather prediction models would be lost and forecast accuracy would be degraded. The Backup Telecommunications Gateway mitigates to a degree the NWSTG as a single point of failure by providing limited backup operations for the primary systems within 12 hours of a failure. This limited backup capability is currently inadequate and efforts are underway to implement a full backup capability by FY13.   Projected volumes of observational and weather forecast and warning information cannot be managed with the current system architecture. The projected data processing requirements dictate a new, scalable system architecture with the inherent design flexibility to expand to process increased environmental products resulting from programs including Next Generation Air Transportation System, Dual Polarization, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series and Joint Polar Satellite System. The aging infrastructure, along with the significant increase in processing requirements, represent a major threat to disrupt or degrade the availability, accuracy, and timeliness of critical products and services that emergency managers and the public rely on during severe weather and electromagnetic events.","This investment allows NOAA to ensure that the NWSTG reliably meets performance demands and will allow the NWS to maintain operations should the NWSTG primary system fail. This investment provides the NWSTG sufficient performance and capacity to meet current and near-term demands for data throughput and message transit times. Five year projections for daily NWSTG system throughput indicate an almost threefold increase in data volume from 1.2TB to 3.1TB. The investment was approved by NOAA IT Review Board and Commerce IT Review Board. It has been identified as an essential government resource in Presidential Decision Directive - 67 Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations. This investment ensures uninterrupted delivery of critical meteorological data necessary for the protection of life and property, and the economic well being of the Nation. In FY 2011, the NWSTG received overall rating of 2.5 (red) in OMB's IT Dashboard from the Department of the Commerce Chief Information Office.  This overall rating was based on: aging infrastructure, limited backup capabilities, and the inability to support increased data volume projections. To address these deficiencies, a two part strategy was developed and a request for funding included in the FY13 President's Budget: Technology Re-alignment (FY11-FY13) and Technology Re-architecture (FY11-FY15). Without this investment, the NWSTG will not have the capacity to meet customer and operational requirements and address the deficiencies identified in OMB's IT Dashboard assessment.  The aging infrastructure, along with the significant increase in processing requirements, represent a major threat to disrupt or degrade the availability, accuracy, and timeliness of critical products and services that emergency managers and the public rely on during severe weather and electromagnetic events.

006-000525200,6,Department of Commerce,8,Economic and Statistical Analysis,"BEA, one of the world's leading statistical agencies, provides some of the most closely watched U.S. economic statistics that influence critical financial decisions made by governments, businesses, and households. BEA collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies, and disseminates statistics to the public. BEA's single mission area is supported by one major system, the BEA Estimation IT System (BEA-EITS), which is a portfolio of highly integrated and interdependent statistical and economic estimation subsystems. This system encompasses the Bureau's core economic processing system and is the primary tool used in the production of the BEA's economic accounts. The BEA-EITS forms the technological foundation for achieving the strategic and performance goals of improved timeliness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of BEA's economic statistical releases. Rapid and far-reaching changes in the economy, loss of key source data, and the ongoing need to update concepts and estimation methods drive BEA's Strategic Plan. This Plan emphasizes four key objectives:1) Efficiently manage IT investments in support of BEA's mission, vision, and strategic objectives; 2) Redesign core systems and applications to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and comprehensives of Bureau outputs; 3) Standardize data structures and databases to use web-technologies to improve the collection, access, and dissemination of data; and 4) Maintain infrastructure to ensure reliability and security. Ongoing upgrades to the various components of the BEA-EITS are driven by BEA's strategic goals and objectives. As a statistical production and analytical agency, IT systems are not secondary support structures, but are central to the core function of the Bureau.  The O&amp;M funds provided by this investment will allow BEA to continue the timely, relevant, and accurate release of more than 50 critical statistical estimates measuring U.S. economic activity.  The DME portion of this investment will be applied to consolidate systems and data stores into integrated components, with state-of-the-art analytic capabilities, significantly faster processing cycles, flexibility to incorporate methodological improvements required to measure a rapidly changing economy, and enhanced internal and external data access.  This investment will provide timely and accurate statistics used by decision-makers to make investment decisions and create jobs.","In times of economic uncertainty, the two most closely watched economic indicators are GDP produced by BEA, and employment statistics produced by BLS.This investment is designed around 4 specific objectives, which combine to provide BEA with the tools necessary to adapt to the new economy: (1)Significantly increase the efficiency of the Bureau's computational processing cycle thus widening the critical window available for analysis;(2)Provide a stable platform on which cutting-edge analytical tools can be developed;(3)Make possible the flexibility required to adapt methodologies in response to a rapidly changing economy; and(4)Enable the rapid dissemination of data to policy makers.Continuing uncertainty on the state of the economy emphatically underlines the need to invest to assure BEA's ability to reliably produce accurate, timely, and up to date statistics.  Bureau analysts have found it difficult to respond to requests for more current and new statistics, such as the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, consumer spending, Regional impact of Gulf oil spill, more current industry growth statistics, and responses to questions about impact of European debt crisis.  To address the considerable methodological and computational challenges related to measuring a rapidly changing economy, BEA initiated a statistical production modernization program two years ago. The first project produced a working flexible GDP IT system which is a processing model that can be effectively applied to the rest of BEA's production processes.  This new system reduced processing time for GDP benchmark estimates from 72 hours to 30 minutes.  The new GDP system was also used to generate US territorial GDP statistics, per request from Department of Interior.  These new statistics were generated without the need to modify any code, saving months of work and underscoring the flexibility of the system.The O&amp;M and DME initiatives included in this investment are critical to prevent errors and delays in key statistical releases with large potential adverse economic, political, and regional implications. For example, the 2003 Benchmark estimation processing was very lengthy, resulting in delays in data releases. The new GDP processing system produced in the first statistical production modernization project made the 2009 Benchmark release the smoothest ever.  Each processing was cycle reduced from 72 hours to 30 minutes, greatly widening the critical window for analysis.","In FY2011, BEA completed its highest priority initiatives supporting the Bureau's external customers, making processing systems more efficient, and further strengthening the security of BEA's infrastructure.  For external customers, BEA completed timely, relevant, and accurate release of 56 critical statistical estimates measuring U.S. economic activity; and continued to simplify the electronic survey reporting process resulting in reduced respondent burden.  BEA enhanced dynamic web applications and web site search capabilities, streamlining access to data.To improve processing systems, the bureau developed a new system for top level aggregation of U.S. Balance of Payments statistics; and continued parallel testing of the combined national income and GDP processing system.  Finally, BEA spent a great deal of time and resources on initiatives to strengthen IT security while responding to ever increasing FISMA compliance requirements such as credential scanning and TIC.","Each year we will continue the timely, relevant, and accurate release of over 50 critical statistical estimates measuring U.S. economic activity. We will continue to meet critical strategic plan targets supporting the Bureau's external customers, making processing systems more efficient, and further strengthening the security of BEA's infrastructure. BEA will deploy IPv6 on public/external facing components.  BEA will continue a robust IT security continuous monitoring program including rigorous internal and external testing to identify opportunities to further strengthen BEA s IT security posture.  Major IT security enhancements are planned including expanding audit logging, We will continue to emphasize the Bureau's statistical production modernization program, and the pace of the program will depend on the level of funding available.  BEA's 5-year modernization plan includes improvements in all program areas.",89.324,15.5563,12.77212,13.0707,2002.0,2018.0,"1.

The Census Bureau s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program has demonstrated in the pilot stage the power and usefulness of linking multiple business/employee data sets with state-of-the-art confidentiality protections to build a longitudinal national frame of jobs.A new initiative was proposed to launch the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) program, leveraging and building on the external/internal investments of the LEHD pilot program. This enhanced program supports the Department of Commerce plan to improve American competitiveness and measures of innovation, and provide federal, state, and local policymakers and planners, businesses, private sector decision makers, and Congress with comprehensive and timely national, state, and local information on the dynamic nature of businesses and their workers.   The LED program significantly reduces the overall cost for the generation of its quarterly data product by leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars invested in exiting federal and state data and avoiding costs required to expand existing surveys to collect the information directly. This initiative will provide the data needed by Federal, state and local policymakers and planners, businesses and private sector decision-makers, and the Congress, with the full range of information on firm and worker changes they need. Labor market research organizations, economic development organizations, university researchers, labor market researchers, the insurance industry, and government agencies will all potentially benefit from these data to help them in areas such as transportation infrastructure planning, labor market research, and identification of labor shortages.The LED program has a strong commitment to Census Enterprise Architecture (EA) and security.  All computer system operating and support structure is directed towards a centrally-managed EA with the goal of aligning the program's Information Technology (IT) and business strategies to help reduce operating costs and avoid duplicate and nonintegrated systems.

The National Climatic Data Center is responsible for the perpetual stewardship, archiving, and dissemination of climatological and environmental data.  There are significant demands on the NCDC to provide information to the Nation and the World community.  NCDC data and information products are available as part of a national decision support system for the purpose of saving lives and protecting property and enhancing the economic prosperity and quality of life in the United States.  NCDC strategic objectives are dependent upon the use of extended environmental and climatological data and information periods of record. There is continued improvement and economic benefit to our Nation obtained from continued access to the rapidly increasing volume of historical data. NCDC is located in Asheville, NC. NCDC must be able to integrate data from various observing systems.  There is also a need for data at common space and time scales to be stored and accessible in formats that can be easily interchanged.  NCDC's Scientific Data Stewardship (SDS) projects are focused on two product types:  Climate Data Records (CDRs) and Climate Information Records (CIRs).  The SDS project is mainly focused on the generalization, application and validation of mature algorithms over multiple environmental satellites and sensors which together span climate-relevant time periods. NCDC has formed partnerships with numerous agencies i.e., Department of Defense (DOD), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); within NOAA with the National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and the National Weather Service (NWS).  NWS, NOS and OAR supports NCDC's work on various projects such as the Climate Reference Network (CRN), the NOAA Climate Services Portal, and the NOAA Climate Model Portal.  NCDC manages NOAA's enterprise data archive system, the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) to archive large amounts of weather and climate data generated by the NESDIS environmental satellite programs.  Other investments that collaborate with NCDC, include the National Oceanographic and Geophysical Data Centers, the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) and U.S. Regional Climate Reference Network (USRCRN).","The NCDC works to close these gaps by allowing the Nation to be prepared to mitigate the effects of climate and weather extremes that are amplified by changes in population.

The services of the Mission Support contract are for critical functions to include computer operations, IT security management, and customer order fulfillment.Funding loss to the Climate Data Records (CDR) program would severely impact the Nation's ability to 1) make observation-informed decisions by sectors affected by climate trends and variability (e.g., Energy, Coastal Planning, Agriculture, Defense, Transportation, Finance/Insurance), 2) manage, use and reuse data from legacy and future satellite systems (e.g., POES, GOES, DMSP and their successors), and 3) improve predictive modeling of climate change, adaptation and mitigation scenarios. CDR funding cuts would terminate competitive grants, multiple contract positions, salaries for scientists and would prohibit the purchase of IT hardware needed to process satellite data.","NCDC transitioned three satellite-derived Climate Data Records from research to operationally produced and sustained climate records.  The three CDRS delivered included global calibrated records for Earth-reflected solar radiation, Earth-emitted infrared (thermal) energy, and water vapor in the upper troposphere as measured from the GOES and POES programs.  Work to digitize NWS Cooperative Observer Program paper records continued with the goal of eliminating paper submissions entirely in the near future.  NCDC rescued data across NOAA through the Climate Database Modernization Program.  The CDMP has greatly improved the preservation of and access to NOAA's holdings by migrating many resources to digital media.  The CDMP program had placed online over 54 million weather and environmental images that are available to researchers around the world via the Internet.  This year CDMP projects included the preservation of aerial photography images of the U.S. coast lines back to the 1920s.","CY: NCDC operations continue to operate at a computer systems availability rate of more than 98%, ensuring highly reliable ingest, archive and customer access to critical climate data and information.

This effort has four major goals: Improve the relevance and timeliness of census long-form data; Reduce operational risk; Improve the accuracy of census coverage; and contain costs. This investment supports business processes for census operations including capturing data from self-responding households and collecting GPS data for every address. These IT systems must be integrated and work together and are defined by the methodological requirements of the operations those systems support. The major components of this investment are: Field Data Collection Automation, which includes Global Positioning System-equipped hand held computers for use by address canvassers; software applications to deliver and control their assignments, capture and transmit data, and integrate all systems on the instrument; and personnel, payroll, and field office control systems. Decennial Response Integration System includes response capture processing, the core system that will accept and integrate data inputs from multiple sources, and provides data needed by other systems for census operations, including follow-up operations, coverage measurement, census evaluations, post-response data processing systems, and geographic processing. Headquarters Systems is a group of IT systems consisting of those that are currently in place to support planning, development, and testing activities and an integrated set of tasks oriented towards the development of requirements, acquisition plans, and acquisition for the major infrastructure systems that support the 2010 Census activities of Census Bureau headquarters divisions. It also includes investments needed to improve decennial census Capability Maturity Model practices. By FY 2013, most of the major 2010 Census activities will be completed. Remaining activities include Census Program for Evaluations and Experiments, Count Question Resolution, and Archiving.  Interdependencies exist between the 2010 Census Program and 1) the DADS investment, DADS processes and disseminates decennial data; 2) the MAF/TIGER investment, in that it provided the updated address list for the census; and 3) the IT Infrastructure investment, which provides the everyday systems and programs used at HQ for oversight and management.","The re-engineered 2010 Decennial Census Program was built on the lessons learned coming out of Census 2000.

006-000401400,6,Department of Commerce,7,Bureau of the Census,"The 2020 Census will conduct a census of population and housing and disseminate data to the President, the States, and the American people. The Census Bureau is committed to designing and conducting a 2020 Census that costs less per housing unit than the 2010 Census while maintaining high quality results. The vision of the 2020 Census is an efficient and quality census that counts people, once, only once, and in the right place.The Census Bureau has identified 4 strategic goals for the 2020 Census: Complete and accurate census; embraced and valued results; an efficient census; and a well-managed census. To achieve these goals, the Census Bureau must make fundamental changes to the design, implementation, and management of the decennial census.This investment covers the Research and Testing (R&amp;T) Phase (FY 12-14). The 2020 Census R&amp;T approach is to complete decisions about preliminary operational designs by Sept 2014 but mount remaining developments later in the decade. Specifically, the focus of FY 13 activities will be to support the research and testing infrastructure, allowing us to effectively test new enumeration methods, new processes to support field operations, more cost-effective IT systems, and address and spatial frame-related methods needed for the 2020 Census to supplement research being carried out in the geographic support (GEO) program. Additionally, focus will be on full implementation of program management and systems engineering activities to ensure effective management and technical/operational cohesion of research and testing projects.The 2020 Census program will take advantage of related work across the Census Bureau. We have identified specific relationships and interactions, between and among program projects and with other initiatives/programs, particularly with the expansion of the GEO program in FY 11. Below is a summary of the interdependencies.-Supplement research included in the GEO program. To ensure no duplication of effort, clear project-by-project delineation will be decided to guide which activities belong in the GEO program and which are required for 2020 Census independent research-Identify high-priority evaluations and experiments within the 2010 Census Program of Evaluations and Experiments (CPEX). -Integrate appropriate testing into the American Community Survey infrastructure-Integrate key components of the field infrastructure into all planning.","The Census Bureau plans to conduct a 2020 Census at a lower cost per housing unit than in 2010 (as calculated per housing unit on an inflation-adjusted basis). The approach is to build on lessons learned from previous censuses, while addressing societal and technologic trends. This investment supports the FY 2012-2014 Research and Testing Phase of the 2020 Census Program, enabling the Census Bureau to make key IT and programmatic design decisions based on solid research early in the decade. It also supports DOC strategic objective &quot;Generating and communicating new, cutting-edge scientific understanding of technical, economic, social, and environmental systems.&quot;The requested funding will enable the Census Bureau to successfully research and test innovations intended to decrease cost while maintaining or increasing quality. Further, this approach allows for early design decisions mitigating potential risk later in the decade. Specifically, the Census Bureau will focus on: integrating key program controls; iterating the planning and budgeting process, allowing planning and design flexibility; and making evidence-based decisions derived from research and testing. These strategies will work together to contain downstream costs, without compromising quality. The work done in FY 2012-2014 lays the groundwork needed to achieve the 2020 Census goals.  In FY 2012, the Census Bureau will focus on identifying design options for automating field operations, developing a centralized Headquarters IT infrastructure, developing workload management applications, and prototyping an administrative records database for non-response.  In FY 2013, we will focus on testing and eliminating options and beginning design work on the design of a Virtual Local Census Office (LCO), as well as the use of it as a test bed for further design and prototyping work. In FY 2014, design decisions will be made about the logic for the IT investments.The Census Bureau components benefitting from this new approach to a decennial Census include: Current Survey programs in the Demographic Programs Directorate, the American Community Survey Office, the 2020 Decennial Census Program, the Field Directorate, the Technology Management Office, the IT Directorate, the Geography Division, the Office of the Senior Advisor for Project Management, and the Data Access and Dissemination Systems Office.

The Environmental Satellite Processing Center (ESPC) is NOAA's primary data processing and distribution system for the Nation's satellite-derived environmental products and services.Benefits and Beneficiaries.  ESPC operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide critical weather and environmental satellite products and services to NOAA customers, such as NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) and National Ocean Service (NOS), DoD, other federal agencies, state and local groups, and the private sector, as required to protect life and property, and provide for the well being of the United States. ESPC benefits NOAA's mission to to predict weather extremes and to monitor sea levels, water resources, and marine ecosystems. ESPC operates, maintains, and secures the systems that ingest satellite and other data, generates satellite-based products, and distributes them to NOAA's customers.Management.  ESPC is managed by the DOC/NOAA/NESDIS/Office of Satellite and Products Operations (OSPO), which was formed in an FY11 reorganization.  In FY10, ESPC removed all development activities from their work. Phases 1 and 2 of the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) system became operational and the CIP development activities for later phases were moved to the NESDIS Office of Systems Development (OSD).  The new ESPC contract, ESPDS-O&amp;M covers operation, maintenance, and security of ESPC.     Delivery of Products and Services.  ESPC processes data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES), and non-NOAA satellites.  The environmental products generated and distributed include vertical atmospheric measurements (soundings), low-level winds, sea surface heights and temperatures, and marine ecosystem parameters like chlorophyll concentrations indicating algal blooms.  ESPC also provides operational satellite distribution services which provide customers with environmental information via satellite.Dependencies.  For product, service, and infrastructure improvements, ESPC depends on the Satellite Operations Control Center and Command and Data Acquisition Stations (SOCC-CDAS)  satellite data downloads and transmission to ESPC.  CIP provides improvements in disaster recovery capability. For new ground system data ingest and new satellites ESPC depends on OSD (which includes GOES-GS, POES-GS,CIP, Jason-3, and NDE), GOES-R, and Joint Polar Satellite Systems (JPSS).","ESPC is NOAA's primary data processing system for environmental data.  ESPC maximizes the benefits of a common IT environment by combining processes, eliminating redundancies, lowering IT refresh costs, reducing O&amp;M costs, and enforcing standard operating procedures (SOPs).  If ESPC is not fully funded,  the data downloaded from the NOAA operational environmental satellites and international satellites are not reformatted for use and products are not produced and distributed to users as part of meeting Department of Commerce Goal 3.1 &quot;Advance understanding and predict changes in the Earth's environment to meet America's economic, social, and environmental needs&quot;.","ESPC accomplishments in FY2011 (PY) include:-  Achievement of the ESPC 3 year Authorization to Operate (ATO) awarded in April 2011,-  Ongoing support to the conversion of the telecommunications system from FTS2000 to NETWORXX,-  Operational support to the Jason-3 ground system,-  Prepare operationally for the October 2011 NPP satellite launch,-  Implementation of the Antarctic Data Acquisition (ADA) operational deployment,-  Adding automated monitoring functionality to ESPC servers,-  Finalized OSPO security policies as part of ESPC's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) -  Operational support to the Polar Metop-B deployment to operations, -  Meeting or exceeding ESPC operational performance metrics targets every month.","Planned accomplishments for Current Year (CY) 2012 include:- Continue to meet or exceed ESPC system performance targets,- Deploy operationally into the ESPC system boundary:     (1) the National Ice Center (NIC) Satellite Image Processing and Analysis System (SIPAS) system,     (2) the POES Metop-B product generation and distribution modifications, and- Complete scheduled IT Refresh activities:     (1) Deploy VMware to improve baseline configuration recovery and management,     (2) Deploy software changes for GOES-15 becoming operational as GOES-West,     (3) Deploy Scheduler software replacement,     (4) Refresh ESPC desktop systems,     (5) Provide labor to refresh the ESPC LAN.Planned accomplishments for Budget Year (BY) 2013 include:-  Continue to meet or exceed ESPC system performance targets,-  Deploy operationally into the ESPC system boundary;     (1) Ingest system upgrades,     (2) Distribution of validated Key Performance Parameter (KPP) EDRs from the NPP satellite data, and     (3) Distribution of validated products from polar Metop-B satellite data.

006-000312500,6,Department of Commerce,48,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"This investment represents NOAA's commitment to the multi agency Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative, and will result in the development and deployment of the NextGen 4-Dimensional (4-D) Weather Data Cube described in the NextGen Integrated Work Plan.  This  Cube  is characterized by:a)  Improvements to IT infrastructure comparable to those already employed by other governmental agencies and by industry to provide greater and easier access to NOAA weather information for aviation decision-makers.  Greater access to aviation relevant weather information will facilitate better integration of this information into aviation user s decision-making processes.b)  More consistent aviation weather information, providing a common operational weather picture needed for colaborative decision making across the National Airspace System.c)  Improvements to accuracy of weather information.  The research and development (R&amp;D) needed to meet NextGen's stringent weather forecast accuracy requirements will be an extended, multi-year effort.  This long lead-time R&amp;D will underpin more accurate aviation weather information including improved prediction of local weather (such as thunderstorms), improved forecast confidence (reduction of uncertainty), and reduction of false alarm rate.  This improved guidance forms the foundation to which forecasters add their expertise to develop the official forecast supporting NextGen goals.d)  Improvements to aviation forecast generation techniques.  NWS meteorologists require advanced tools and techniques to enable faster, more accurate generation of aviation weather information.While this investment is intended to benefit the aviation community, improvements to IT infrastructure, improved forecast accuracy, and more advanced forecast processes will have wider reaching benefits across NOAA and to governmental and private sectors that use environmental information.  These results will be leveraged by other NWS service areas, such as support to Emergency Managers, and improved forecasts for severe weather notification or flood warnings to the public.  NOAA, other governmental agencies, private industry, and the public will have more effective and efficient access to accurate, consistent, and timely weather information to drive their decision-making systems and processes.","The multi-agency NextGen Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) has developed a plan to accommodate the expected growth in demand, which will allow for the reduction of air traffic delays. A critical component of the NextGen plan is the integration of weather information into air traffic operations. To enable this integration, the plan requires the creation of rapidly updated, high-resolution probabilistic weather information consistent across space and time and accessible to all NAS managers and users through a network-enabled infrastructure. Meteorologists will utilize and produce this information, using enhanced forecast processes to add value to forecast guidance and rapidly updated gridded datasets produced by automation. This capability does not presently exist within the federal government, and the JPDO partner agencies are depending on NOAA, as the federal experts in the provision of weather information, to deliver it.Failure to fund this initiative will halt the NWS's ability to support the legislatively-mandated, multi-agency NextGen initiative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's airspace system.  DOC will not be able to carry out its responsibility to develop and deploy a NextGen 4-D Weather Data Cube for aviation users by 2014, and continued system and model improvements will not be achieved after 2014, as required by the NextGen Integrated Work Plan.  The FY2011 budget dispute and continued uncertainty in the long term budget profile have already delayed the implementation of this capability by over 1 year.  Elimination of the program will necessitate the continuation of current ad hoc, inefficient use of stove-piped weather capabilities within NOAA and the FAA, thereby negating the ability for air traffic managers to make sound, informed decisions based on common and consistent information on weather impacting aircraft routes and airports.  Elimination of the program will also stall improvements to higher-resolution modeling needed to more precisely predict the leading edge of thunderstorms affecting air routes, downbursts that affect aircraft take-off and landing, and hail and intense rain that affect all phases of flight operations, thereby inhibiting any reduction to air traffic delays and preventing the reuse of these capabilities by other NWS service areas.",- Conducted end-to-end proof of concept with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to validate conceptual design - Coordinated with NOAA/NWS program ensuring NWS Enterprise alignment. - System functional and performance requirements finalized in preparation for acquisition - 4-D Cube Draft RFP was released focusing on &quot;&quot;Cloud&quot;&quot; solution in a dedicated service-centric vehicle to meet NWS Executive guidance.,"Planned FY12 activities include:1 NextGen 4-D Weather Data Cube Services and Infrastructure development: Software and systems prototyped in prior years will be made ready to transition from the research environment to operations. This activity will begin in FY 2012 to ensure readiness to complete Operational Testing and Evaluation and deployment of this Initial Operational Capability (IOC) as scheduled in FY 2014.2. Integration of diverse forecasts into a consistent weather picture: Develop techniques and processes to evaluate disparate forecasts of individual weather parameters and examine methods to consolidate these forecasts into a Single Authoritative Source (SAS) of weather aviation information.3. Tools and techniques for the generation of legacy aviation products from digital sources: Legacy aviation forecast products are largely text based and have been generated in essentially the same manner for the past 50 years. Tools and techniques must be developed to allow these products to be derived from digital weather information generated at NWS facilities. This capability is an essential element in the reduction of inconsistencies currently found in aviation products.4. Expanded R&amp;D capabilities to meet NextGen MOC requirements: Initiate research and development (R&amp;D) in advanced weather observation and prediction to meet critical NextGen MOC requirements. The focus of FY 2012 activities will be on advanced numerical weather prediction models, enhanced forecast processes and the development of tools enabling forecasters to add value to automatically generated weather information sets.The FY13 DOC Budget contains no funding for NextGen activities, therefore none are planned.",6.11,6.285,16.285,16.199,2010.0,2025.0,The FY13 APpropriation reduced NextGen funding from a requested $33.340M to $16.285M.

Included in this investment are the costs associated with Employee Compensation, Benefits, Training and Field Travel, Software License Maintenance, Hardware Maintenance, Cyber-Security Services, Contractor Support, and Telecommunication Circuits and Usage.To improve and enhance the USPTO s current IT systems and services, the OCIO is currently managing multiple enterprise-wide DME programs.  Each program has potential impacts on some, or in some cases nearly all, of the IT services and Business Area AISs.  The programs which comprise the DME portion of this investment include: (1) Business Continuity &amp; Disaster Recovery (BC/DR), (2) Data Center Stabilization, (3) Desktop Stabilization, (4) Service Desk Stabilization, and (5) Telecommunications Stabilization.The OCIO operates and maintains more than 100 Automated Information Systems (AISs), and it is critical that they remain fully operational and are repaired quickly, as their downtime translates directly to lost productivity in the business areas served by those AISs.The activities for the OCIO s office include O&amp;M for Infrastructure Systems as well as O&amp;M in support of the Business Area s AISs.  The OCIO priorities for O&amp;M work are generally to:  (1) perform corrective maintenance in response to problem notifications and trouble tickets, (2) provide daily operations and production support, (3) performing adaptive maintenance such as upgrading AISs to respond to new laws and regulations, (4) performing maintenance such as upgrading AISs to their underlying operating software or to improve performance, and (5) making minor enhancements to AISs as time allows.","This investment encompasses the day-to-day Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) to support the USPTO s IT systems and infrastructure as well as the programs and projects to enhance these systems to meet future needs.The Development, Modernization and Enhancement (DME) components of this investment were identified in FY 2008 as systems performance and the corresponding fragility of applications limited the ability of the OCIO to provide services that were fully supportive of the Agency mission.The degradation of the IT infrastructure was further exacerbated by a lack of consistent change and configuration management.  The USPTO lacked a disaster recovery process or plan to protect Agency data and to support the restoration of services in the event of a catastrophe. Finally, the OCIO s budget as a percentage of the USPTO budget had remained steady for many years, even while the Agency workforce had rapidly expanded.The consequences of not addressing these issues included: An increase in the number of critical-system failures Escalating security vulnerabilities amid continuously evolving threats Cumbersome development and deployment processes An increased reliance on contractors/vendors to maintain systems Rising support and operational costs  Reduced ability, or even inability, to respond quickly to incidents An increasing gap in USPTO s ability to recover from a disaster or major disruption Hardware and software operated beyond industry standard lifespan and support Inability to support the increasing workforce, use of telework and international work-sharing opportunities.OCIO management recognized that these challenges if not immediately addressed, would continue to degrade IT services to the point that the mission of the Agency would be jeopardized and as such formulated a comprehensive effort to address them.This effort was structured as a multi-year portfolio of programs including:  Data Center Stabilization, Telecommunications Stabilization, Service Desk Stabilization, Desktop Standardization, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery.The major goals of the portfolio are:1.Stabilize the existing infrastructure environment2.Consolidate the existing infrastructure and application systems to avoid unnecessary duplication and excessive cost3.Optimize the IT infrastructure to improve performance, facilitate governance, and ensure compliance4.Maintain and enhance the services delivered to customers.","Replaced end of life storage at Boyers facilityDeployed an Internet Point of Presence at Boyers facilityConducted study to reduce paper application at Boyers facilityImplemented Enterprise Configuration Management Scope and FrameworkModified UPS power source in IT West from Piller to building powerConducted study to select appliances for automatic password changesReplaced outdated rack mounted serversUpgraded data center inventory S/W and conducted data collectionProcured Remedy S/W, planned architecture and compiled foundation dataProcured H/W and development services for Service DeskDeployed Incident, Knowledge and Problem management modulesPrepared and deployed over 3,000 Universal LaptopsProcured RSA tokens to enable two-factor authentication in Outlook Web AccessCompleted PTONetIII Network Access Control IOCCompleted Carlyle Place VOIP ReplacementDeveloped IPV6 Implementation PlanImplemented Technical RefreshImplemented Server Replacement.","Replace old AIX serversReplace end of life serversImplement disk to disk to tape backup strategy to retire the ageing ETBSImplement workflow module for Aperture VISTA databaseConduct pilot for auto-deploymentMigrate HP OpenView to LinuxRemove existing floor service switches from the server roomStand up JBoss environmentsEvaluate various COTS solution for password management automationDeploy logical mapping tool for AISs in production environmentReplace and update H/W and S/W used by Office of Human Resource and Office of FinanceReconfigure IT West Data Center and build up testing environmentsReplace Celerra, Clarion, and DMX storage devicesReplace Net app storage devicesReplace SAN care monitoring toolDeploy NAS virtualizationComplete ITSM Phases 3 and 4 to deploy change and release management modules, along with implementation of the federated Configuration Management systems and remaining ITSM modulesDeploy Universal Laptop to all government employeesCollect replaced equipment to significantly cut down on licensing feesImplement a notification system to augment the Altiris deployment solutionImplement the deployment solution to augment the Altiris deployment solutionImplement an internet/VPN/remote access client to augment the Altiris solutionFurther stabilize the desktop through increased Desktop Rights Management as mandated by the OMB by limiting the local administrative rights (LAR)Create a White List through a Privilege Management Software to allow users with justification to have elevated rightsContinue replacing aging and unreliable hardware and equipmentDevelop Disaster Recovery Documents Life Cycle StrategyImplement Boyers Infrastructure ExpansionComplete a Unified Business Collaboration System (UBCS)Complete PTONetIII Perimeter NetworkComplete PTONetIII Network Access Control FOCComplete Voice System ReplacementComplete Public and Enterprise Wireless LAN.",255.52527999999998,192.28399,223.22861899999998,240.446179,2009.0,2018.0,"Summary spending for this investment has changed from the FY2011 President's budget request due to re-prioritization and re-allocation of funds for new programs and initiatives.

The initial program includes all transactional CSS systems related to Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) functionality enabled with Service Management functions.  The primary goal of GCSS-MC/LCM is to provide the capabilities specified in the Logistics Operational Architecture (Log OA) resulting in the retirement of legacy applications.The GCSS-MC/LCM exposes timely mission information to Marine Corps operational and CSS commanders, CC/JTF commanders and their staffs and other authorized users.  It exposes information interoperability and common logistics information applications and services across functional areas.  GCSS-MC/LCM allows operating forces commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks.  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 is a subset of the total requirement that focuses on Logistics Management and Execution with Logistics Command and Control requirements necessary to perform those functions in a deployed environment.  Increment 1 is global in scope and it can be deployed under any circumstances, during peace or war, independent of geographical location.  The GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 Capability Development Document approved in December 2005 and the Capability Production Document approved January 2010 established the requirements. Key objectives of the GCSS-MC ORD and the GCSS-MC/CDD include the following:  (1) Deliver integrated functionality across supply, maintenance, transportation, finance, engineering, health, acquisition and manpower systems in accordance with the Marine Corps Log OA; (2) Provide timely information to Marine Corps operational and CSS commanders, CCs and Joint JTF commanders and their staffs and other authorized users; (3) Allow Operating Forces (OPFORS) commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks; and (4) Provide users and operators of logistics processes access to information and applications across the spectrum of conflict regardless of location.","The problem is that our logistics capability does not adequately provide the agility, speed and responsiveness to meet 21st century operating concepts.  There is a continued reliance on a physical logistics footprint to support responsiveness and to make up for lack of reliable and timely information.  GCSS-MC/LCM exposes timely mission information to Marine Corps operational and Combat Service Support Combatant Commanders and Joint Task Force commanders and their staffs, and other authorized users.  It will expose information interoperability and common logistics information applications and services across functional areas. It will allow operating force commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks. GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 provides MAGTFs and elements of the supporting establishment new integrated technology for ground supply, maintenance and service management (i.e., request management and order management roles described by the LOG OA).  Focused on logistics chain management, GCSS-MC employs systems and technologies that enable logistics personnel and commanders to gain total visibility of their equipment readiness and position, to track the location of inbound supplies, and to streamline the warfighter's procedures for requesting support. All of which will enhance the operational reach and combat lethality of the MAGTF.

007-000000186,7,Department of Defense,17,Department of the Navy,"Created to modernize, streamline, and standardize how the Navy manages people, money, programs, equipment and supplies, Navy ERP combines business process reengineering (BPR) and industry best practices to integrate all facets of Navy business operations using a single database to manage shared common data. The program enables Navy compliance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and the Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process.The Navy will realize benefits on many levels. The first major benefit will be realized through legacy system retirement cost avoidance. The system enabled the retirement of 19 systems to date, with 86 more to be retired by 2013, generating a cost avoidance of $533M over the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) (FY10-15). Inventory reductions will also be a benefit as the Single Supply Solution continues to deploy with an expected inventory savings of $134M over the FYDP and expected Return on Investment (ROI) of 2.54 by FY2023. Data validation at time of entry, electronic archiving, increased electronic workflow, system audit trails and standardized report generation are just some of the benefits that will increase business process efficiencies and improve internal control across Systems Commands (SYSCOMS). Finally, Navy ERP will be the key for financial compliance and enable the Navy to achieve auditability and a single system for funds management across all commands.Navy ERP's functionality is categorized by six Master Scenarios (Budget to Authorize, Post to Report, Plan to Perform, Acquire to Dispose, Plan to Pay, and Check-in/Check-out) for Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) alignment. These Master scenarios translate system requirements into interoperable functions that drive reengineering business process effectiveness and efficiency throughout the Navy.The Navy vision calls for a single ERP solution focused on delivering products and services to all commands with minimum investment dollars and resources. The ability to rapidly determine operating force logistical needs and to respond quickly to those requirements through an integrated ERP system is paramount. Navy ERP creates a solution that allows rapid access to information on finances, material, personnel, and other end-to-end process information. The solution is designed to include all common business practices, master data, and organizational elements.","The Navy requires a fully integrated means for planning, acquiring, and managing the Navy's personnel, financial and material resources. Navy ERP will provide a standard set of tools to Navy organizations that will facilitate business process reengineering and provide interoperable data elements for acquisition, financial, and logistics operations.  Navy ERP is a major component of the Navy's Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and will provide a critical link between operating forces and the support echelons. Based on Navy mission needs, and in support of Department of Defense (DoD) and Navy objectives, Navy ERP will fulfill the following required capabilities: Optimize Supply Chain Management subject to fiduciary constraints. Enable business process improvement of end-to-end product life cycle management processes focused on acquisition, financial, and logistics operations.

Existing tactical radio systems were designed with mutually exclusive architectures to perform specific tasks; generally cannot interoperate except with like radios operating a single waveform on a single frequency band; are not capable of simultaneous voice, video, and data operations; and lack the ability to conduct complex network management and facilitate inter-Service interoperability.  JTRS HMS closes this gap by delivering modular, multi-band, multi-mode radios providing Joint interoperable, mobile ad-hoc networked communications connectivity for warfighters at the tactical level.  JTRS HMS is designed to provide secure communication links into the network for small, power-disadvantaged platforms and the Soldier.","Conducted Increment 1, Phase 2 Contractor Development Test(CDT)Conducted AN/PRC-154 Increment 1, Phase 1 Government Development Test(GDT) Part 2 Conducted Two Channel Manpack Increment 1, Phase 2 Government Development Test(GDT) Part 1 Conducted Two Channel Manpack Increment 1, Phase 2 Field Experiment(FE) Part 1 Conducted AN/PRC-154 Increment 1, Phase 1 Field Experiment(FE) Part 2Conducted Two Channel Manpack Increment 1, Phase 2 Limited User Test(LUT) Conducted Max Power(MP) Customer Test/Network ExcursionConducted AN/PRC-154 Verification of Correction of Deficiencies(VCD) Conducted Security Verification Test(SVT) for AN/PRC-154Delivery of MUOS HPA Pre-Engineering Development Models(EDMs)Conducted AN/PRC-154 Increment 1, Phase 1 National Security Agency(NSA) CertificationConducted Increment 1, Phase 1 AN/PRC-154 with Low Rate Initial Production(LRIP) Phase 1 & Incr. 1, Phase 2 Two Channel Manpack with Low Rate Initial Production(LRIP) Phase 2 Milestone C award.","Increment 1, Phase 2 National Security Agency (NSA) Certification for Two Channel ManpackConduct Increment 1, Phase 2 Contractor Development Test (CDT) for Two Channel Manpack with MUOS Applique''Conduct Increment 1, Phase 2 Full Rate Production (FRP) In-process Review for Two Channel ManpackDelivery of MUOS Applique'' Engineering Development Models (EDMs)Delivery of AN/PRC-154 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) unitsDelivery of Two Channel Manpack Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) unitsBegin Full Rate Production (FRP) for AN/PRC-154Conduct Increment 1, Phase 2 Field Experiment (FE) Part 2 for Two Channel ManpackConduct Increment 1, Phase 2 Government Development Test (GDT) Part 2 for Two Channel ManpackConduct Increment 1, Phase 2 Multi-service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOTE) for Two Channel ManpackConduct Government Development Test 2.2 and 2.3 (GDT) for AN/PRC-154Conduct initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE) for AN/PRC-154Conduct Increment 1, Phase 2 Contractor Demonstration Test (CDT) for Two Channel ManpackConduct Initial Operation Capability (IOC) for AN/PRC-154Conduct Cold and Hot Climate Testing for AN/PRC-154Conduct Increment 1, Phase 2 Hot Climate Testing for Two Channel ManpackConduct Delta Multi-service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOTE) with WIN-T IOTE for Two Channel Manpack.

DISS will be comprised of a series of clearance processing business functions codified in existing and to-be-built software systems, and collectively identified as the DISS Family of Systems (FoS). The DISS FoS is comprised of existing capabilities - the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Automated Continuous Evaluation System (ACES) - integrated with a new set of business and technical capabilities embodied in the Joint Verification System (JVS).  DISS will improve information sharing capabilities, accelerate clearance-processing timelines, reduce security vulnerabilities, and increase DoD's security mission capability. DISS is tasked to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an Enterprise System that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community.","Security clearance reform is a top priority for the Department of Defense (DoD).  One of the most pressing issues within the Federal Government is delays in hiring and in-processing personnel. These delays add costs and increase time in completing related contracts and fulfilling agency missions, and create difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified personnel. These problems stem from extended hiring and clearance delays to the detriment of individuals beginning work, continuing work, or moving from one position or agency to another. In response to significant, continuing timeliness concerns, Congress established specific timeliness goals as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).  IRTPA states that all agencies shall reciprocally accept eligibility determinations made by an authorized agency; and requires 90% of all clearances - whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential - to be completed within 60 days.  Additionally, this goal was reinforced in the FY 2012 DoD Strategic Management Plan.  Through an incremental approach, DISS will replace various, outdated personnel security systems enabling the application of consistent standards and the reciprocal recognition of investigations and adjudications. The DISS IT solution will enable the community to meet the requirements of the IRTPA, and will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the Department.  The design of the transformed IT process will ensure timely, cost-transparent, investigations and adjudicative decisions that have met the DoD quality standard.  It will decrease the processing time for an investigation and will further strengthen and reinforce reciprocity by greatly reducing unnecessary investigation requests.If requested funding is not provided, then the DoD may not be able to meet with requirements set forth by IRTPA as currently planned.

007-000000595,7,Department of Defense,97,Department of Defense Agencies,"The Defense Information System Network (DISN) is DoD's consolidated world wide telecommunications infrastructure that provides end-to-end information transport for DoD operations, providing the warfighters and the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) information long-haul transport infrastructure. The primary beneficiaries of the DISN investment are the DoD COCOMs, Military Departments, Defense Agencies and the Warfighter, as well as our mission Allies. The DISN goal remains to seamlessly span the terrestrial and space strategic domains, as well as the tactical domain, to provide the interoperable telecommunications connectivity and value-added services required to plan, implement, and support any operational missions, anytime, and anywhere pushing DISN services to the edge of the communications network. The vision of power to connect is the availability and accessibility of a ubiquitous, secure, robust, trusted, protected, and routinely used wide-bandwidth network, populated with the information and information services that our forces need.The DISN''s primary focus is on sustainment of the existing network. Acquisition fills any requirement deficiencies through a continuous infrastructure modernization to transition to internet protocol (IP) capabilities by replacing or refreshing the optical core to 100G over the FY 2008 - FY 2017 timeframe. Similarly, the Joint World-wide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) fills the requirements of the Intelligence Community through the voice, video and data IP communications infrastructure thereby leveraging the DISN optical core to fill operational needs of the Intelligence Community. Internal DISN interdependencies are focused on the common-user services'' dependencies on the underlying transport infrastructure. Most other DoD IT initiatives are dependent upon, at a minimum, the DISN transport infrastructure for voice, video, and/or data interchange.","As the Department''s global enterprise information transport platform that securely interconnects data sources with data sinks regardless of size and/or location, its filling of performance gaps related to mission execution is critical. The original formation and success of the DISN was tied to the resolution of varied enterprise infrastructure shortfalls identified through a series of OSD internal studies and GAO Audits/DoD IG Findings in the late-1980''s and early 1990''s. Its follow-on expansion and National Defense Mission role both increased and shifted in the late 1990''s and early 2000''s. The move was toward a forward-leaning combat support agency, one more attuned to active support being provided to forward DoD elements and to the provisioning of a robust infrastructure to meet both the deployed and sustaining base roles of the Military Departments and the Combat Commands. The identification and satisfaction of mission needs/requirements became a focused and coordinated effort to ensure funding and delivery of those capabilities to the Warfighter in a timely, expeditious, and cost efficient manner. As deficiencies were noted by the managers, operators, implementers, and customers, changes in operational and program management support and its processes were effected. These activities and their execution are monitored by Department Senior Leadership to ensure delivery of capabilities to the customer in an effective and efficient manner. The customer forums, performance surveys, and customer operational mission requirements are integral as measures of success to every DISN subsystem, their projects and activities, and critical in determining present day system shortfalls. These shortfalls are mapped against the DISN''s planning criteria, prioritzed in concert with the customer base, and programmed for execution as, and when, funding is available.Delayed availability of required funding means that lower priority efforts closing specific performance gaps will be delayed and reprioritized, leaving the related mission risk unresolved. This leaves Department objectives related to converged IT systems at risk and mission assets, including manpower, potentially in harm''s way. DISN management recognized early in the program that global communications infrastructure was not ubiquitous, and DISN implementation would be technology over geography over time/money. The lack of time/money creates an adverse impact to delivering critical power-to-the-edge.","FY11 accomplishments: Continued to sustain the global DISN, with transport removing 35 DATMS nodes and transitioning 35 ATI circuits; JWICS transitioned 60 nodes from ATM to IP, deployed a new core node and optimized 13 others; EPC/SECN performed site surveys, engineering analysis, and contract actions for 4 switch replacements; DRSN continued modification work on COMSEC upgrades for DRSN switches; OSS continued standardization and integration of OSS sub-elements; DSCS sustained the DSCS constellation along with doing modem and terminal certifications; SATCOM continued specification development and physically transitioned the Joint C4I Decision Support Center to a new location; PNVC continued with system engineering support; while Assured SATCOM in Single Theater (ASSIST) released the RFI and obtained an ADM for MDD Decision. The DISN Tech Refresh completed 24 of 30 DATMS replacements plus one site upgrade; 4 multifunction soft switch upgrades and replaced 20 EOL COMSEC devices.","FY12 planned accomplishments: Continue to sustain the global DISN, with transport removing 40 DATMS nodes and transitioning 1200 DATS circuits; JWICS transition of 60 more nodes from ATM to IP, updating VTC capability and completion of node optimizations; Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (EPC/SECN) complete SECN site install and 3 switch replacements; DRSN complete COMSEC upgrade development for DRSN switches and develops the Engineering Change Proposal for the Dual Narrowband Interface card (NBIC) for DRSN switch; OSS continued standardization and integration of OSS sub-elements; continued sustainment of the DSCS constellation and modem and terminal certifications; and continued PNVC system engineering support.

The contracts supporting the DISN are primarily firm, fixed price (FFP), and/or indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) commodity-based acquisitions.  The services-based portions of these contracts are mainly Time and Material (T&M), with T&M being deemed appropriate for the risk/uncertainty associated with the mission schedules and execution locations. For those that do execute task orders that are Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), their dollars values do not exceed the $20M policy threshold that recommends/mandates the application of EVM.  Specific tailored oversight is applied to each contractual effort as appropriate.  The DISN PM exercises cost, schedule and performance (CSP) oversight using EVM-like techniques.  A weekly project status, accomplishments, and review of the issues provide constant oversight of short and mid-term schedule activities.  In addition, monthly reviews of actual versus planned spending are accomplished for Time and Material (T&M) Task Orders using an automated collection tool that flags discrepancies from expected cost and schedule objectives.  Major issues are raised to the PM and DISA Senior Leadership.  Quarterly reviews by the DISA Corporate Board covers the status of programs and projects, utilizing operational and performance metrics to provide an overall scorecard of the program's CSP progress, as well as, ensure progress of other contributing programs is achieved.

IPPS-A will be a web-based tool, available 24 hours a day, accessible to the primary beneficiaries of the Soldiers, HR professionals, Combatant Commanders, personnel and pay managers, and other authorized users throughout the Army.  IPPS-A addresses major deficiencies in the delivery of military personnel and pay services and also provides internal controls and audit procedures that prevent erroneous payments and loss of funds.  IPPS-A will support the Warfighter in the core mission of conducting operations; to promote and maintain effective military personnel management; and to ensure that accurate and timely military personnel data, including delivery of benefits, are available at all levels of management and oversight.  To resolve the most critical problems, the program will have to integrate Active Duty, National Guard and Reserve databases; integrate personnel and pay functionality; streamline and improve automated support to the mobilization and deployment processes; and implement standard data that reflect the core requirements of the COCOMs, the Department of the Army, OSD and other Federal agencies.IPPS-A will be developed in two Increments with multiple releases.  Increment I will provide a multi-component Trusted Database with single record for all Army Soldiers.  Fielding of Increment I will lay the foundation for the authoritative database in Increment II and will allow for development of Increment II functionalities.  Increment I will build out the infrastructure to provide Increment II with the ability to support all three Army components with accurate and timely data needed to track the movement of Active, Reserve, and National Guard personnel from location to location in support of operational requirements.  Increment II will be able to link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies.  IPPS-A will account for status changes between Active, Reserve, and National Guard components to ensure accurate service time minimizing impact on individual pay, credit for service, and other benefits as well as enable disciplined human resource management.","The Army currently relies on approximately 60 separate legacy systems to provide personnel and pay management for all Components (Active, Guard and Reserve) that vary greatly in modernity, maintainability and functionality.  These systems were designed at different times, reside on different hardware platforms, use a variety of in-house and commercial software and vary widely in their functionality.  They are based on Component-unique business practices that manage Component-unique data for the Active, Guard and Reserve Components.  Some interfaces have been operating for decades on what is now considered obsolete hardware.  These legacy system deficiencies result in numerous processing errors, manual workarounds and increasing processing costs.  The difficulty in integrating the Army's Component-unique data elements into meaningful information presents problems monitoring deployments, responding to needs of family members and implementing personnel and pay policies. The Army's integrated personnel and pay system must provide all Army Components the capability to effectively manage their members across the full operational spectrum during peacetime, war, through mobilization and demobilization, capturing timely and accurate data throughout.  The Army personnel and pay system shall provide the same functionality at all activities and locations responsible for personnel and/or pay processing.  Key functional requirements for this program, articulated in the IPPS-A Capability Development Document approved by the Army G-3 on July 28, 2010, are summarized as follows: Commanders of all units shall have the ability to access personnel information. The system shall support the full range of personnel life cycle activities.  The Army personnel and pay system shall have the ability to generate standard and ad hoc reports.

GCCS-J is a suite of mission applications/systems that provide critical joint warfighting C2 capabilities by presenting an integrated, near real-time picture of the battle space for planning and execution of joint military and multinational operations. GCCS-J is the Joint C2 System of Record currently consisting of two primary baselines: the Joint Operations Planning & Execution System (JOPES), and GCCS-J Global, which contains Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3), Situational Awareness/Common Operating Picture (COP) capabilities, and supporting infrastructure.  The Status of Forces & Training System (SORTS) transferred programmatic responsibility from GCCS-J to OSD P&R at the end of FY11. The GCCS-J program at-large is responsible for sustaining current operational baselines, modernizating key capability areas and ensuring synchronization across the Family of Systems (FOS). GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. Additionally, through the continued evolution of the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS), the Services are also utilizing components of the GCCS-J infrastructure to build their Service unique variants thus reducing the number of unique components. JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter an interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate. The Joint C2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns to the Department of Defense Information Enterprise Architecture (DoD IEA). It describes architectural concepts, technical constructs, and contains reference information related to the physical, software, information assurance, and data, standards applicable to joint C2 capabilities integration and interoperability. It is designated an authoritative source of information and technical direction for the joint C2 capability area to enable capability investment and modernization planning in support of Department objectives and minimize integration risks as capabilities are developed and deployed.","The Joint Warfighter has requirements for effective, reliable, secure, agile, national, and operational command and control and information sharing capabilities and services that adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.  GCCS-J provides the Joint Warfighter with secure, interoperable, and responsive operational decision-support data, crisis action planning, contingency planning, modeling & simulation (M&S) capability, data visualization and command and control (C2).  The development, integration, and testing of applications and software provides synchronized products and core infrastructure components across the family of systems (FoS), external applications and critical interfaces.

GDSS offers capability for C2 elements to accomplish continuous collaborative planning to task or redirect airborne MAF aircraft while coordinating associated mission, aircrew, and logistics requirements changes through the appropriate Civil Aviation Authority, MAF, Combat Air Forces (CAF), and Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) C2 fixed and mobile elements. GDSS provides a critical part of the capability towards meeting the MAF goal of near-real-time 100% total asset visibility and in-transit visibility. As part of regular technology refresh, GDSS will improve its dynamic mission replanning using cognitive rescheduling technology permitting resource manipulation in near real-time. The technology refresh will also improve global aircrew management giving an automated capability within GDSS to improve its ability to track, task, manage, and report aircrew assignments; and improve global aircrew scheduling allowing GDSS to integrate crew scheduling with a unified sight view of aircraft resource status and availability and rapid mediation of impacts of changes to crew or mission. Currently, there are 19,000 active user accounts from 122 major sites world-wide. GDSS user demographics include aircrew, airfield managers, C2 controllers, flight managers, intelligence, maintenance, mission planners, stage managers, transportation managers, and weather. GDSS directly draws and/or pushes data to the following systems: Advanced Computer Flight Planning System, Global Command and Control System, Air Force Weather Agency System, Global Transportation Network, Virtual Threat Assessor, Single Mobility System, Table Managed Distribution System, AF aircraft maintenance system (GO81), Aviation Resource Management System, Headquarters Air Mobility Command Functional Manager Capabilities and Requirements System, and Global Combat Support System.","GDSS closes the following MAF Mission Critical Gaps:  Synchronize mobility operations across multiple theaters, achieve shared awareness and understanding, dynamically adjust for changes, and collaborate across warfighting domains to ensure shared awareness and shared understanding of plan.  GDSS provides users at all echelons interoperable, shared access to multi-domain (e.g. USTRANSCOM, AF, Joint, coalition, civil) information sources to enable global situational awareness, planning, execution, and assessment activities in support of joint, allied, and coalition operations.  The fusing of information from multiple sources in a networked environment enables commanders and decision makers to attain improved global situational awareness to support dynamic C2 of MAF forces.  GDSS is a Mission Assurance Category I (MAC I) System.  GDSS handles information that is determined to be vital to the operational readiness and mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces in terms of both content and timeliness.  The consequences of loss of integrity or availability of a MAC I system are unacceptable and could include the immediate and sustained loss of mission effectiveness.  MAC I systems require the most stringent protection measures.","- Attained Full Operating Capability with fielding GDSS version 2.3.0-updated functional capability, completed transition of legacy interfaces, and powered down all Legacy GDSS equipment- Fielded GDSS version 2.3.1 addressing functional user issues, ensured Standard Desktop Compliance 3.x compatibility, and upgraded security- Developed and fielded GDSS NIPRNet version 2.3.2 as a technology refresh to utilize 64-bit capability and upgraded storage area network- Developed GDSS version 2.3.3 with Common Access Card/Public Key Infrastructure (CAC/PKI) integration and Transportation Tracking and Accounting Number initiatives- Developed and fielded two GDSS Exercise Management Console versions- Developed and fielded Aviation Operations Risk Management (AvORM) version 2.3- Initiated GDSS technology refresh with Dynamic Mission Replanning (DMR), Global Aircrew Management (GAM), and Global Aircrew Scheduling (GAS).","- Complete fielding GDS SIPRNet version 2.3.2 delivering technology refresh utilizing 64-bit & upgraded storage area network- Field GDSS version 2.3.3 delivering CAC/PKI integration & implement transportation tracking and accounting number initiative- Develop and field GDSS version 2.3.4 addressing 30 user-requested functionality fixes- Develop and field GDSS version 3.0 addressing downward-directed requirements, incorporating technology updates, and first phase toward web-based-only capability- Develop GDSS version 3.0.1 phase 2 web-based capability and begin development of version 3.0.2 addressing external interface changes, software obsolescence and mandated security updates. - Upgrade two enclave sites to provide SIPRNet replication capability- Initiate development of replacement cross domain solution. - Develop and field three AvORM versions to provide analysis of changing flight scheduling information/sleep times and durations to analyze impact on mission changes and optimize mission effectiveness- Develop and begin transition of selected GAM functions to internet applications- Develop DMR functionality and complete initial architecture and external/ internal engineering for single site integration- Begin modifying GAS internal systems and Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS) and initiate an enterprise version of GAS by creating an initial architecture and defining internal and external engineering changes.  - Develop and field three major GDSS version updates addressing last two web-based capabilities phases while including downward-directed modifications (external interface changes to ensure compliance with evolving security requirements and optimize data flow, address software obsolescence issues, and be compliant with mandated security updates)- Continue development of cross domain replacement solution. - Validate, define, and mitigate user requirements in AvORM and field version 3.0. - Field operational prototypes for DMR and GAM to a limited user base.

007-000001184,7,Department of Defense,57,Department of the Air Force,"Mission Planning Systems (MPS) is a collection of individual programs that provide automated flight and weapons delivery planning.  Collectively, they have been designated as a  Major Automated Information System (MAIS) that must meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for a MAIS acquisition program.  The overarching MPS acquisition strategy is based upon an incremental approach where multiple projects are developed concurrently, but all are at different stages within the development timeline.  Although not a joint program, MPS is the DoD system of record providing mission planning capabilities for the Air Force, Army and Navy and other DoD agencies.  MPS includes the Unix-MPS, the Portable Flight Planning Software or PFPS, and the Joint Mission Planning System or JMPS.  The objective of the MPS programs is to migrate legacy systems to a seamless, collaborative, single multi-service PC-based system operating in a net-centric environment.  FY13 RDT&E funding support initial migration to JMPS as well as Modernization follow-on releases for platforms that have initially fielded a JMPS MPE.  Increment IV and Modernization programs represent a strategy to continually meet new operational flight program capability as dictated by the aircraft.  FY13 Procurement funding supports the continued refresh of MPS hardware for the JMPS Increment IV and Modernization Program.  It also continues to fund production systems for the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS).  FY13 O&M funding primarily support software maintenance requirements for JMPS software maintenance activities on platforms where platform specific changes are integrated into RDT&E releases for fielding to include seven platforms.FY13 O&M dollars also funds unit-level support to include consumables, system support representatives that provide system administration for operational units, and depot-level technical support for all mission planning systems.The mission planning products produced by this investment, to include fight plans and the mission planning data load on a cartridge type device, are critical to the warfighter and the execution of airpower as directed by the national command authorities.

However, Part II, Section C (Cost and Schedule Performance) of this report reflects a tailored EVM process that has been implemented for Teleport at the program level. Given that no prime contractor for the Teleport Program is contemplated, the TPO has developed budget and schedule baselines for those program elements that will be accomplished by DISA and for those that have been delegated to other DOD organizations. These baselines are structured around a program Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and provide a description of the work packages to be accomplished, an associated schedule with milestones, and the required funding. Cost and schedule performance will be monitored for those elements via tailored reporting from the Teleport Program Office (TPO) and the other implementing DOD organizations.  The TPO makes use of existing performance management and metrics mechanisms currently in-place to monitor performance on existing contract vehicles used to implement Teleport.  If any new contracts are awarded specifically for Teleport, TPO will incorporate those contractor performance management provisions that are appropriate for the contract size and type.  The use of EVMS has helped the TPO meet program cost, schedule, and performance objectives.",4,Program is being monitored,6.0,2011-06-01

The primary benefits of JBC-P are reduced fratricide and enhanced Mission Command down to the dismounted soldier, providing more effective operations.  The primary beneficiary is the warfighter.Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) is a foundation for achieving information interoperability between joint warfighting elements on current and future battlefields.  As the follow on program to Force XXI Battle Command Brigade & Below (FBCB2) technology, it will be the principal command and control system for the Army and Marine Corps at the brigade and below level, providing users access to the tactical information necessary to achieve information dominance over the enemy.  It consists of computer hardware and software integrated into tactical vehicles, aircraft, and provided to dismounted forces.  JBC-P uses a product line approach to software development to save cost and promote a common architecture.  Components include a core software module that provides common functionality required of all platforms and tailored software modules with unique capabilities for dismounted, vehicle, logistic, aviation, and command post elements.  JBC-P software is designed for use over the Blue Force Tracking II transceiver and associated satellite networks, as well as ground-based networks.  Other key enhancements include a redesigned, intuitive user interface and faster mapping software to quickly process and display critical graphics.  It will be the primary provider and user of digital battle command and situational awareness across the spectrum of operations and will allow warfighters to more effectively and consistently communicate critical information over networks that connect the most distant and remote locations.JBC-P software is designed to run on existing FBCB2 systems as well as new hardware items, reducing the army''s investment in new hardware.  In addition to utilizing the FBCB2 systems, JBC-P provides new hardware capabilities including ruggedized remoteable vehicle computers (tablets), dismounted devices for use with tablets, one way beacons, and ancillary equipment (e.g., Mission Data Loader, Disc Duplicator, cables, installation kits, etc.).","Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P) provides true Joint Force Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) capability at the platform level and enables mission accomplishment across the entire spectrum of Joint military operations.

BCS-F provides 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year Command and Control (C2) mission support within the United States and Canada to include Alaska, Hawaii, US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  Its five operational locations within the US and Canada execute surveillance, identification, data link operations, weapons control, and air battle management within their respective areas of operation.  BCS-F supports other DoD and Governmental Agencies in support of various Homeland Security missions and civil relief operations.  It conducts other Special Security Event missions (Super Bowl, Presidential Inaugurations, and other requirements) and is tasked with the protection of the President and Vice-President of the US.  BCS-F conducts operations and provides tactical control for the defense of the National Capital Region mission.  The delivered capabilities of BCS-F fill existing and emerging capability and performance gaps in command and control missions, Homeland and theater air defense, civil relief, airspace management, data link management, air surveillance, weapons control, and aircraft identification.  Additionally, BCS-F enabled the cost-saving closure of one of three CONUS Air Defense Sectors, increased radar input capacity and area of coverage, and increased flight plan processing capacity.  The upgrade of hardware and software components significantly increased system operational availability and stopped sustainment shortfalls created by diminishing resources. Major budget year goals will be the fielding of a Machine-to-machine interface with the Theater Battle Management Core System via IP v6 and RSS feeds enabling automated data integration of Air Tasking Order and Airspace Control Order data, nearly eliminating operator tasks and significantly reducing the likelihood of human error.

I3MP employs a synchronized effort to modernize the Army's information networks, outside cable plants, telephone switching systems, campus area networks and long haul gateway for Army installations in Europe/Pacific/CONUS. I3MP supports the deployed commander by upgrading the capacity and reliability of the infrastructure enabling access to stay behind forces and support agencies. I3MP, in accordance with the Department of the Army's approved Installation Sequence Lists and thru the use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf products and contract installers, replaces the antiquated, costly, unsupportable and maintenance intensive legacy systems with an integrated information system that is state-of-the-art, secure, interoperable and capable of passing voice/data/video traffic. I3MP also provides local distribution capability for information exchange for business systems and collaboration as well as achieving funding efficiencies by reducing duplication, minimizing impact on the receiving installation and by engineering a total site solution. These base infrastructures are capable of supporting Defense Reform Initiatives, the Global Information Grid-Bandwidth Expansion, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and the Unified Capabilities (UC) initiative. This infrastructure is critical for reach back and power projection of the digital division and employment of advanced technology for an agile combat force. I3MP improves the overall quality of the service of the information infrastructure. The restructure of PM I3MP and incorporation of management of the Army Enterprise affords the Army the opportunity to provide enterprise-level oversight and management of its entire information infrastructure under one program/one Project Manager (PM). The addition of the enterprise management provides the Army with capabilities and adaptive processes that support network-centric, secure access to knowledge, systems and services throughout the Army environment. PM I3MP capabilities in support of the continued implementation of VoIP and a stepping stone to UC will significantly impact the warfighter''s ability to obtain secure access to critical information.","This investment takes the Army closer to the Unified Communications (UC) and eventually move all communications to everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP) IAW latest guidance from the Army CIO/G-6 and NETCOM.  Voice communications are vital to the warfighter.  Funding decrements to I3MP Annual Planned work will impair I3MP''s ability to deliver voice communications infrastructure and provide a transition to the required future EoIP technology.  As a first step to UC and EoIP, the Army and the DoD are in the midst of transitioning voice communications from the legacy Time Division Multiplex (TDM) technology to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).  This transition is not optional; it is necessary because the vendor community is phasing out support for TDM, and TDM equipment is expiring.  Any decrement to funding will lengthen the time it will take for the transition to VoIP.  Individual locations will receive VoIP later than planned, and the overall program will be extended.  A timeline extension could result in failure or obsolescence of existing legacy TDM equipment before VoIP could be implemented.  Also, as these systems age, the maintenance costs increase, and supportability decreases.  This leads to costly, unpredictable repairs.  In addition, extending the timeline increases overall cost.  The more time I3MP takes to build out the Installation Information Infrastructure, the more refresh cycles are needed to keep the already fielded equipment up to date.  To avoid impact to the Warfighters and their ability to communicate, these I3MP efforts need to be fully funded.  A decrement in Current Year funding would result in limited VoIP work at Forts Bragg, Knox, Lewis, Aberdeen Proving Gouund, Grafenwohr, Kaiserslautern, Schoffield Barracks, and decrements in Base Year and Base Year +1 funding would result in limited UC foundational efforts at Forts Hill, Benning, Stewart, Irwin, Huachuca, and Eustis.","* Replaced the antiquated, costly, unsupportable and maintenance intensive legacy systems with an integrated information system that is state-of-the-art, secure, interoperable and capable of passing voice/data/video traffic.* Completed engineering efforts: -Ft Bliss, TX- Phase 10 (Hospital)-Ft Huachuca, AZ(BOB II)-Ft Leavenworth, KS-Ft Campbell, KY-Ft.

The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS), within which Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) computing and storage capabilities will reside in current and future iterations. CANES will provide complete infrastructure, inclusive of hardware, software, processing, storage, and end user devices for Unclassified-SCI, for all basic network services (email, web, chat, collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants, submarines, Maritime Operations Centers, and Aircraft. Approximately 36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Information Operations, Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Specific programs, such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N), Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M), Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS), and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field, host, and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires ADNS to field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs. FY 2013 will fund procurement, integration, ship designs, and installation.Continue platform set 3 & 4 baseline development. Perform Developmental Testing (DT) and Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) on unit level platform in support of Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in 4Q. Begin DT on force level baseline. All will benefit the mission by driving significant reductions: systems consolidation, virtualization, commonality, enhanced usability and automation of systems management, administration, troubleshooting to support interoperability amoung tactical/non-tactical elements across the Global Information Grid.","The CANES program''s consolidated, integrated approach will address architecture, configuration management, training, and logistics issues, while rapidly and inexpensively transitioning new Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)/Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) technologies.  CANES will retain the current core Navy network capabilities while providing increased performance and improved technical adaptability to Navy afloat LANs.  Capability gaps to be addressed by CANES include: system interoperability, collaboration, information access, cross domain security, information exchange, and system responsiveness. A single CANES installation replaces 4 networks and more than 36 server based applications or systems.  CANES is designed with embedded Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense capabilities.  Systems and network management capabilities provide automated Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVA), intrusion detection, detection of rogue access, and the ability to command and control the network.  CANES delivers authoritative Defense in Depth for all networks/hosted applications and provides Computer Network Defense/Information Operations Condition to combat internal and external threats.","-Achieved Milestone B (MS B), which approves entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.

007-000003538,7,Department of Defense,17,Department of the Navy,"Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is an enterprise network which will provide secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and represents the continuous evolution of information technology at the Department of Navy. NGEN forms the foundation for the DON''s future Naval Network Environment that will be interoperable with and leverage other Department of Defense (DoD) provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services.  The NGEN program has been established to provide net-centric capability that replaces and improves the enterprise IT services that the previous Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) provided (expired September 2010).  The Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC) was awarded to the NMCI Incumbent in July 2010 to support the transition from NMCI to NGEN.  NGEN Block 1 will be fielded in increments using a spiral development process.  Each spiral or increment will incorporate additional scope, quantities, capability and security as operational and fiscal constraints permit.  Since October 2010, CoSC has provided continued NMCI 2010 capability for the largest DoD centrally managed IT network, supporting approximately 382,000 seats representing over 700,000 users across the globe and providing comprehensive, end-to-end information services through a common computing and communication environment.  Transition to NGEN begins in FY13 as Program Management Office (PMO) plans to award segmentation contracts for Transport Services (i.e. LAN/BAN) and Enterprise Services (seat and non-seat services).  Additionally, NGEN will procure End User Hardware as a service and purchase software licenses via DoD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI).  NGEN PMO has entered Gate 5, with Gate 6 planned for 4th Qtr FY12 prior to Milestone (M/S) C, 1st Qtr FY13.  NGEN is on track to release the Request for Proposal (RFP) for Transport Services contract in early 2012 and anticipates contract award by 1st Quarter (Qtr) FY13.  The CoSC transition contract ends in April 2014.","NGEN, as the successor to the NMCI, has been developed to provide increased Navy command and control through ownership of the network and decrease costs through competition of various segments of the operation instead of a single service contract.","FY2011 Other Procurement, Navy (OPN) funds procured a Government Purpose Rights (GPR) license for the Technical Data Processes and Procedures (TDPP) from Hewlett Packard/Enterprise Services (HP/ES).  Government Purpose Rights (GPR) permits full use and transference of information for development of the segmentation contracts that comprise the future Naval Enterprise Network.  In accordance with the CoSC Technical Refresh Plan (TRP), FY11 OPN funding also provided for the Technical Refresh (TR) of fielded equipment and components required to support the network.  FY2011 Operations & Maintenance, Navy (OMN) funding financed operations, including Transport and Enterprise Services, End User Services fees, Hardware Usage fees, and End User Device TR under the CoSC that was awarded July 2010.","FY12 funding will continue to finance the TR of fielded equipment and components required to support the network, in accordance with the CoSC TRP.  Additionally, FY12 funding will continue financing operations, including Transport and Enterprise Services, End User Services fees, Hardware Usage fees, End User Device TR under CoSC, and procurement of software licenses via DoD ESI.  The Navy will use FY13 funding to complete the scheduled Technical Refresh (TR) of network hardware to ensure compliance with contractual requirements to maintain the network in compliance with industry standards for best practices.  Additionally, in FY13 the Navy will award contracts to transition from the CoSC to NGEN.  These contracts provide operation and maintenance of the transport segment consisting of cable plants, servers, routers, switches and the myriad of network devices necessary to provide the NGEN capabilities.

The system represents the AF commitment to modernizing business practices and providing enhanced support for today''s service members and their families. AF-IPPS will align with Department of Defense (DoD) data standards for personnel, pay, and accounting, including the Common Human Resource Information Standards (CHRIS) and the Enterprise Information Web (EIW) effort, which will ensure compliance with the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).Current AF personnel and pay operations are implemented in separate domains and systems, each with independent business processes, technical solutions, and information technology (IT). The lack of an integrated system and antiquated technology contribute to thousands of personnel and pay errors and delays in customer support that drives total cost of ownership higher across system operations. AF-IPPS eliminates the current systems'' problems by delivering an integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that provides accurate and timely personnel and pay information for AF operations and superior customer service for the Airman. AF-IPPS will ensure that Air Force personnel and pay fully support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) FY17 auditability requirements.The AF-IPPS acquisition strategy is a two increment approach, with multiple, discrete, and severable capability releases delivered every 18-24 months. For Increment 1, the government will conduct a full and open competitive (best value) source selection with a single contract award for blueprinting, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation, integration with the government hosting environment, testing, delivery, and sustainment. Increment 2 will be a separate acquisition effort focused on the sustainment of the system.","*Reduce current annual payroll errors by 75%.  Each year AF & DFAS have to resolve 85,000 pay cases for AF military members - most of which require human intervention and often result in incorrect payments.  AF-IPPS will eliminate today's stovepipe between personnel and pay, dramatically lowering the number of pay cases, and substantially improving customer service for accurate and timely pay. *Reduce current annual system operating costs by 30%.  Legacy personnel and pay computer systems are heavily customized and expensive to operate.  A modern integrated platform serving both personnel and pay will require less maintenance, and reduce overhead by consolidating the operating environments.*Enable AF FY17 compliance with Congressional mandate for financial auditing.  Currently, DoD financial systems (and feeder systems) do not fully comply with the rigorous financial auditing expected for proper accounting.  Legacy personnel and pay systems contribute to this problem.  Congress has directed DoD to solve this by 2017 - AF-IPPS will use the latest commercial and governmental auditing tracking to enable full compliance.*Provide integrated, timely human resource (HR) data for Combatant Commanders.

007-000006046,7,Department of Defense,17,Department of the Navy,"Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) is the Maritime implementation of the GCCS Family of Systems.  It provides Maritime Commanders at all echelons of command with a single, integrated, scalable Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system that fuses, correlates, filters, maintains and displays location and attribute information on friendly, hostile and neutral land, sea and air forces.  It integrates this data with available intelligence and environmental information to support command decision-making.  The system operates in near real-time and constantly updates unit positions and other situational awareness data.  GCCS-M records data in appropriate databases and maintains a history of changes to those records.  The user can use the data to construct relevant tactical pictures using maps, charts, topography overlays, oceanographic overlays, meteorological overlays, imagery data and all-source intelligence information coordinated into a Common Operational Picture (COP) that can be shared locally and with other sites.  Navy Commanders can review and evaluate the general tactical situation, plan actions and operations, direct forces, synchronize tactical movements and integrate force maneuver with firepower.  The system operates in a variety of environments and supports joint, coalition and allied forces.OASD (NII) formed a family of command and control systems, the goals being to increase general oversight, reduce overlap, and improve the relative systems from the Joint perspective, especially in the area of interoperability.  GCCS-M is the Maritime component of the GCCS FoS and is designated as a Mission Critical, Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAC - Major Automated Information System (MAIS), National Security System (NSS).  ASN(RDA) is the Milestone Decision Authority.  The Command and Control Program Office (Program Manager, Warfare (PMW) 150) functions as the acquisition program manager under PEO C4I.Benefits:* Increased situational awareness, greater integration with hardware, and increased network security.* Addresses the unique requirements of Unit Level, Group Level and Force Level users.* Upgrade required to address operating system end of life issues.* Primary beneficiaries include Navy Commanders and Watchstanders, both afloat and ashore. Major Dependency: Enterprise Hardware.","GCCS-M is required to maintain situational awareness in the Navy. GCCS-M automates much of the tactical processes that were previously done manually.  The speed by which plans can now be passed via GCCS-M using geometric overlays dramatically slashes tactical collaboration time among warfare commanders. Using GCCS-M, warfighters can build circular range rings to represent enemy weapon envelopes, reference points with times for rendezvous of allied forces or expected enemy positions, and designate search areas and surveillance coverage.  Warfighters receive a remote tactical plan and display it directly onto a local tactical display without having to redraw or reenter the data.  Rapid collaboration and tactical innovation are also key benefits of GCCS-M.  For example, instead of manually plotting a navigation route, erasing and recomputing speed vs. time and distance requirements, operators can use GCCS-M software to point and click latitude and longitude positions, enter variables for desired speed or time, and allow the computer processor to compute the solution, reducing what could normally take 2-4 hours of work into less than 10 minutes of data entry.  Additionally, these overlays, such as a ship's navigation track, can be rapidly transmitted internally and externally, and, when received, modified and automatically redrawn from other displays without having to re-enter the data.The sharing of information is the most critical benefit. GCCS-M provides the means by which tactical afloat commanders share operations and intelligence information across the battlespace.  GCCS-M, built to the joint standard, is interoperable with joint community command and control capabilities and allows seamless two-way exchange of continuously updating information on U.S., allies and hostile forces across the joint battlespace.  This force disposition information is simultaneously available for tactical and operational commanders, Unified and Specified Commanders, and National decision-makers.","Prior Year Accomplishments, FY11:* In Nov 2010, GCCS-M Inc 2 received Patrol Coastal COTF-approved test report with Operationally Effective/Suitable (OE/OS) determination.

There are currently five Air Force platforms without a JMPS migration path.  The B-2 and B-52 won''t migrate due to a reduction in program funding and will stay on legacy Unix-MPS for the foreseeable future.  The MQ-1/9 will remain on the Portable Flight Planning Software legacy system indefinitely.  The U-2 will not migrate to JMPS due to the sunset rule and will remain on legacy Unix-MPS until retired.This initiative has no RDTEAF requirements or funding associated with it in FY13.  FY13 Procurement funding supports the continued refresh of MPS hardware for legacy programs and the MPS Increment I/II/III Program.  FY13 O&M funding primarily support software maintenance requirements for legacy systems on five platforms.  Funding supports JMPS software maintenance activities on six Increment I/II/III platforms.  FY13 O&M dollars also funds unit-level support to include consumables, system support representatives that provide system administration for operational units, and depot-level technical support for all mission planning systems.The mission planning products produced by this investment, to include fight plans and the mission planning data load on a cartridge type device, are critical to the warfighter and the execution of airpower as directed by the national command authorities.  While there isn''t a link between this investment and other IT investments, there is a link between this investment and other Air Force aircraft programs that require mission planning capability to enable the capability in their operational flight software.","Currently, MPS doesn''t have a performance gap that MPS Inc I-III requirements will fill.

007-000006298,7,Department of Defense,21,Department of the Army,"The Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) is a System (combination of hardware and software solution with a user interface). LMP delivers an enterprise system that builds, sustains, and generates warfighting capabilities using one of the largest, fully-integrated supply chain and maintenance, repair, and overhaul solutions in the world. LMP delivers a fully integrated suite of software and business processes, providing streamlined data on maintenance, repair, and overhaul, planning, finance, acquisition, weapon systems supplies, spare parts, services, and materiel. It is the Army''s core logistics information technology (IT) initiative that replaced the two largest National-level logistics systems: the inventory management Commodity Command Standard System (CCSS), and the depot and arsenal operations Standard Depot System (SDS). The primary beneficiaries of the LMP solution are the Army Materiel Command (AMC) depots and arsenals that support the warfighter. LMP meets the Army''s IT logistics vision of a long-overdue transformation from legacy National applications to a modernized logistics enterprise solution across AMC to arsenals, depots, and other non-depot maintenance activities at the National level. LMP support is critical to the Army achieving an integrated enterprise solution that enables materiel readiness and provides asset management and accountability, architecture and acquisition compliancy, and financial transparency. LMP manages approximately 2 million transactions daily, approximately $22 billion in inventory on more than 70 Department of Defense (DoD) systems to include interfaces with Army''s other Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems currently under development - Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army), and General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS). LMP was fielded to all remaining commands, depots, arsenals and related sites in October 2010 and is currently used by approximately 25,000 users at more than 50 Army and DoD Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations, including the Army''s Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC), Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) LCMC, TACOM LCMC, Joint Munitions and Lethality (JM&L),  Army Sustainment Command (ASC), and all depots and arsenals in the Industrial Operations Activity Group, as well as the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS).","Before LMP, the Army used 30-year-old systems to manage its logistics supply of critical equipment and repair parts. These systems created a complex web of legacy software solutions that were slow and difficult to maintain, and could not meet the Army''s expanding needs.  The stove-piped systems were not integrated, resulting in additional effort to manually transfer data between systems. LMP was developed to address these issues by transforming the language into an interoperable enterprise standard language common to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. LMP replaced eight instances of Commodity Command Standard System (CCSS) and 42 instances of Standard Depot System (SDS), two of the Army's largest legacy systems. This investment supports LMP's mission to sustain, monitor, measure, and improve the modernized National-Level logistics support solution. It also supports providing capability required but not inherent in LMP today to support closing identified performance gaps such as:-Providing enhancements to maintain compliance (Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP))-Achieving auditable financials by 2017 (National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY10) -Providing enhanced and automated capabilities (Expanded Industrial Base (EIB), Enterprise Ammunition (AMMO)) -Realizing the Army's strategic vision as documented in: 1) Dept of the Army (DA) Business Systems Information Technology (BSIT) Strategy 2011;

Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds are used to perform all the non-recurring GPS Surface Ship, Submarine and Aircraft Development, Integration, and Testing efforts.  As stated in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6130.01D, 2007 Master Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Plan (MPNTP), GPS is the primary source of Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) information for the Department of Defense (DoD).  In accordance with Chief of Naval Operations Instructions (OPNAVINST) 9420.1B GPS Precise Positioning Service (PPS) systems shall be used for all combat, combat support, and combat service support operations and training to provide assured access to accurate position and performance under intentional and unintentional interference. This direction is in keeping with the National Security/Presidential Directive (NSPD)-39 of 15 December 2004 and current solutions are well-supported by numerous studies and analyses that include Defense Science Board Task Force reports, October 2005, the DoD''s GPS III System Architecture/Requirements Definition (SA/RD) of January 2003, and various DoD and Navy requirements documents.  The Naval Research Advisory Committee (NRAC) GPS Vulnerability Study Panel assessed the Navy''s GPS Vulnerabilities and recommended specific actions to resolve serious issues to ensure the continued availability of GPS information in a high risk hostile jamming environment. As a result, the Navy Enhanced GPS User Equipment Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was drafted to address operational requirements. The requirements were validated and the ORD was approved on June 7, 2000. With this beginning, OSD directed the first phase of the Navy''s overall GPS Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) upgrade program with RDT&E leading to initial procurements of GPS anti-jam (AJ) antennas beginning in 2001 for aircraft and 2002 for ships.

These products are components of JTRS radios and support net-centric operational warfare at sea, in the air, and on the ground.  As such, these products will benefit the mission by continuing to reduce our reliance on single purpose combat radio nets and move toward multipurpose-multi-user networks and create netted communities to command, control and coordinate activities across the joint operational battlespace.JTRS NED directly benefits Joint Warfighters, who require that the sensing communications node on the battlefield is able to pass target data directly to the ordnance/reconnaissance node in a way that is transparent, Internet Protocol (IP) -based, and minimizes the Department of Defense (DoD) communications gap by promoting commonality, interoperability, and cost savings through maximization of software code porting and reuse.","This investment closes the mission delivery gap for interoperable tactical radio communications systems in support of Joint military operations.  Existing tactical radio systems were designed with mutually exclusive architectures to perform specific tasks; generally cannot interoperate except with like radios operating a single waveform on a single frequency band; are not capable of simultaneous voice, video, and data operations; and lack the ability to conduct complex network management and facilitate inter-Service interoperability.  NED helps close this gap by delivering, maintaining, and upgrading portable, interoperable, mobile ad hoc networking waveforms and network enterprise services for tactical radios.

Because most of the identified contracts do not meet Federal Acquisition Regulation dollar thresholds for requiring use of formal, validated EVM systems, to facilitate improved program and project management NCES implements/tracks a tailored subset of earned value concepts that fit within ANSI/EIA-748 Standard through Post-award Contract Reviews (PCRs) and monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs). This process uses schedule variance and performance reporting to validate program dollars. The program office analyzes performance and schedule variance reports on a monthly basis throughout the lifecycle. All CPRs reflect the total contract value and are validated against schedule/deliverable baselines and adjustments are made as required.All contracts follow current DoD Acquisition Policy and DoD EVM Policy, whereas EVM is discouraged on firm-fixed price, level of effort, and time and materials efforts, including contracts, subcontracts, intra-government work agreements, and other agreements, regardless of dollar value. If knowledge by both parties requires access to cost/schedule data, the first action is to re-examine the contract type (e.g. fixed price incentive). However, in extraordinary cases where cost/schedule visibility is required and cannot be obtained using the Truth in Negotiation Act, the PM shall obtain a waiver for individual contracts from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). Several NCES capabilities are acquired via firm fixed price contract agreements with MSPs. In these cases, NCES uses performance-based services acquisition practices to obtain commercial capabilities, using negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to define limits of the service being provided by the contract and establish associated performance incentives. The PMO does, however, maximize the use of performance-based contracts and incentives, and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives.

HRSA assures the availability of quality health care to low income, uninsured, isolated, vulnerable and special needs populations. In meeting its mission, HRSA relies on the Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) to assist with improving the performance of HRSA funded programs, sharing data and conducting business in a more efficient manner. The EHBs currently serves more than 40,000 users in managing HRSA grants and projects. EHBs support HRSA with program administration, grants administration and monitoring, management reporting, and performance measurement and analysis. The investment serves HRSA's goal to integrate existing grant support systems into one transparent enterprise-wide system. In conjunction with GRANTS.GOV, this system has streamlined the application and administration process and has enabled applicants, grantee organizations and HRSA to communicate and conduct activities electronically. It allows HRSA to operate in a paperless fashion, with improved business efficiency, and in compliance with mandated Agency-wide and Federal policies, procedures and legislation. The system provides all potential grantees a means to access competitive funding opportunities published as a part of the annual HRSA Preview and to submit applications electronically. HRSA uses HHS ACF's Center of Excellence (COE) for grant award processing. The system provides Grantees electronic means for completing post-award reporting requirements and aid HRSA program staff with conducting in-depth analysis of program grant allocation, use and effectiveness. The EHBs have allowed for a standardization of many of HRSA's business processes as a result of the consolidation.","HRSA does not have identified performance gaps in support of mission delivery. EHBs provides an e-Government solution to grant lifecycle management, allowing more than 100 grant, loan, and scholarship programs to effectively and efficiently support their citizen customers. A lack of full funding will limit enhancements to the system. These enhancements are necessary to meet Congressional and Executive reporting requirement changes, automate remaining manual processes, improve computing efficiency, update the system to the latest available technology, and simplify processes for users. Failure to fund ongoing maintenance and operations needs will require HRSA to add staff to complete grants management processes via a paper process and limit customer service to grantees in managing their grants.","The EHBs added functionality in two areas: the grant review and awards process, as well as, several areas within the post-award data collection function. In the grant review area, financial investigation capability was added. Financial investigations were handled in separate databases with some manual workflow and paper routing. In the awards area, additional streamlining actions took place to quicken the non-competing continuing grants process. In prior years, grantees needed to reapply for grants every year, even when the project period was 3 to 5 years. These grants, called non-competing continuations, now must simply request continuation, which HRSA evaluates using a simpler review process.  In the post-award area, the investment integrated the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education into the EHBs grant management process.","The EHBs will add functionality in two areas: the grant planning process and performance monitoring, as well as, several areas within the post-award data collection function. All new functionality will adopt the new user interface. Some existing functionality will retrofitted to use the new interface. The current planning process requires 370 days to prepare, announce, review, award, and document grants. The process will be streamlined to reduce the number of days required for this entire process, helping grantees receive awards faster from the time of application.  The EHBs will expand the dashboard capability originally conceived for the Bureau of Primary Healthcare to offer customized dashboard capability for each of HRSA's internal stakeholders: each Bureau and Office, various user roles, as well as Grantees. The post award process will have two major improvements. Some of the Bureau of Health Professions programs will begin collecting data for longitudinal study, requiring a redesign of the EHBs data model. The Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education program will update the entire system to work more efficiently within the EHBs architecture. The HIV/AIDS Bureau will extend their new data elements that track individual patient data to additional grantees. This will further improve the Bureau to enhance program design and delivery.

This investment also directly supports the PMA initiative of Expanded E-government through electronic data transmission and data sharing. It also supports the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, the Federal Upper Limits program, procurement of compendia data, State Plan Amendments, Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic & Treatment program, Drug Data Reporting for Medicaid (DDR) web application and the DCCA Data Center (which hosts DDR and 6 other Medicaid application from another contract), the Medicaid & State Children Health Insurance Program Budget & Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), and Medicaid and grant funding. Additionally, it helps achieve the HHS Strategic goal to 'Improve health care quality, safety, cost, and value' and supports CMS' strategic goal of promoting fiscal integrity. The annual operational analysis indicates this investment continues to provide the expected benefits and fill the gap for which it was designed and continues to be the most cost-effective solution.   The Medicaid Data Systems include the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), as well as data storage (flat files, data warehouse, and data marts). Besides being the core information system for CMCS, MSIS supports much of the Medicaid research and analysis performed by the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service. MSIS, and the accompanying data storage, are also a key resource for other Federal agencies and research projects involving Medicaid.","This investment will close the gap in support of the mission delivery and management support by making extensive changes to the existing MSIS and significant changes to the states' MMIS. To satisfy the new requirements, the MSIS will collect and report on 300-500 additional data elements on a projected monthly collection/reporting process. This will require technical assistance for the states to 1) identify state source systems for new data elements, 2) collaborate with the State CHIP Agency for reporting data to MSIS, 3) ensure that Managed Care plans are sending necessary claims data to states, and 4) ensure and map managed care claims into MSIS.

While providing direct medical care to our patients is key, as the nation's largest research hospital, data collection and analysis for clinical trials is critical to improving the health of the nation.  CRIS is a system of multiple modules from Allscripts and is interfaced with many other applications to support the Clinical Center's mission of healthcare research.  CRIS has interfaces to multiple applications specific to departments such as radiology, nutrition, surgery, laboratory and pharmacy.  This integration provides a central source of data, images and reports for patient care givers and clinical researchers of the NIH intramural program.  With the core mission of the NIH as research, CRIS has enabled the intramural program to pool all patient data into one repository creating efficiencies and allowing researchers to analyze increasingly more complex data and results by protocol or across protocols. CRIS continues to meet goals set through a rigorous management oversight and CPIC process.  Budget requests are vetted through the CC ITAG and CC executive leadership.CRIS is supported through the NIH Clinical Center Data Center infrastructure as part of the overall NIH IT Infrastructure, which includes dependencies on the availability of power, cooling, network, etc.   The integration that allows for a central source for data is dependent on the ancillary, or department specific, systems that feed data into CRIS.","CRIS is the Electronic Health Record for the Intramural Program at the NIH.  The system is used for all ordering, resulting, and clinical documentation for patient and research care for over 350,000 patients, 80,000 of which are currently active. The system provides a mechanism to efficiently care for patients in a safe environment such as ensuring the right medication/test is provided to the right patient at the right time. The patient data from CRIS is fed to the BTRIS system which is the Research Data Repository.  As a research facility with the focus on 1400 research studies active at any one time the integrity of the data is critical to the analysis of the research hypothesis and the outcomes defined in the Protocol.

Previously, grant processes varied widely across agencies and programs, resulting in a complicated, burdensome, and costly methodology to find grants.  Grants.gov, mandated by the 2002 President's Management Agenda and Public Law 106-107, has transformed the federal grants environment by streamlining and standardizing public-facing grant processes, simplifying and improving the process for both grantees and grantors, and eliminating redundancies.Grants.gov provides over one million organizations, a single web site where they can find and apply for over $153 billion worth of grants distributed annually.  Grants.gov empowers smaller agencies with limited resources to improve the reach of their grant programs, and provides larger agencies with the benefit of process standardization, cost savings, and increased visibility.  The program is funded by the 26 Federal grant-making agencies, each providing support commensurate with its size according to a formula approved by the Grants Executive Board (GEB).  In 2010, Grants.gov focused on continuing operations with limited funding and increased usage.   These improvements included a major system hardware upgrade, new reports, improved login security controls and audits, and performance improvements.  In 2011 and 2012, Grants.gov will continue to focus on operations and maintenance, including implementing a disaster recovery capability in keeping with the increased system criticality. Many important enhancements desired by users such as collaborative grant applications are pending approval by the GEB.  Improvements to infrastructure software, submission validation, reports, and submission status tracking will be made as budgets allow.Grants.gov is currently engaged in conducting an analysis of how to incorporate new technologies to continue providing the same level of service at a reduced cost.   Moving to the Cloud would relieve Grants.gov of the costs inherent in maintaining a system, including equipment maintenance, upkeep, and refresh.  The analysis has identified several options within the Cloud Computing environment including repositioning the system partially within the Cloud, while maintaining some of the current environment.   Since the initial transfer and related costs are presently unknown, Grants.gov intends to update the information in the Summary of Spending Table for fiscal year 2016 at that time.","HHS carries out large portions of its mission through grants.  Grants.gov improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the grants process for 26 federal agencies including HHS and its components.  Efficiency is improved by providing a single, simple, Web-based mechanism for agencies to post grant opportunities, and by providing common forms and a common system for receiving grant applications electronically.  Effectiveness is improved by providing a single web site where the grants community can find and apply for grant opportunities, helping to ensure broad visibility of grant opportunities and participation from the most qualified and deserving grant applicants.  Lack of full funding for the investment will eliminate functional and operational improvements, which are needed to provide the stated benefits to additional grants programs, further improve the efficiency of the grant application process, and reduce long-term operations costs.  Significant reductions in funding would impact the ability to operate the system and provide existing services to 26 grant-making agencies and more than 100,000 grant applicants.","During FY11, Grants.gov provided ongoing operations that serviced more than 11 million Website visitors per month searching for grant opportunities and processed more than 200,000 application submissions.   In addition, Grants.gov made numerous improvements during FY11 through a controlled process of periodic releases.  Roughly 40 improvements were made in the areas of reliability and operability (CCR import, workflow, virus scanning, proprietary software removal, database optimization, etc.), security (password protection, account expiration, vulnerability patches, session timeouts, etc.), infrastructure (Oracle upgrade, search appliance update), usability (rejection comments), and functionality (bug fixes).

009-000001468,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"The Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) is a national standardized financial program that began operation in 2005. HIGLAS is a component of the department-wide effort of Health and Human Services Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). UFMS is a business transformation effort designed to integrate department-wide financial management systems and operations by aligning the Department's businesses with modern technological capabilities. HHS will use UFMS to satisfy the three categories of financial management systems requirements mandated by the FFMIA. These are Federal financial management systems requirements and the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP); Federal accounting standards; and the United States Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. CMS continues to closely coordinate efforts with DHHS to ensure HIGLAS core financial data integration with UFMS. The unification of the systems is aimed at improving data consolidation and financial reporting capabilities for all of DHHS. HIGLAS is a single, integrated dual-entry and FFMIA-compliant accounting system that processes the mission critical payment calculation for Medicare benefits to Part A and Part B, Medicaid Grants, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for the entire nation. HIGLAS also incorporates internal CMS administrative program accounting transactions.  HIGLAS represents the consolidation of two major CMS projects within the office of the CMS Chief Financial Officer. The first project, the Integrated General Ledger and Accounting System (IGLAS) project, was initiated to improve the accounting and financial management processes used by CMS's Medicare contractors to administer the Medicare Parts A and B programs. The Medicare contractors' accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and several reporting processes were deemed in particular need of improvement. The second project was an effort to improve the agency's central administrative accounting and financial management processes. This project, referred to as the Financial Accounting and Control Systems (FACS) redesign, entailed a replacement of CMS's legacy accounting system and the systems that currently support its procurement, travel management, grants management, and asset management. These two activities were combined into the HIGLAS project.","The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) requires each Federal agency to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with federal financial management systems requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and the US Standard General Ledger at the transition level.  The CMS Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) supports the DHHS' FFMIA compliance goals of accounting for the total CMS payment dollars (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and CMS Administrative Program Accounting) to be processed through HIGLAS by FY 2012. HIGLAS also supports OMB Circular A-127 requiring that agency financial statements be the culmination of a systematic accounting process. The statements are to be produced by an accounting system that is an integral part of a total financial management system containing sufficient structure, effective internal controls, and reliable data. HIGLAS is paramount towards the ability of DHHS to retain a clean audit opinion as required by the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) Act.  The improvements and benefits attributable to HIGLAS include reduced costs due to elimination of redundant individual Medicare financial record systems, improvements in automated Medicare debt collection/referral activities, creation of audit trails for every Medicare transaction/payment/claim in HIGLAS, improved Medicare financial audit ability, and improved capability for CMS to more systematically and efficiently recover identified Medicare Contractor overpayments.  HIGLAS implementation has also resulted in better internal financial controls across Medicare contractor operations.  Implementation of HIGLAS has a significant and positive impact on the amount of additional interest earned (saved) in the Medicare Trust Funds.  HIGLAS supports the agency's strategic mission goal of accurate and predictable payments by strengthening financial management of the Medicare program.  HIGLAS allows for more effective and efficient financial oversight and reporting of CMS program and administrative accounting. If this investment isn't fully funded, HIGLAS transitions could potentially be impacted, thereby placing CMS at a higher risk of not being able to meet the Agency's FFMIA compliance goals, as well as jeopardize the Agency's clean opinion on the CFO Audit.","Through FY2011, CMS has deployed HIGLAS at 14 traditional Medicare FFS contractor sites and 19 Medicare Administrative Contractor (MACs) sites. At present time, the total amount of CMS dollars accounted for in HIGLAS is greater than 96%.  HIGLAS processes approximately 3 - 4 million payment claims nightly, acting as the system-of-record for all Medicare Parts A, B, C, D, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance plan payments nationally.  Daily payments are approaching $1.5 billion.  These numbers will increase steadily through CY2012.","During FY 2012, CMS anticipates reaching 100 percent of FFMIA compliance with the planned transition of 7 additional MAC sites onto HIGLAS, as well as the transition of the Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Contractor.  We will also continue supporting the production and application maintenance at the 33 MAC/legacy Medicare contractor entities that will be utilizing HIGLAS by the end of FY 2011.   In FY 2013, our current System Integrator contract expires and we plan to transition to a new services contractor.  In addition, we plan to rollout the remaining internal CMS Administrative Program Accounting functionality to HIGLAS users.

E-Services modernize & improve CMS customer service through one-stop service by employing industry best practices in Customer Relationship Management. The result promotes access to quality health care and provides premier customer services to our special needs & elderly population.  This supports the promotion of open government and empowers our customers.Contact Center technology uses a single toll free # to connect callers to an Interactive Voice Response system (IVR), improving beneficiaries' ability to get information when & how they need it. The IVR will provide automated self-service information & transactions to callers. Based on selections made, callers will be routed to the next available, best qualified Agent using Intelligent Call Routing (ICR) software. The Next Generation Desktop (NGD) application accesses CMS data systems to answer Medicare inquiries on enrollment, claims, health care options, preventive services & prescription drug benefits; the NGD integration layer is also used by the IVR and MyMedicare.gov beneficiary portal to access data from a variety of CMS mainframe shared systems thus achieving cost efficiencies, improved manageability, data consistency & reduced systems development times & improved network security. This investment comprises the IT supporting 1-800 MEDICARE. Data from the various contact channels is stored in a data warehouse & will be leveraged to offer improved services to callers.The www.medicare.gov & www.cms.gov websites offer 1-stop shopping to beneficiaries, providers & CMS partners. www.medicare.gov has interactive tools on Medicare Plan Finder, Nursing Home & Hospital Compare & other tools. MyMedicare.gov beneficiary portal is a part of www.medicare.gov & allows users to log in & have access to personalized information such as enrollment, preventive services, claims, prescription drugs. www.cms.gov is the official Agency website targeted to healthcare professionals, policy makers, researchers, & the media.","This investment supports the Federal Health IT Policy Principle 1.2, Promote Open Government.  Relative to the Health Domain it aligns with the Health Care Administration (FEA BRM Sub-function 247) and consumer empowerment (FEA Segment Architecture 402).The Beneficiary eServices investment provides the Information Technology components necessary to support Contact Center Operations, the Agency's public websites (including www.Medicare.gov and www.CMS.gov) and the beneficiary web portal (MyMedicare.gov).   The CMS web program, including CMS.gov and Medicare.gov, handled over 1 billion page views in CY11. The public websites are the Agency's primary information distribution and customer service channel. A failure to fully fund these websites would result in significant increases in other customer service channels, including 1-800-MEDICARE call volumes, increased email & written correspondence, and increased FOIA requests. In addition, the Beneficiary eServices investment provides the Customer Relationship Management Tool necessary for the Customer Service Representatives to handle millions of beneficiary inquiries.  The Integrated Voice Response solution for 1-800-MEDICARE also relies on the Integration Layer which is also funded by the Beneficiary eServices investment. Any reduction in funding to Beneficiary eServices would result in significant cost impacts to other funding areas to accommodate the increased call volume and the development of another mechanism to provide the information currently provided to a growing beneficiary population.","The Beneficiary eServices investment refreshed WebChat, which provides beneficiaries with technical assistance with utilizing MyMedicare.gov, as well as provides claim and other information to reduce call volume.  The investment also refreshed Task UI for Medicare Secondary Payer questions. The Web program accomplishments included refreshment of the Medicare.gov website. This includes the Medicare Plan Finder, a tool which provided the separate Medicare Options Compare and Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder. For CMS.gov, the Medicare Coverage Database (MCD), the most visited application on the website, was also refreshed.  In addition, the investment refreshed the On The Go report and Blue Button capability in MyMedicare.gov.","Planned accomplishments include the patching of firmware, database, web server, and application server software to maintain system confidentiality, integrity, and availability to maintain the Authority to Operate for each respective accredited system.

009-000001902,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"The CMS mission is to ensure effective, up to date health care coverage and to promote quality care for beneficiaries. The Agency works with the health care community to improve the quality and efficiency in beneficiaries' programs, services, and care, and to promote the fiscal soundness of an evolving health care system in the United States. Today, CMS uses significant data center capacity provided by industry to support the IT Infrastructure requirements of the agency. The Baltimore Data Center (BDC) and the two Enterprise Data Centers, EDC1 and EDC2 are key IT Infrastructure resources utilized by CMS to meet its overall mission. All three data centers are currently operated under two separate contracts which limits competition and impedes coordination across all three of these data centers. CMS will reconcile these issues by bringing the three aforementioned data centers and additional data centers, currently operated outside the auspices of the CMS, Office of Information Services, under the umbrella of a single procurement vehicle. Toward these ends, CMS proposes the development of a comprehensive Virtual Data Center (VDC) ID/IQ that will expand upon concepts garnered from the existing EDC ID/IQ and ESD ID/IQ models.  This investment supports that effort.  Currently there are approximately 100 contractors working for CMS at approximately 200 sites. Under the VDC Strategy, OIS plans to award contracts to multiple companies. The VDC will support ongoing CMS efforts to consolidate CMS data center workloads and to comply with government-wide initiatives for cloud computing by offering cloud-like services through the VDC. The VDC aligns with all four high-level goals of the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (DCCI): promote the use of Green IT by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of government data centers, reduce cost of data center hardware, software and operations, increase over IT security posture of the government, and shift IT investments to more efficient computing platforms and technologies. As a result of this approach, we anticipate that all CMS work will be running in a much lower number of data centers within the next ten years.  The VDC provides the IT environment that supports all CMS claims and processing investments as well as many other investments.","This investment puts CMS in a better position to meet the growing demands on the agency (DCCI, ARRA, ACA, OMB 25-Point Implementation Plan, increasing beneficiary population, etc.), adhere to the increased security requirements, while:* Increasing competition, drive down cost amongst vendors and promote innovation while continuing to consolidate CMS Data Center Workloads as appropriate,* Establishing the capability to support high availability hosting, backup, and disaster recovery services between CMS Data Centers to maintain continuity of operations* Ensuring that all CMS Data Center Workloads adhere to the same contractual requirements for security, architecture and SDLC standards,* Providing an enterprise Development, Integration, Test, Validation environment that mirrors the Production environment,* Supporting the transformation of CMS into an information-focused organization at the center of the Federal Health Enterprise,* Establishing a process that will supports CMS and the Department's efforts to provide fair and impartial opportunity for small and disadvantaged businesses.If not fully funded, it will slow our progress in consolidating data centers (and reducing costs) and meeting the high-level goals of the Federal DCCI.","*  Implemented DISA STIG Security Requirement, CA View and SNA HATs,*  Required and provided Vanguard,*  Institute robust  monitoring, firewalls, and established alert conditions and direct SNMP traffic,*  Established environment virtualization,*  Networx migration.","*  Migration of databases and applications to standardize environments,*  Upgrade software for standardization,*  Institute common EFT for data transfer,*  Leverage virtualization strategies, where applicable, for all new business application and enterprise services hosting needs.",411.718,129.696,110.446,109.16,2006.0,2020.0,"The President's Budget is utilized to create funding targets for each of the CMS portfolios, however specific investments may have their funding adjusted to reflect re-evaluated Agency priorities.","Older contracts do not contain an official EVM clause because it was not required at the time the contract was issued.

The MCS is one of the shared systems used to process Medicare Part B claims for physician care, durable medical equipment, and other outpatient services nationwide.  It interfaces directly with the Common Working File (CWF) MCS meets CMS' core requirements for processing Medicare Part B claims, to include: data collection and validation, claims control, pricing, adjudication, correspondence, on-line inquiry, file maintenance, reimbursement, and financial processing.  The FFS claims processing environment is distributed across four claims processing modules and one integrated testing module.The MCS has four quarterly releases that control, implement, and update software changes due to legislative mandates that dictate the amount of payment for services or coverage levels.  Additionally, MCS must also implement changes needed to support the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority for the Medicare FFS Program.  Software changes for the claims processing operations are managed in quarterly releases developed through a change control process that begins with the Medicare Change Control Board (MCCB) review and prioritization of pending requests.  The FFS Operations Board approves the quarterly releases with oversight by the FFS Governance Council and manages/integrates day-to-day operations of the FFS program across CMS.  Error-free releases that implement legislative mandates with minimal interruption to processing ensure that beneficiaries receive the correct service and providers receive the correct payment.  This investment also includes the Medicare Pt. B Drugs Average Sales Price Reporting Database, an automated, web-based, secure database to allow drug manufacturers to report quarterly drug sales information.","The Multi Carrier Systme (MCS) is a critical component of the Fee For Service (FFS) program, processing millions of Medicare claims a year, supporting Medicare's mission to provide quality health care to beneficiaries.  The MCS software directly supports the Improved Financial Performance, as it is an essential component for ensuring that accurate Part B payments are made for medically necessary services and are provided to eligible beneficiaries by qualified providers of care.  Not funding MCS would be detrimental to Medicare, causing harmful delays in processing/ payment of Part B claims, reducing the access, availability, and provision of health care services to Medicare beneficiaries.","The MCS claims processing system implemented four quarterly releases that control, implement, and update software changes due to legislative mandates that dictated the amount of payment for services or coverage levels.","The MCS claims processing system will implement four quarterly releases that will control, implement, and refresh software due to legislative mandates that dictate the amount of payment for services or coverage levels.",48.463,17.415,17.35,18.133,2009.0,2020.0,The current funding levels for this investment were developed through the CMS' annual CPIC process.

009-000004258,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"HPMS manages the following plan enrollment processes for the Medicare Advantage and Part D (MAPD) programs: application, bid, and formulary submissions, marketing material reviews, plan oversight, complaints tracking, operational data feeds for enrollment and payment, and data support for the Medicare & You handbook and www.medicare.gov. HPMS supports these processes for all private plans in the MAPD programs. As the central e-government system for managing the day-to-day operations of these programs, HPMS ensures that there is a single mechanism by which plans and CMS can communicate electronically in a secure and efficient manner. With limited staff resources, HPMS is critical to CMS in managing the nearly 800 MA and PDP organizations to ensure that they are fulfilling the significant number of statutory, regulatory, and administrative requirements of the MAPD programs. The HPMS investment contributes to the Transform Health Care goal in the HHS Strategic Plan as well as to the Excellence in Operations and Improving the Care of Individuals goals of the CMS Strategic Action Plan. A primary mission of HPMS is to support the addition of new contract and plan choices to increase the accessibility and availability of drug and health plans to Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, HPMS functionality enables the agency to negotiate with plans for quality benefit packages at a reasonable cost to the beneficiary and the government. Finally, HPMS collects detailed plan benefit data for use in beneficiary education tools and provides for the review and approval of plan marketing materials. These activities ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to accurate and timely data and are well-prepared to select a plan that best suits their individual healthcare needs.This investment also makes significant contributions to an expanded e-government, implementation of the Federal Enterprise Architecture, and CMS' IT modernization blueprint. It builds the basic computing infrastructure needed to support several CMS systems; supports common standards and practices; and integrates security and privacy protections throughout the lifecycle. In addition to maintaining current operations, CMS will enhance the Plan Management Dashboard to add new key performance indicators for plan assessment, re-engineer the formulary submission process to gain efficiencies, and automate the review of retail pharmacy networks to strengthen the application review.","The HPMS investment closes the gap between the necessary annual plan enrollment lifecycle activities and the rigid timeframes in which these materials must be submitted by MA and Part D programs and reviewed and approved by CMS.  Without the HPMS automated processes, the submission and approval of these activities would be incomplete and inconsistent given the limited submission and review windows.   For example, the Health Service Delivery (HSD) review was previously done manually by CMS staff in different CMS regional offices, which resulted in inconsistent reviews of submitted applications.  No published standards were provided for MA organizations to ensure they were contracting with a sufficient number of providers and facilities to meet CMS' standards. With the automation of the HSD review, criteria has been published so MA applicants know the standards they must meet and all applicants are held to the same standardized review criteria.  CMS staff also now have time to further scrutinize other critical sections of the submitted application.  The Plan Benefit Package (PBP) tool provides standardized data entry so that MA and PDP organizations can describe their plan benefit packages, including information on premiums, cost sharing, authorization rules, and supplemental benefits.  The PBP software automatically generates the standardized sentences for the Summary of Benefits (SB) by using the plan benefit package data entered into the PBP software by the organization's user.  These standardized sentences are used by the MA and Part D organizations in their SB marketing materials and by CMS to generate plan benefits data for display in the Medicare & You handbook and on the www.medicare.gov website. Prior to the use of this tool, organizations submitted a narrative description of benefits, which had to be manually reviewed by CMS.  Data entry methods and terminology differed greatly across organizations.  No standardized sentences were generated and CMS staff had to manually create the data that displayed for the Medicare & You Handbook and on the www.medicare.gov website.  With the implementation of the PBP software, multiple review and standardization issues were resolved.","During the investment's prior year, the system was enhanced to include marketing surveillance.  This module provides CMS the ability to enter & review data in support of surveillance activities & effectuate compliance actions. Plans use this module to upload responses to deficiencies identified through marketing surveillance.   The HPMS investment made modifications to the Plan Management Dashboard, and included the integration of complaint metrics to monitor program performance.  The PBP software incorporated new cost share limitation rules, which reduced the number of non-compliant bid submissions by over 50%.The HPMS investment implemented  provisions outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub.L. 111-148) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub.L.111-152). This includes the collection & display of the Star Rating Quality Bonus Program, the Coverage Gap Discount program, & modifications to Direct & Indirect Remuneration data.","Planned accomplishments for the HPMS investment include streamlining the bid review process by incorporating external tools to calculate out of pocket costs and identify significant increases in cost-sharing or decreases in benefits for beneficiaries.  CMS will further enhance the Plan Management Dashboard for strategic planning, and will continue to refine the automated review of health service delivery tables.  The HPMS investment will enhance the existing PACE monitoring module to align with newly issued sub-regulatory guidance,  collect Quality Improvement Projects and Chronic Care Improvement Programs from MA organizations on an annual basis, and collect short-cycle dispensing information for Long Term Care facilities to reduce waste of unused dispensed medications.",46.442,20.139,19.401,19.426,1999.0,2020.0,This investment has gone through the CPIC process.

These systems provide CMS with an authoritative comprehensive database of individuals in the Medicare program to support ongoing program administration, service delivery, payment coverage options, enrollment and direct billing support. These systems reflect the individual's Medicare health insurance coverage and Medicare health plan and demonstration enrollment.  MBD data is relied upon by other agencies such as the states,Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) and Social Security Administration (SSA), many federal oversight and law enforcement agencies, and hundreds of research projects sponsored by both federal and private research institutions. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) legislation significantly expanded the role of the MBD, as well as adding significant changes to the size and functions of the system.The EDB is the authoritative source of Medicare Part A/B eligibility and entitlement information for 115 million beneficiaries with an annual enrollment of 2.5 million beneficiaries. The Enrollment system manages the data for each Medicare enrollee. The Billing Systems maintain billing/collection data for beneficiaries who pay their own premiums or have premiums paid by a third party.  EDB manages the Common Medicare Environment (CME) demographic tables. EDB data/services are CMS mission critical, including a tight partnership with other CMS mission critical systems--Medicare Beneficiary Database and Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MBD and MARx). The investment secures the resources needed to operate and maintain these systems within Federal Information Security Managment Act (FISMA) compliance and within CMS requirements.  Resources are allocated to maintain and update, test and monitor the operation of the systems that support the Beneficiary Enrollment Data Management functions, as well as provide related audit and compliance support, program management support and customer service to relevant stakeholders.This is a CMS mission critical investment.","CMS has a critical reliance on support contractors to carry out its mission of providing health insurance coverage for millions or American citizens.

The operational contracting offices used different systems and manual processes to support acquisitions, which complicated interfaces to financial and other HHS systems. To achieve its acquisition system standardization goals, HHS consolidated multiple configurations of HHS' COTS PRISM application. This consolidation effort is referred to as the HHS Consolidated Acquisition Solution (HCAS). HHS has deployed HCAS to the HHS contracting offices (excluding NIH, CMS, and CDC). The implementation of HCAS leveraged the Integrated Acquisition Environment e-gov initiative. HCAS was implemented on February 11, 2009.

009-000005317,9,Department of Health and Human Services,10,Food and Drug Administration,"The MARCS program is the primary IT mechanism for realizing ORA program goals that supports all FDA Field activities (except laboratories) including domestics, imports, and enforcement.  MARCS directly supports the surveillance and promotes the safety of all FDA regulated products except tobacco. It also directly supports the programs of the FDA Offices OF, OMPT, and OGROP, and FDA Centers CBER, CDER, CDRH, CFSAN, and CVM. MARCS is a Business Process Improvement (BPI) effort built from the ground up with integration in mind and forms an Enterprise Resource Planning system that spans all of the electronic work flows of ORA except for processes specific to ORA laboratories. It aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food and medical product safety and enables FDA Centers to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality and Safety of Manufactured Products and the Supply Chain.  FDA uses MARCS to: plan FDA field activities and assign staff to inspections, investigations, recalls, and other compliance activities; track and control samples and the results of laboratory analysis; collect and maintain information from field activities; collect performance data, particularly that related to FDAAA; send Prior Notice for food imports to Customs and accept import product information from Customs for screening; screen some 20 million import lines a year based on calculated risk (PREDICT); collect information about the facilities FDA regulates and those in the import supply chain for risk-based targeting; provide FDA Centers with information on inspections, compliance actions, recalls, laboratory analysis and facilities.   Primary beneficiaries of MARCS are the FDA personnel conducting surveillance and regulatory activities.  This extends to the public as MARCS enables these surveillance and regulatory activities.  MARCS is closely coupled with two other major ORA investments, ALM and RBIS.  ALM provides functionality for ORA laboratories and quality.  RBIS provides reporting and information on some 5 million foreign and domestic firms.  Together, these three investments provide for all of the regulatory workflows of ORA. MARCS also interacts with FURLS, eLIST, and a number of smaller systems at FDA.","Because much of the data and work conducted by the FDA Centers converge within ORA, ORA faces a particular set of performance gaps - e.g., the ability to integrate data in various formats with divergent data definitions; work flows that begin in a number of different states and progress through various organizations; functionalities that are divided into different systems; and the fragility of point-to-point integration schemes that have been built up over time.MARCS is a complete departure from the past which was characterized by organic growth in response to particular needs without an ability to consider the holistic Agency needs. MARCS is being built from the ground with SOA using an ESB coupled with a BPMS and technologies to support offline and Remote Access Device (RAD) usage. SOA allows MARCS to build and reuse functionality that in the past has been duplicated multiple times with different implementations. Now, functionalities can be shared both across MARCS and with other related programs including ALM and RBIS. The ESB solves the problem of fragile point-to-point integration resulting in more robust and higher performance systems. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows. This also brings the building and modifying of work flows closer to Federal business personnel as the graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a much more accurate and useful work flow in the final product and shortens times to modify work flows. MARCS is producing shared services in accordance with point 6 of the 25 point IT reform plan.Much of the work performed by ORA personnel is done in remote areas without network connectivity. This has never been comprehensively addressed by ORA.  MARCS is designed to inherently support off-line/on-line operations through RADs - handheld devices that will improve the efficiency of field staff in completing work not done in an FDA office and when connectivity may be intermittent. MARCS is doing a holistic RADs implementation based on field integration and infrastructure requirements.If MARCS is not fully funded, then the movement towards this future structure will be delayed and work will need to continue to support poorly performing systems that keep breaking down as more demand and integration is placed onto them. Continuing to operate with these legacy systems will undermine ORAs ability to perform its mission.","MARCS has produced a number of useful components or project segments in the prior year.  This includesData Sharing Services (DSS) to support sharing data between ORA and the Centers.Notification Services (NS) to provide notifications by email and fax.Standardized Evidence and Reference Services (SERS) updates to provide access to electronic documents.Work Assignment and Accomplishment Manager (WAAM) for Recall Audit Checks (RAC) to support RAC functionality.

009-000005318,9,Department of Health and Human Services,10,Food and Drug Administration,"ALM encompasses QMiS, eLEXNET, and LIMS. It provides for ORA wide program quality, sample analysis information sharing across ORA and with external partners, and increased throughput via laboratory automation. ALM aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food/medical product safety; and to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality/Safety of Manufactured Products/Supply Chain. QMiS supports program quality across FDA. This includes the review, continuous improvement, and auditing of work product from the regulatory work flows of ORA. QMiS also directly supports the accreditation of the 16 ORA labs. eLEXNET allows the exchange of lab analysis data between over 100 public health labs at the Federal, state, and local levels including an interface with DHS' National Bio-surveillance Integration System. It is the system for the Food Emergency Response Network and is thus an integral piece in protecting against bioterrorism. LIMS is an envisioned ORA wide COTS solution for automating laboratory work that is currently done manually. This will significantly increase throughput and is expected to at least double the current capacity of ORA laboratories. This is a key component to supporting the FDA Science Strategic Plan. Primary beneficiaries of ALM are quality managers, organizations participating in eLEXNET, and the personnel in the ORA labs. This extends to the public as ALM enables protecting and promoting the public health.ALM will result in reduced response times in health emergencies due to increased laboratory throughput and leveraging external partners and in increased quality for repeatability of results and directly supports the ORA mission of protecting and promoting the public health.ALM has significant dependencies on both MARCS and RBIS for work flow and reporting.ALM forms a comprehensive solution for sample analysis that incorporates quality, internal laboratories, and external partners. It is a proven success in leveraging external partners through cooperative agreements and a useful and reliable IT system.ALM has a planned end date of 9/30/2014. FDA is exploring the possibility of combining ALM, MARCS, and RBIS into one investment since together they support ORA regulatory work flows. This analysis will be completed in FY12. ALM is now being reported as ending pending the results of this analysis.","ORA is a geographically dispersed organization with many processes having grown up organically over decades. QMiS addresses these differences by using a systematic approach towards quality and standardization. This involves a cultural change within the organization and will take time to be accepted.  eLEXNET provides a proven method of interfacing with external partners, particularly DHS. In the case of a bioterrorism emergency, cooperation between Federal agencies and private partners will be paramount. eLEXNET provides a robust, fully redundant, and reliable system to do this.  ORA has seen a steep growth in the demand for sample analysis while many essential processes are not yet automated. All of the 16 ORA laboratories use manual paper based processes.  LIMS is being implemented to change this to automate the laboratories from top to bottom. This will increase accuracy, throughput, and staff efficiency. The demand for sample analysis work from the ORA laboratories is only expected to grow.  Without an automated system, it will be virtually impossible for laboratories using manual processes to meet the needs of the organization.  eLEXNET was the first system at FDA to take a SOA approach coupled with a BPMS. Both LIMS and MARCS are being designed to extend this approach. This provides ORA with an architecture that supports integration and information interchange from the ground up. SOA provides the technical backbone for this approach. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows and enables Federal business personnel to build and modify work flows as graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a more accurate and useful final product work flow and cuts modification time.  ALM fills the current performance gap by providing improved quality, external partner communications, and laboratory automation. This improves repeatability, communication, addresses chain of custody legal needs, increases laboratory throughput, and reduces response time to public health emergencies.  Not fully funding ALM will delay these benefits and could result in ORA laboratories not being able to process samples as needed by the organization.","PY accomplishments:eLEXNET: continued implementation of extranet based/externally hosted service sharing real-time food safety information system for proactive collaboration with federal/state/local government labs. 24x7system availability with help desk support O&M plus security, troubleshooting/problem resolution incorporating National Biosurveillance Integration System and Electronic Laboratory Exchange Network (NEIS) -interface with DHS' National Bio-surveillance Integration SystemStandardized data web-based interfaces Design/Pilot - common login QMIS: Deployment of first release.

UFFMS functions directly enable compliance with the following legislation: Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA); Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA); Color Certification (CERTS); Exports Certificate (Exports); Medical Device User Fee Act (MDUFMA); Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA); Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA); Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco).Contracts that support UFFRS operate, maintain and enhance three systems that collectively support the spending plans for the User Fee program and associated 5 year plans, and prepare the cost reporting needed to ensure statutory triggers are met. Contracts that support UFFRS operate, maintain and enhance three systems that collectively support the spending plans for the User Fee program and associated 5 year plans, and prepare the cost reporting needed to ensure statutory triggers are met.   1) The User Fee System (UFS) processes accounts receivable for user fee invoicing, collections, reconciliation with UFMS and detail reporting. 2) FDA's Hyperion reporting system captures data at a summarized level, rather than at an individual transaction level.  It is used to project the impact of User Fees FDA budgets, obligations, and expenditures. 3) The Business Intelligence Reporting System (BIRS) supports managerial reporting needs including web assess to user fee information.  BIRS uses Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition Plus (OBIEE) to provide business visibility and insight into the collection and use of User Fee revenues.  UFFRS systems interface with HHS' Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) for both payment related processes, budget management and report generation, and changes to UFMS operations or features must be reflected in the UFFRS systems.","FDA's regulatory mission could not be met without the fees mandated by User Fee legislation and collected, managed and reported through UFFRS. The fees processed are a significant portion of FDA's budget. Many FDA missions would suffer if user fees are tracked from collection to work performed. Three quarters of the annual investment budget is for O&M activities that support user fee management. They include:- licenses support from the COTS vendors and technical upgrades to the COTS product to maintain our vendor support agreements; - software upgrades to remain compliant with increasing security requirements and FDA's Production environment;  - help desk support; operation of the critical interfaces with UFMS including nightly extract, transfer, and load activities (ETL); - ongoing training, and changes needed to retain compatibility with UFMS. The cost for such support is reflected in the recently awarded contracts for fixed price operational support for the next five years. Although UFFRS meets current requirements, the user fee environment has been and continues to be dynamic. Changes expected in the next three years include: full implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act; actions on Generic Drugs that will affect User Fees collections; demands for integrating additional data sources to improve the capabilities of BIRS; and a planned Oracle database upgrade. Changes to the FDA budget may require realignment that will trigger additional forecasting and reporting needs since User Fees are a significant source of FDA revenues; UFS, BIRS and Hyperion will require modification. Estimates for these costs are included in the new contracts.The ability to collect and adequately track and report approximately one billion dollars in revenue generated by user fees is critical to FDA and to HHS. Failure to maintain the automated capability to ensure adequate collection and accountability would have a serious negative impact on FDA. Comprehensive requirements for reporting are included in the legislation which FDA must meet to satisfy Congress and industry, as well as the general public. In addition, significant cuts could require partial or total termination of current contracts. The User Fee program is a valued source of revenue for FDA and many of its programs.  Cuts to the UFFMS investment which would make it less able to collect and manage User Fees  would be counter-productive at best.","In addition to transitioning to new vendors on FFP contacts, accomplishments include: 1) BIRS. Improved automation through scripts to increase the efficiency of automated stakeholder notification of ETL success; substantially improved query response time on multiple reports (e.g. decreased time from > 5 minutes to < 1 second); additional reports to address OFM Director needs, e.g. AR reconciliation, Treasury Account Symbol reporting.2) Hyperion Planning. Consistently executed data loads; improved communications with Data Center through updated troubleshooting processes and increased frequency of interaction; eliminated of bugs in existing Hyperion reports.3) User Fee: Migrated Lockboxes to US Bank for 7 programs; automated Congressional reporting, Billing Solution, and Un-earned Revenue for MDUFMA; implemented Priority Review Voucher (PRV) for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD); automated refund processing, incorporating automated refund status report and variance reporting.","As noted in response to Question 2, all UFFRS systems are in the Operations and Maintenance phase of their lifecycle. Three-quarters of the annual UFFRS budget is for O&M activities. The primary objective for FY12 and FY13 is to maintain at least the current standards of performance for existing services and, where possible, to improve them as was done in FY11. Operational services required by the new User Fee System contract include: 1) operations, support, and maintenance and 2) operational and financial reporting, and financial management. Services contractually required for BIRS include support and maintenance including data extracts, transfers, and loads (ETL) from HHS' UFMS, system monitoring and trouble-shooting, customer service and security support. Services required for Hyperion also include data loads, customer and security support, and maintenance services. Planned operational improvements include: Incorporating the application(s) into an automated ticketing system, Automating configuration management, and Improving the process for migration of data form development to test to production. Planned and probable enhancements include those needed to adapt to changes in business and/or the FDA technical environment. Significant challenges include responding to food safety legislation, actions on generic drugs that will affect User Fees collection, demands for integration of additional data sources to improve the capabilities of BIRS, and the planned Oracle upgrade. Congressional actions may also require budget realignments that could trigger additional forecasting and reporting needs since User Fee dollars are a source of FDA revenues. Two of these enhancements were started in FY11 and will continue into FY12: 1) FSMA legislation passed in 2011 authorized FDA to begin collecting fees for issuance of export certificates for animal feed and food product. To comply with FSMA, the User Fee systems need to be enhanced to collect fees for food and animal feed export certificates and to report related financial impacts. 2)Because FDA OIM is upgrading its database to Oracle 11g the User Fee system and its associated Rapid DataMart must also be upgraded.

010-000000363,10,Department of the Interior,0,Department of the Interior,"iRWIn will provide a progressive and modular implementation of an end-to-end interagency wildland fire reporting capability that includes integrated and coordinated processes for collecting, reporting, and updating relevant and timely wildland fire information. Federal agencies that have management and administrative responsibility for large areas of federal land also have the legal authority to protect those lands from the adverse effects of wildfire. Wildland fires are hazardous events that threaten the safety of the general public as well as agency personnel.  Wildland fires often move across or take place in multiple emergency response jurisdictions (e.g., BLM, National Park Service, Forest Service, States, Counties, Municipalities), creating a formidable challenge to coordinating the management of a wildland fire.  As well, characterizing the entire fire event lifecycle in a historical context.   iRWin will reduce multiple instances of redundant data entry across wildland fire information systems.  Moreover, iRWIn will promote consistency in providing updated fire data across information systems that produce or contain data related to wildland fire. iRWIn will also promote a consistent and repeatable process to gather information that describe wildland fires.   This information will provide agency personnel with a consolidated view of  wildland fire data, including the important context of source of the data, the timeliness of the data, how the data sources relate, and the statistical relevance of the information.iRWIn stakeholders will primarily benefit from a consistent, repeatable, and uniform processes (and supporting systems) to collect current and historical information regarding wildland fire.  Examples of wildland fire information includes:  fire location; status of fire suppression operations; financial accounting and staffing statistics; resources deployed to support the operations (aircraft; personnel, fire engines, etc.); local condition information (such as topology, vegetation inventory, soil composition); situational analysis of the fire compiled from predictive models (e.g., WFDSS); and, current and historical weather conditions.  Key Beneficiaries include: Fire Dispatch Personnel, Public Information Officers, Fire Incident Management Personnel, Budget and Finance Personnel, Planning and Research Personnel, Wildland Fire Executive Leadership.","At present a key performance gap is redundant data entry.  Data associated with a wildland fire that is initially entered into a computer aided dispatch (CAD) systems by local area fire dispatch staff throughout the country, is re-entered into other agency systems during the event lifecycle of the fire, and reentered again to collate and report wildland fire statistics.  This is confirmed in a 2008 interagency efficiency report identifying that an interagency dispatcher may have to enter fire location data in up to 26 different information systems to record descriptive information regarding an active wildland fire.  Once information is retrieved from each system, another performance gap is the lack of capability to synchronize updated fire data in the related information systems as more accurate information becomes available.Wildland fires are managed, both operationally and strategically, at local, regional, and national levels.  A current performance gap at regional and national levels is a lack of automated visibility into the deployment status of local resources (personnel, equipment, etc.).  This visibility would support more proactive response as wildland fires evolve.  Delays due to the current complexities in accessing wildland fire data from multiple sources places firefighting personnel at risk, due to potential delays in deploying fire resources.  Additionally, accessing multiple systems presents a cost burden associated with retrieving data from multiple systems, conducting redundant data entry, and compiling information from multiple systems into a consolidated view of relevant wildland fire data.At a strategic level, aggregating wildland fire information for the purposes of conducting budget and operations management, and evaluating effectiveness of wildland fire management policy, is hampered by process of collecting wildland fire statistics and outcomes from multiple information systems.  Often, certain statistical information appears to be in conflict across various data sources.  This results in lower quality management decisions due to the current process for retrieving outcome data for wildland fires.  Moreover, extensive cost burden is associated with the retrieval of data from multiple systems, compiling aggregate information, and resolving discrepancies in the data retrieved.If the investment is not fully funded the current performance gap will continue impairing the effectiveness of personnel responding to wildland fires.",1.

010-000001048,10,Department of the Interior,12,United States Geological Survey,"The FY 2012 White House budget document, Terminations, Savings and Reductions, specifies that the NBII is to be terminated due to duplication with other systems such as data.gov and requests funding of $0 in FY 2012 for this investment. In response to this directive, hundreds of assets including applications, tools, datasets, databases and Web resources are being evaluated for disposition. In cases where applications or data have been owned and curated by partners with USGS assistance, a small percentage of these assets may continue to be maintained by their parent organizations without further assistance. However, many will no longer be available online. NBII will terminate on January 15, 2012, with other investment closeout documentation activities completed by the end of the fiscal year. Following termination, the NBII will no longer provide service to more than 3 million customers who downloaded an average of nearly a terabyte of data per month.NBII enhanced transparency for data from scientific organizations within and outside of the Federal government, and has been a contributor to data.gov. It responds to A-130, making Federal data and information available and useful to the government and the public. As a federation that has included over 70 Federal organizations, over 65 state and local organizations; nearly 60 universities and more than 50 NGOs, it provides access to high quality natural resources data, information and tools produced by credible scientific organizations from all sectors. This critical capability allows scientists, resource managers, decision makers and others access to broad array of data to formulate the most complete picture possible of the latest state of the resource or challenge they are addressing (e.g. invasive species). The NBII was created following publication of a 1987 report detailing a requirement from the natural resources community for better access to the vast body of existing natural resource data to address environmental challenges. The National Research Council confirmed this need in 1993 with in &quot;A Biological Survey for the Nation,&quot; charging DOI with creating a national system. The NBII began in 1994. In 1998, a White House panel of experts published &quot;Teaming with Life&quot;, which, in part, commended NBII for its work in developing, promoting and implementing national and global data/information documentation and exchange standards, and issued direction for the next decade.","Following NBII's termination, the gap it was designed to close will widen in that there will be no single source from which users can access high quality biologically-relevant data and information from reliable scientific sources in all sectors. While data.gov has recently become available as a Federal data repository with enormous breadth across disciplines, it is not designed to reach beyond the Federal government, which means it does not provide access to the depth of data needed to meet natural resource challenges, much of which exists outside of government. Therefore, the gap identified by the natural resources community in 1987 and validated by the National Research Council in 1993 will not be filled. Three factors affect this gap. First, NBII's design as a federation of partners allowed it to assist data owners in maintaining critical assets that then were made available through the NBII. Without this assistance, many of these source organizations may not be able to continue on their own to make the assets available to scientists, resource managers, decision makers and others. Second, to access data directly from their source organizations, users must know the data exist and know where to look for them. While some may be identifiable through a simple Google search, many, many more are deeply embedded in the Web, residing as entities within structured databases. This type of access requires a federated search capability, which NBII posessed.Finally, tests revealed that identifying and accessing data and information through the NBII was as much as 5 times faster than locating the same resources through Google due to the fact that the NBII aggregated the resources in one place. As an example, the director of a refuge looking for best practices for pollinator management might conduct an NBII search that identified 97 pollinator management plans on refuges. The director is unlikely to have known of all of these plans to have been able to seek them out individually from their source organizations. Some of these plans might well be returned as search results using Google, but would be embedded in thousands of hits returned by the search, most of them irrelevant. And even with an NBII-generated list of the titles and authors of the plans, it took testers an average of 5 minutes per plan to locate these resources using Google, since they tended to be buried within millions of search results.","(1) In the last year, NBII served over 3 million customers who downloaded nearly a terabyte of data per month. (2) Program backup and restoration efforts were significantly improved through the evaluation and purchase of a new distributed storage array and backup system.  Over 15 terabytes of additional storage became available to program applications and users. Daily, weekly, and on-demand backup processing time was also significantly reduced. Servers are replaced approximately every three to five years depending upon performance and efficiencies to be gained through migration to newer technology. (3) All performance targets were met or exceeded and cost/schedule variances remained within acceptable parameters.","In FY 2012 (CY), NBII will complete all actions required to effect termination of the system. Due to the budget request of $0 in FY 2012, the investment's online presence will cease to exist in January. However, USGS will expend resources throughout FY 2012 to affect an orderly closeout and to ensure that all decommissioning activities are fully documented.

010-000000086,10,Department of the Interior,4,Bureau of Land Management,"The Automated Fluid Minerals Support System (AFMSS) is in O&amp;M. AFMSS is a BLM workload support system that facilitates the collection, management, and sharing of information on authorized use of fluid minerals (i.e., oil, gas, geothermal and helium), regulatory well permits/reports, and field operations inspection/enforcement data across Federal onshore operations on public lands.  The project was chartered in May 1993. AFMSS core data includes leases, agreements, wells, production, approvals of operations bond and surety information, and operator compliance. AFMSS is accessed through a Citrix-based, centralized client-server. AFMSS consists of server-based internal functionality and the Well Information System (WIS), which uses the eForms technology. An MOU was signed in March 2006 between the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) which designated AFMSS/WIS as joint systems under the Energy Act. Approximately 2084 BLM personnel and 250 users of the Offices of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) Financial Accounting System access AFMSS.  Approximately 490 lessee/operators access WIS.AFMSS supports the mission areas  Resource Protection and Resource Use  by providing a record of mineral resource use authorizations and inspection/enforcement activities and providing management with the appropriate and timely information to effectively promote/manage resource protection and use while sustaining a dynamic economy. AFMSS supports the mission area  Serving Communities  by providing use authorization and inspection/enforcement information from our Nation s mineral estate cases.  WIS supports electronic commerce capabilities and the Department s Strategic direction for improving Trust Management and providing e-commerce opportunities.AFMSS interfaces with:  The BLM Application Security System (BASS) which controls all user access to AFMSS.  LR2000. This eliminates redundant data entry between the two systems for commonly used data sets, allows the BLM bond data to be accessed by AFMSS for conducting bond reviews as they relate to wells and provides LR2000 access to AFMSS well and bond review information.  ONRR Financial Accounting System data exchanges of production information from the ONRR to AFMSS, and updated well reference information from AFMSS to the ONRR.","AFMSS was originally a set of 31 distributed systems that were subsequently divided into a separate Indian AFMSS environment and non-Indian AFMSS environment on separate servers. AFMSS &amp; WIS are critical to the BLM's implementation of the President's National Energy Policy (NEP) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. AFMSS supports NEP through:  Streamlining of the approval process for Applications for Permit to Drill.  Enhancement of inspection and enforcement capabilities to ensure that inspections are completed and lessee/operators are notified of corrective action requirements in a timely manner. Improvement and streamlining of the management of the NEPA process for energy resource proposals with surface-management bureaus, offices, and affected agencies. Providing access to data/information used to develop guidance to ensure meaningful consultation with Federally recognized Tribal governments on matters that affect Tribal communities. Providing access to data/information on regulation and policy changes relative to liability and reclamation, including the lease assignment approval policy and process, the orphan well policy relating to legacy wells, and single bond and common stipulations for lease and related off-lease facilities and roads.If not fully funded, key areas impacted will be: Development of interfaces to LR2000 Bond and Surety, LR2000 Case Recordation, and BLM State GIS Systems. Automation of processes for submitting, processing, and viewing the approval status of well permits and changes in the status of approved drilling operations. Enhancement of GIS capabilities for access to data from outside agencies (e.g., State Oil and Gas Commissions) and implementation of digital imagery capability for monitoring and inspection of existing/planned drilling sites and areas of potential surface disturbances. Integration with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) system functions, workflows, and documentation capabilities provided by Pinedale Computer Assisted Resource Assessment Tool (CARAT), Buffalo NEPA CISCoAT, and BLM s ePlanning.","Prior Year Accomplishments:  In FY2010 the AFMSS Inspection Billing (AIB) feature was developed, which allows AFMSS to communicate with the BLM Collections and Billings System (CBS) and the Standard Billings (BX) interface. AIB is the mechanism to create bills, cancel bills, and resubmit bills. and will permit the BLM to bill for onshore oil and gas operators for cases that are subject to inspection. AIB will maintain the federal and Indian cases so they remain separate.","CY and BY planned accomplishments include:   Upgrade AFMSS to a web-based environment (an environment that would ultimately enable easier integration with the LR2000 subsystems - Case Recordation and Bond &amp; Surety).   Consolidate the Non-Indian databases where possible to massively reduce administration costs and facilitate Bureau-wide reporting. Each individual Indian database must be maintained separately and are not eligible for consolidation.  Implement the WIS SP integration project to improve the customer satisfaction and system availability by incorporating the stable and secure Probaris SP application into the well permit application process.

The LOMAS investment enables Indian Affairs to promote the economic development of tribes and individual American Indians and Alaskan Natives by providing financial assistance through guaranteed loans, insured loans, and payment of interest subsidies via a program know as the Indian Affairs Loan Guaranty, Insurance and Interest Subsidy Program. The Indian Financing Act of 1974, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, and Congressional Declaration of Policy authorized Indian Affairs to help Native Americans and Native American companies gain access to capital by guaranteeing and insuring private sector loans. Initial planning for the Guaranteed Loan Accounting System (GLAS), the LOMAS Replacement investment, began in FY2009, including the purchase of ORACLE software licenses. The current LOMAS is scheduled to continue until the GLAS is ready to be deployed in FY2013.","If full-funding is not received, the current LOMAS would need to cut back its part-time SmallTalk programming support. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) would be restricted in its negotiations with the National Business Center (NBC) to agree upon a worst-case funding scenario for a part-time SmallTalk programming support. The programmer, whose cost has not exceeded $132,000 in the past four (4) years, would be limited in the amount of programming services. Indian Affairs is legally bound to perform loan processing as stated in the Indian Financing Act of 1974. Additionally, commercial lending institutions were not lending sufficient funds to Indian communities without the establishment of the loan guarantees and loan subsidies that are more efficiently made through the use of LOMAS (existing system as well as proposed). Therefore, the economic improvement fostered by the loan guarantee program and assisted through the use of LOMAS cannot be done by the private sector. An unfunded LOMAS investment would cease acting to coordinate the making and servicing of loans and would cease acting to service, collect, and track the repayment of loans made by Indian Affairs. All of the electronic processes would have to be converted to manual processes. All participating commercial banks would have to comply with the manual process, including the transfer of information by mail or FAX with no electronic means of data transfer available. Any prospective Native American applicants and any potential new commercial lending institutions would have to apply through a new manual process that must be developed and advertised. Without the automated LOMAS system, Indian Affairs would not have the manpower to process and track every loan, therefore fewer jobs would be created or sustained by the Indian Affairs loan program.

010-000000310,10,Department of the Interior,0,Department of the Interior,"The FMMS investment is to implement a common facility management system based on a commercial-off-the-shelf product, across the land managing bureaus' with the flexibility to meet multiple missions. FMMS will provide a method for the DOI to collect and analyze comparable facility information from all bureaus. FMMS is a collaborative initiative involving multiple bureaus within the DOI. As a result of an OMB TechStat review, DOI management decided that going forward FMMS includes the Bureaus of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Business Center (NBC) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  DOI's goal is to continue improvements in facility/asset management transaction processing, analysis, and reporting and to enhance management systems support through an effective partnership of program, information system, and facility managers. DOI relies on facility management systems to track, inventory, manage, and operate and maintain its numerous assets.Traditionally the Department s facility management systems architecture has included many systems managed at the bureau level. DOI has viewed the movement toward a single, integrated system architecture as encompassing four interrelated elements that drive business process improvements, and financial integrity. They are:(1) improvement of internal controls;(2) elimination of redundant data entry;(3) enabling end-to-end transaction processing; and(4) standardization of data for improved information quality and transparencyEach Bureau operates and developed separate instances of MAXIMO today.  In order to increase efficiencies, streamline processes, and realize cost savings, DOI will consolidate the bureaus' facility maintenance management system instances into a single solution which allows the system to integrate with the Financial and Business Management System (FBMS).The transition to the single solution has left the investment in the mixed life-cycle mode.","As a result of an OMB TechStat review, DOI management decided that the National Park Service (NPS) and Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) will still submit separate Exhibit 300 business cases for their investments. DOI owns and operates over 34,000 buildings, 120,000 miles of roads, and a wide variety of other constructed assets. These facilities serve nearly 380 million visitors annually and provide schooling for 53,000 Native American children and a place of work for 70,000 DOI full time employees, 20,000 seasonal employees, and over 200,000 volunteers with the value of assets measured in the billions of dollars. Many are priceless for their historical significance. Each of the 5 included bureaus operate a separate instances of MAXIMO. In order to increase efficiencies in facility maintenance and management, streamline processes, and realize cost savings DOI will consolidate bureau MAXIMO instances into an DOI Enterprise system based upon collaborative standards and requirements from all bureaus. Until FY 2012, the transition to the single solution has left the bureaus child projects in the operations and maintenance mode. DOI is developing common business requirements to develop FMMS for the included five bureau. The Department will consolidate purchases of hardware and software, licenses, configuration models and support a single platform solution that enables Interior to retire redundant systems and have a seamless interface with FBMS. The current FBMS implementation can support an interface from FMMS but this FMMS investment must build that interface.","In FY11 FMMS:   - Used the Business Requirements document to develop a statement of work for contractor support for single system development, integration, and deployment.  - Determined Governance for Integrated Project Management.    - Established Change Control Board Identify and assign local, Bureau-level responsibilities for system management [September 30, 2011].  - Determine the charter, participants and change management process prior to the start of any development or application configuration [September 30, 2011]. - Identify and assign enterprise, Department-level responsibilities for system management underwent many changes to the scope and direction for the single system solution. - Conducted gap analysis of facility system to ease the transition for integration with FBMS. - Developed the interface between FBMS and and FMMS.  - Began the transition of the National Business Center and Bureau of Indian Affairs systems to the FMMS solution.","FMMS plans to accomplish the folling milestone in the CY12 and BY 13:Establish Enterprise Development, Test, and Production Environments - Plan for and set up the development, system test, user-acceptance test and production environments.Build a system Migration Plan: - Document and gain approval for migration of bureau-instances into DOI enterprise FMMS [March 31, 2012]. - Begin Migration activities into DOI enterprise FMMS   [Start Date - June 30, 2012]. - Deliver FWS Development Enhancements. - Complete Testing of FWS Release. - Complete FWS Production Data Conversion. - Go Live with FWS on Enterprise Version. - Address issues discovered with Go Live bureau implementation [Start Date - September 30, 2012]. - Migrate updates for staging and production environments.Repeat DOI enterprise FMMS migration milestones for  - BIA [Start Date - December 31, 2012] - Based on Migration Plan, configure enterprise FMMS and migrate Bureau systems.

CARMA is composed of several software elements:  Maximo Asset Management (Maximo), Actuate, Oracle RDBMS, and Reclamation Corporate Data Warehouse.  The Maximo suite is the core package for DOI's adopted FMS.   The FMS project was chartered on 8/2/05 and entered the first initial production state on 6/07, full implementation occurred on August 2009, with CARMA as a component.  As the result of an OMB TechStat evaluation of FMS in 2010 it was recommended and agreed by all parties (DOI, Reclamation and OMB), that CARMA should be segregated from FMS and become an independent Major IT Investment.  2010 is the first submission of the stand alone Reclamation CARMA IT Investment.This investment consolidates 18 independent implementations of Maximo version 4.1.1 into a single installation of IBM Maximo asset management version 6.x located in the Denver corporate office, with integration with Reclamation  ETAS time and attendance system. It is configured to meet the strategic goals and objectives of DOI and Reclamation s Asset Management Plan, Managing for Excellence, and Business Standards for Asset and Maintenance Management.","CARMA provides strategic approach to asset management and the overarching goals of delivery reliability, cost, effectiveness, safety and security, and Western Interconnection support.  Benefits of the investment include internal and external customers.  Support for NERC compliance for Reclamation's Power Facilities is performed by CARMA.Reclamation's business line closely aligns with the utility industry (delivering water and power) and the principal use of MAXIMO is to support maintenance management at major hydroelectric generation sites.  Reclamation is the nation's largest wholesale water supplier and the second largest producer of hydropower in the United States.  Reclamation has utilized MAXIMO to support these functions since 1995.  Reclamation evaluated decentralized architecture with eighteen autonomous sites, semi-consolidated architecture, and consolidated upgrade architecture based on business need and technology availability.  Also, in the consolidation of MAXIMO systems factors such as maintaining historical information for knowledge transfer, support of enterprise software licensing, meeting security requirements, and standardization of business processes were evaluated.  In 2010, based on these factors aforementioned, the investment increased efficiences and avoided cost due to changing business and technology needs.Currently the CARMA team is evaluating the use of new planning and scheduling tools to improve efficiencies and potentially reduce costs as this tool may replace the existing tool.A budget cut would impact the support of the application and the purchasing of the licenses required to allow all the Reclamation users to connect to the CARMA application.  Database services and centralized application support could be affected depending on where the cuts would need to occur.  There are two dedicated contract support personnel and their services could be diminished resulting in slower response time to the users of the application.","Prior year references investment accomplishments in 2011, however, 2010 is the first submission of the stand alone Reclamation CARMA IT Investment.

010-999990393,10,Department of the Interior,0,Department of the Interior,"The DOI HRLOB Shared Service Center (SSC) is one of six federal HRLOB SSCs selected by OPM to standardize and integrate HR processes throughout the Federal government. This standardization provides cost avoidance to DOI through economies of scale; it reduces/eliminates duplicate processes and streamlines HR processes. Most Exhibits show only IT project costs, but HRLOB shows all LOB costs, to meet OPM requirements. To fulfill OPM commitments, NBC, on behalf of DOI, continues to expand its current services by delivering a standardized, integrated HR Information System that supports the strategic management of human capital. FPPS provides OPM's three core HR services (Compensation Management, Benefits Management, and BRM activities resulting in a Personnel Action) to more than 42 federal agencies. NBC also offers a modern data warehouse for purposes of reports and data analysis. NBC has enhanced its FPPS services by expanding its non-core systems offerings that includes an integration framework enabling real-time interoperability between FPPS and other systems: Entrance On Duty (EODS); Talent Management (TMS); Workforce Transformation and Tracking (WTTS), and Electronic Official Personnel File (eOPF). WTTS and EODS are integrated real time with FPPS and with automated staffing systems (Monster Government Solution's Enterprise Hiring Manager (EHM) and OPM's USA Staffing (USAS)). NBC offers customers EHM and USAS licensing discounts. (Some customers receive a discount of more than 50% of what they could attain on their own.) HRLOB directly supports DOI's Strategic Human Capital Management Plan. Consolidation of DOI HR services provides cost avoidance and econonomies of scale, keeping DOI's W-2 costs steady (FY12 costs close to 1997 levels!) In 2012, NBC will continue to keep costs steady and increase its customer base (as agencies grow, more employees use the services provided by NBC) and will provide additional services to current clients and/or migrate new agencies.","OPM defined a business need of standardization and centralization of HR processes.  Historically, the federal government has taken an &quot;agency-centric&quot; approach to delivering HR services.  While agencies should maintain control of some HR practices, it also makes sense that &quot;transactional&quot; processes could be taken out of the agency, freeing up resources to do more valuable strategic HR work and mission-related functions.  The DOI HRLOB Shared Service Center provides that service for DOI and over 42 other federal agencies.  The HR Line of Business initiative has the following characteristics: 1). Citizen-Centered: Free agency HR personnel to do valuable, strategic work of building a federal workforce that includes more employees in customer service delivery roles and cultivating a citizen-centric culture; 2). Results-Oriented:  Identify outcomes and establish performance measures and track processes to ensure desired results are achieved.  When not received, corrective actions will be taken.  3). Market-based:  The shared service center approach is designed to encourage competion amoung providers, in turn, this results in improved quality, efficiency and customer satisfaction.The DOI HRLOB Shared Service Center provides the automated systems and standardizations for clients to achieve cost savings, cost avoidance, economiies of scale pricing, and reduction or elimination of duplicate processes, allowing the agency to focus on mission-critical activities.","HRLOB implementations- FY11: one  to Quicktime, one to WTTS/EODS, one to webTA, and one anticipated to TMS. - Three production releases in April, August, December.- W-2 rates for FY11 were less than those paid by clients in 1997, but with 340% more functionality!  - Licensing discounts for Monster Government Solution's Enterise Hiring Manager (EHM) and OPM's USA Staffing (USAS) resulted in savings  of $1.3M for DOI and $3.3M for other federal agencies.

Security risk-based decisions, procedures and network architecture force inter bureau traffic through slower remote network connections, instead of allowing traffic to flow directly over the fastest possible route, which limits network performance and our ability to share data. The purpose of this project is to develop plans to optimize the Enterprise Services Network (ESN) by increasing network performance and reducing management complexity. Additionally these plans will help optimize enterprise network security by reducing redundancy, consolidating operational efforts and enhancing network security. The Bureau/Offices will be enabled to consolidate telecommunication data circuits to reduce circuit costs and encourage sharing of local computer assets between bureaus. The project will reduce the total cost of ownership for this IT infrastructure asset which supports the various missions within the Department of the Interior. Functional group satisfaction will be increased as the ESN is realign to support the network security posture with various functions with common network security requirements rather than the current bureau based alignment.The Telecommunication Services provides a broad range of communication support technologies to the DOI community.

010-000000094,10,Department of the Interior,4,Bureau of Land Management,"Collections and Billings System (CBS) is an automated system that was implemented in FY 2000 to provide BLM managers and staff with accurate and timely information on collections and receipts. The funds that used to be accounted for manually are now put under accounting control at the time of receipt providing a complete, detailed audit trail.  CBS has fully automated hundreds of manual or partially automated labor-intensive processes in the field saving BLM over $4.6 million in FY 2010.  CBS has helped BLM to obtain unqualified audit opinions by providing accountability of funds, security of information, separation of duties, and audit trails of all transactions. CBS  design is user and business driven with easily adaptive functionality.BLM management routinely uses CBS  reports to make business decisions related to planning, process and systems analysis, cost determination, and risk assessments. CBS has improved BLMs ability to quickly respond to financial legislation and reporting requirements, while adding payment options (cash, credit card, or check) for customers.CBS continues to make enhancements with each new FBMS deployment and interface with additional resource systems as required. CBS has an interdependent relationship with FBMS, Pay.gov, Vantiv Bank, and BLM land resource systems, including Lease and Realty Authorization Module (LRAM), Rangeland Administration System (RAS), Recreation Management Information System (RMIS), Automated Inventory Management System (AIMS), Alaska Land Information System (ALIS), Mining Claims Adjudication (MCII), Legacy Rehost 2000 (LR2K), Paria Canyon Wilderness Permit System (Paria), Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Permit System (Aravaipa), and Lower Deschutes River Permit System (Boater Pass).  BPS was designed to track the budget planning cycle more efficiently from the identification of needs and opportunities through project identification and the final budget approval.   The system serves as the primary source used by BLM s Budget Office and Washington Office program staffs to prepare budget and performance planning documents to be used across BLM. After FBMS deployment, 3 MIS subsystems (Performance &amp; Workload Measures System, Automated Inventory Management System (AIMS), and Leasing) continued to operate fully.  The other MIS subsystems are maintained due to the seven year requirement for the preservation and retrieval of historic data.","CBS has accelerated the availability of funds to BLM and the Treasury and eliminated duplicate data entry. Before implementation, the average time for a payment collected in a field office to be deposited in the bank was two weeks. Receipts were manually entered at the field office, mailed to the Business Services Division and input into FFS, now FBMS, and other resource systems. Now, data is input by the field office and transmitted electronically to FBMS and the appropriate resource system by the next day. It provides a complete automated billing process that allows the field offices to track different bill types (Accounts Receivable, Advance Bills, and Courtesy Statements) and generate timely demand letters, thus eliminating the need for the field to keep cuff records. Now the actions that could be billed under the different bill types are standardized.  The powerful reporting capabilities of CBS provide management (WO, NOC, SOs and FOs) with critical information (collections deposited, unpaid bills, and specific program collections) for easy analysis and quick action. Whereas, the major reports from various accounting systems are only generated for the field on a monthly basis and at a higher level. CBS has tightened security at all levels through role-based access and separation of duties.  CBS has directly contributed to fraud detection/prevention across the organization through traceability of funds that was not possible through the manual/paper process. It has also become a valuable source of information during fraud related investigations.  With program specific automatic late fees, BLM can track and apply late fees more accurately, thereby enforcing policy in this area.Some of CBS  interfaces/accounts provide the general public with easy options to purchase certain BLM products over the internet, by phone, or mail with guaranteed payments by credit card. BLM users can easily process these transactions through CBS to generate the receipts and financial information for FBMS.  In 2011, 98.51 percent of transaction data was available to all users bureau-wide within 24 hours.  Prior to CBS, financial data was not available for weeks.If the project is not fully funded, the BLM Business Services Division would cease all new development, O&amp;M changes would be limited, and the ability to meet the requirements of new Congressional legislation and the FBMS D7 blueprinting would be difficult.","This year, the following accomplishments were made to systems under the CBS umbrella: Moved CBS development, training, test and production to new Sun T5240 server hardware.  We also upgraded to  version 11.5 of Informix, Converted CBS reports from Brio 6 to Hyperion 9, Moved the PMDS to new Sun T5240 server hardware, converted the frontend to version 9.01 of ColdFusion and converted PMDS reports from Brio 6 to Hyperion 9, Moved the AIMS to new Sun T5240 hardware, converted the frontend to version 9.01 of ColdFusion and converted AIMS reports from Brio 6 to Hyperion 9, Converted BPS to new Sun T5240 server hardware, converted the frontend to version 9.01 of ColdFusion and converted BPS reports from Brio 6 to Hyperion 9, Decommissioned the old CBS Sun E10K server hardware, Interfaced CBS with FBMS D6 deployment, Completed the TSIS Functional Requirements and began working on the TSIS Technical design.","Plans for the following FY 2012 and FY 2013: Continue operations and maintenance, Complete the TSIS interface, Complete the AFMSS interface, Create an interface to Treasury s TRS system, Create an interface to Treasury s Paper Check Conversion, Reactivate the ALIS interface with Alaska, Create a Payment Portal for paying CBS and other bills on-line, Continue to modify CBS for each FBMS deployment, Analyze alternatives to the Prolifics/Panther frontend source code.Based on the FY 2010 Operational Analysis of CBS, our recommendation is to continue with development, operations and maintenance activities.  This system is deemed critical and a business essential system of the BLM, and will continue to annually process hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions, even with the deployment of the FBMS.

010-000000292,10,Department of the Interior,10,Bureau of Reclamation,"This investment is  justified and in line with Interior s proud history of providing critical and essential water services to the American public.  It directly supports the efficient delivery of water and power services to millions across the Pacific-NorthWest.  It also supports multiple organizational GPRA goals, including the effieient delivery of water and power services, the sustained delivery of water and power services (no or limited service disruptions), and the efficient delivery of  critical infrastructure and recreational services to communities.  This investment contributes to  other corollary goals associated with maintaining wildlife and biological species.          The Grand Coulee Power Office (GCPO) (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) SCADA system is based on a legacy-architecture (mainframe-based) SCADA system with a central, redundantly-configured master station communicating with numerous remotely-located plant control/interface/termination units in a hierarchical control scheme. This system has been in place, though upgraded, over 20+ years.  It enables personnel to monitor conditions and operationally control events at two of the major dams and power plants in the Pacific Northwest (PN) Region of the United States. These two facilities, Grand Coulee and Hungry Horse, provide flood control, irrigation, hydropower production, recreation, and navigation benefits to a wide cross-section of commercial, industrial and governmental organizations and users. The GCPO SCADA also supports, through communications links to a partner agency (the Bonneville Power Association), limited control of the hydropower production capabilities at both Grand Coulee and Hungry Horse.  Failure of the system would result in the loss of the ability of the Grand Coulee Project to  do the following: accomplish load following and regulation, operate to optimize efficiency, and effectively control voltage in the 500kV and 230kV switchyards.  At present, well over 12 million water and power consumers are provided services by these legacy systems. For these reasons, it is imperative that the system remain operational and that the replacement system project be completed by no later than 2015.  A delay could jeopardize water and power services to the Pacific Northwest.","By volume, the Columbia is the fourth-largest river in the U.S., and it has the greatest flow of any North American river draining into the Pacific Ocean. The Grand Coulee Dam is foundational to the Columbia River Power System. It provides water storage, flood control, power and recreational opportunities. This directly supports the mission of Reclamation to manage, develop, and protect water and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner in the interest of the American public. The SCADA system being replaced provides an automated means to accomplish these mission objectives.The USBR conducted several extensive alternatives analysis for a replacement to the existing SCADA system investment that has been in operation for approximately 20 years.  These were accomplished in 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2008.  In 2006, the USBR issued an RFP inclusive of a technical specification to which there were two credible responses.  In 2008, a previously rejected alternative and an existing US Government investment (via BPA and USACE) was revisited and chosen to be the best option.  This option was a COTS-based GOTS  product  from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) called GDACS, Generic Data Acquisition and Control System. Appropriated funds are not requested; however, without BPA funding, there would be a potential for the following events -   a) The SCADA system would eventually fail making it impossible to provide water and power services at current levels leaving millions w/out water and/or power in the Pacific Northwest. b)  Operating the facilities would become a more labor intensive undertaking due to the unit control boards being located adjacent to the generators and pumps. This would increase operating costs substantially. c)  Hiring, training, and certifying enough personnel to control the facilities 24x7x365, allowing for sufficient spare personnel for absenteeism, would be required to ensure  the ability to respond to BPA generation requirements.  The additional staffing requirement would be in excess of $4M per year, and loss of automatic generation control due to running the system in manual mode would be estimated at an additional loss of approximately $500K per year.",GDACS: - Completed 9 RTU Commissionings.- Completed ~$1M in h/w &amp; s/w procurements.- Mapboard FAT &amp; SAT.- Installed final network hardware.- Network and software/hardware training.- DDS Alarm and Event app release.- RTU DDS app release.GCPO SCADA legacy system:- ongoing operations and maintenance of existing legacy system.- decommissing portions as GDACS segments are implemented.,GDACS (CY): - Return 15 RTUs to Operations.- Right Powerhouse under GDACS control.GDACS (BY): - Deliver GDACS with Switchyard control functionality.- Return 3 RTUs to Operations.- Return first of three Grand Coulee Switchyards to Operations.- Third Powerplant under GDACS control.GCPO SCADA legacy system (BY and CY):- ongoing operations and maintenance of existing legacy system.- decommissing portions as GDACS segments are implemented.,32.86,9.519181,9.218724,8.097602,2003.0,2021.0,BY12 passback submission: No changes were made to the BY12 submission from September 2010.

FFS is a mainframe system; some of that technology is becoming outdated, and more modern systems are being developed and maintained with different technology. FFS is no longer supported by the software vendor and is nearing the end of its useful life.  FFS cannot be easily modernized to meet any new changes mandated by laws and regulations. Interior must replace FFS with a system that complies with a contemporary open system architecture environment. Further, the existing system does not take advantage of new technology and is not integrated in a manner that facilitates effective and efficient transfer of data and streamlining of processes necessary to support the Department in the future.  Moreover, the 2011 FFS Operational Analysis indicated that FFS would require improvements in 9 functional areas if FFS were not being replaced by the Financial and Business Management System (FBMS).The Department plans to replace FFS and other related financial systems through the Financial and Business Management System (FBMS) Project.

Funds will be used for software license, hosting and government and contractor labor to support the system and its users. The Department of the Interior and two external clients fund the operation of this system through reimbursable inter-agency agreements. Funding for this project supports the contractor and federal functional and technical support staff, software licenses, hardware, and hosting for the system.  The NBC's CFS O&amp;M costs are fully funded by clients, and costs are shared accordingly.DESCRIPTION OF MISSION DELIVERY, MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AREAS, AND PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF INVESTMENT: DOI is required to report its financial position through consolidated financial statements issued to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  An independent auditing firm conducts the annual audit of the financial statements. These audited financial statements and notes become an integral part of the Department's Accountability Report.  Also, the Department annually submits data to the Treasury Department via the FACTS I reporting process.  The DOI Office of Financial Management has the primary responsibility for meeting this reporting requirement, and the Department and its bureaus rely heavily on CFS to prepare their financial statements.  CFS meets the Department's requirements for financial statement preparation and FACTS I reporting.The Department expects to use CFS for financial statement preparation and FACTS I reporting until the last bureau migrates to FBMS, at which time CFS will be retired.  The retirement of CFS is planned to take place at the end of calendar year 2013 (FY14 1st Quarter end).","The DOI is required to report its financial position through consolidated financial statements issued to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

RMSS is the foundation for Reclamation mission-related WRM focused work functions that compute, store, access, maintain, and back up user-generated, mission-specific data for a wide range of functional activities related to water and hydroelectric power management objectives, including planning, environmental programs, and administrative functions. To accomplish these WRM goals and objectives, Reclamation personnel need ready access to both current and historical data. They must analyze and summarize data, complete essential operational activities, as well as prepare reports and presentations which provide meaningful information to citizens, business partners, and other government entities. To achieve these ends, the work force relies upon the capabilities of modern IT. RMSS is the WRM tailored IT system and IT operations personnel that support the secure, reliable data repositories, data analysis, reporting capabilities, transactions, and collaborative tools for Reclamation personnel to perform their work. RMSS also provides a secure network perimeter that protects water management automation tools and services so that authorized individuals can perform Reclamations' business functions and work activities to successfully carry out the mission.","RMSS serves as the primary provider of data storage, security, support and transport technology support services for Reclamation Water Resources Management (WRM) business / operational processes and functions.    Specific Water &amp; Hydropower deliver requirements for Reclamation's WRM applications and systems are all being successfully met in large part due to this investment.  If not fully funded, Reclamation's WRM applications and systems ability to meet Water &amp; Hydropower delivery requirements will also be adversely affected.","- During 2011 the Exhibit 53 Part 1 and Part 2 services contained within RMSS were identified to promote and accomplish realignment of common IT infrastructure services in support of the DOI IT Transformation effort.  - IT systems were operational at a bureau-wide level as required and available to users over 99.99% of the time, without interruption during business/non-business hours.  - SharePoint 2010 was installed and implemented for Reclamation.  Reclamation is also working with DOI to implement external SharePoint sites in the DOI extranet.  - Reclamation has also reduced the footprint of the Multiple Data Centers through virualization and consolidation of Regional resources as part of the Department's Consolidation efforts, resulting in power and cooling savings.

Operation and maintenance costs remain steady at approximately $1M dollars per year. Capital Planning Investment Control (CPIC) for this investment is accomplished through Reclamation's CIO Council and Investment Review Board processes. This Investment accomplishes Reclamation-wide budget analysis, formulation, and execution tracking in support of the President's budget as approved by Congress. PABS provides the ability to consolidate, analyze, and modify budgetary data within Regions and Area Offices as well as at the Bureau-wide level. PABS provides the Commissioner's Office with an automated tool for Funds Control management. PABS provides an interface to the accounting system, FFS, and allows for budget line item tracking/execution as it relates to BOR mission/goals. PABS plays a significant role in BOR's implementation of the Department of Interior's Activity Based Costing and Performance Management initiative.","PABS reduces costs of storing budget data in multiple systems, eliminates massive data reconciliation efforts, improves the timely availability of budget data for management decisions, and provides a secure tool for appropriated funds control.The impact of not receiving funding would result in the direction of the Director, Program and Budget to direct Reclamation Budget Officers to establish the manual PC- Based documents/spreadsheets. The Commissioner's Office Program and Budget staff will be responsible for maintaining manual PC-Based Program and Financing Table.  They will be responsible for manually recording changes to the Table reflecting reprogramming, fund transfers, and any other financial event that affects current year funding authority, or future year budget formulation for all projects and funding sources.  The PABS System Administrator will be responsible for coordination with the Finance and Accounting Division to accomplish the entry of these changes into the accounting system as required. (The budget authority would not be passed to the Federal Finance System (FFS) via the Interface.  Manual documents and vouchers would have to be created to be entered into FFS for all projects and funding sources).  Each Regional Budget Office will be responsible for manually recording changes to their Program Item records, and keeping data in balance with the P/F Table funding amounts.","PABS continued to be the main tool for budget formulation and supported the Reclamation-wide budget analysis, formulation, and execution in support of the President's Budget, as approved by Congress, and supported tracking of appropriated projects and other activities. PABS provided the ability to consolidate, analyze, and modify budgetary data with regions as well as at the bureau-wide level.

010-000000226,10,Department of the Interior,6,"Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement","BOEMRE designed and developed the Technical Information Management System (TIMS) to provide better data and assist managers in making strategic decisions regarding minerals resources on the Outer Continental Shelf.  The TIMS was designed to collect reporting requirements, analyze reports, and map information to provide management with the array of information necessary to carry out BOEMRE s mission.  The TIMS was built on an integrated corporate database which provides the foundation to all the applications.  Some of the many program areas supposed by TIMS include Lease Sale, Lease Adjudication, Environmental, Wells, Platform, Plans, and Pipelines.The OCS Connect investment was officially terminated December 31, 2010.  The OCS Connect deployed functionalities, Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) and Notice of Sale (NOS), were integrated into TIMS effective January 1, 2011.  Effective October 1, 2011, BOEMRE will be divided into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).  TIMS will continue to support both bureaus in the reorganization.The current DME work in TIMS allows leveraging a modernized TIMS as a foundation rather than replacing the entire mission application system, which will result in a system that can be built upon with new components as BOEMRE is divided into BOEM and BSEE.  Upgrading the infrastructure will ease and reduce maintenance work, address security requirements, leverage common architecture, and reduce costs.  Additonal DME funding is requested in BY 2013 for the eInspections initiative which gives inspectors immediate access to tools needed such as on-line policy manuals as well as eliminate dupication of efforts by elimination the office data entry of paper inspection forms.  The NOS system, deployed in 2009, integrates portal and digital document technologies and facilitates records management.  NOS is used to respond to data calls.  The system also facilitates preparing, reviewing, and disseminating various draft and final documents associated with planned lease sales through a workflow environment. The implementation of an EDMS in October 2010 is increasing the volume of documents that both BOEM and BSEE employees can access electronically during an emergency evacuation.  In 2009, 100 gigabytes of documents could be accessed electronically during an evacuation.  That number is expected to increase to 900 gigabytes by 2013.","The TIMS DME processes will positively impact BOEMRE s mission by decreasing cycle time and enhancing decision-making capabilities in high profile business process areas that make up the core of agency approvals.  The DME processes will also improve information quality and accessibility, which will increase employee productivity.   This is important as BOEMRE s mission evolves and workloads increase.  Specific changes to TIMS that will help mitigate resource constraints and contribute to these improvements are: Electronic information exchange  Ability to execute simultaneous reviews Improved cross-functional coordination and workflow tracking  Automated time-intensive records checks Automated certification validation, which eliminates paper-intensive processes Quicker reporting Enhanced data integrity and quality Increased information accuracy and consistency More timely and complete private sector information submittals Improved specifications for the regulated community Centralized provision of information for operatorsThe DME processes directly supports streamlining processes and reduces layers between citizens/customers and decision-makers.  By automating, streamlining, and converting paper-based processes to online applications, BOEMRE will increase the ability of existing staff to handle increased workload or allow existing staff to perform additional activities.  The improvements to TIMS will directly support eGovernment.  If fully funded, the updated TIMS will increase access to information, provide more transparent processes, and improve public awareness of OCS activities and understanding of BOEMRE s mission.  When deployed, the DME processes will provide a single point of access (via an Internet portal) for attaining data.  It will also facilitate information sharing and reduce redundancies by using a standard data model, exchange schemas, and business rules for online applications.  The DME processes will also ensure equity in accessing services by complying with Section 508.If full-funding is not received for TIMS, BOEMRE will have to cease development before work is complete, and the full benefits of the work done to date will not be realized.  Stopping work will leave portions of BOEMRE dependent on current error-prone and time consuming paper processes.  Maintenance costs on TIMS will also continue to rise.","The 6 month eInspection pilot started in March 2011.  The pilot goal is to conduct inspections and capture data more quickly.  BOEMRE would like to reduce inspection time and data capture time from 6 weeks to 2 days.  The offshore inspectors will benefit by using a system that will allow them to download information and forms into a rugged tablet PC to conduct inspections, record results, and then upload data into TIMS upon their return to shore.  This eliminates the paper process and human data entry.  The Gulf of Mexico inspections team, which conducts approximately 1,320 rig inspections and 3,800 facility inspections each year, estimates an eventual potential savings of 13,500 man-hours per year.In May 2011, the TIMS National Consolidated Information System (NCIS) was deployed.  NCIS leverages the existing TIMS oil, gas, and renewable energy information and serves as a single repository for all the offshore regions.","Deployment of the Electronic Information Collection/Integration (EIC) processes in May 2012 will have both external and internal benefits to BOEM.  The EIC processes include: New Company Qualifications  Change of Name Qualified Company Merger   Initial Bond Submittal Bond Rider Submittal  Replacement Bond Submittal  Bond Termination.Externally, EIC will positively impact approximately 65 oil and gas companies with multiple users at each company.  It will allow companies to submit forms, reports, and data electronically, thus eliminating paper submissions and decreasing the approval / review cycle time.  Data quality will improve by automating workflow and applying business rules and data constraints prior to acceptance.  Data quality will also improve by eliminating the human error associated with multiple data input.  Once implemented, BOEM will be able to receive many oil and gas industry submissions electronically.Internally, electronic submission by customers will eliminate some of the daily data entry required of BOEM staff.  Currently, all data is manually entered into a database by government personnel, which delays the review process and can result in data errors.  Automated workflow will increase efficiency by reducing cycle times for approval and review processes.  Automatic notification, change tracking, simultaneous reviews, enhanced consistency, and reduced errors will ensure more timely completion of projects.Upgrading the Geographic Information System (GIS) software in 2012 will provide the latest GIS functionality to help BOEM and BSEE analyze and evaluate plans, pipelines, permits, and leases.  It will also provide quick basemapping functionality to generate maps.  The upgrade will provide real time generation and access to spatial data for the users, which will assist them to make faster decisions and decrease their wait time.  The upgrade will impact the lease development process from the pre sale system to awarding a lease and publishing the lease diagrams.  The functionality gained from the upgrade will include developing and maintaining the offshore cadastre infrastructure, protractions, and blocks.",36.222,15.18,11.75,11.249,2001.0,2021.0,"TIMS increases are due to the termination of the OCS Connect investement effective 12/31/2010.

010-000000316,10,Department of the Interior,0,Department of the Interior,"Interior's goal with FBMS is to achieve and maintain the objectives of the government-wide CFO Council as stated in OMB Circular No. A-127: to establish a single, integrated financial management system. In pursuing this goal, Interior is following the information technology investment management practices and principles identified in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.FBMS, DOI's major financial management improvement effort, is an operational, integrated suite of software applications that enables Interior to manage a variety of business functions including: core financials, acquisitions, personal property, fleet management, real property, travel, financial assistance and enterprise management information and reporting.Interior's goal is to continue improvements in financial transaction processing, analysis, and reporting and to enhance financial management systems support through an effective partnership of program, information system, and financial managers. Interior relies on financial management systems planned for, managed together, and operated collectively to support program and financial managers.Traditionally the Department's financial management systems architecture has included many systems managed at the bureau level, some managed at the departmental level, and some that are government-wide systems on which the Department relies. The Department has viewed the movement toward a single, integrated financial system architecture as encompassing four interrelated elements that drive business process, improvements, and financial integrity. They are:(1) improvement of internal controls;(2) elimination of redundant data entry;(3) enabling end-to-end transaction processing; and(4) standardization of data for improved information quality and transparencyIn early FY 2012, Interior will implement the sixth of eight FBMS deployments that will facilitate the Department's business transformation. With each deployment, Interior enhances the capabilities of FBMS and gets closer to meeting the following goals across all of its bureaus:- Standardized and integrated processes;- Improved security and internal controls;- Improved cost information;- Improved tracking and auditing capabilities;- Reduced double entry of data in multiple systems and manual paper processing;- Improved Department-wide and bureau- specific reporting capabilities;- Increased data integrity; and- Retirement of aging and unsupported legacy system.","Gaps and Requirements:The FBMS project includes over 7000 Functional requirements and over a hundred Technical and Security requirements, plus Internal Controls requirements. The FBMS system is being implemented through eight deployments, with the above mentioned requirements of the system being gradually fulfilled and thus expanding functionality, and more DOI bureaus being added during each progressive deployment. This phased approach decreases risk and maximizes return.During the blueprinting process for each deployment, any new gaps in the solution for the bureau are identified and requirements are deferred or scope expanded to address these gaps. These changes to scope are handled through a formal change control process.The approach to requirements management on FBMS is to create end-to-end traceability between requirements and the related artifacts and documentation that support the design, configuration, development and testing of these requirements. The traceability strategy ensures that requirements drive the project and that requirements are directly traceable to test cases and to solutions and work products.Requirements management activities occur throughout the Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC). These activities facilitate having the correct requirements implemented at the correct time, and the product created satisfies the requirement. The SDLC methodology used on this project is Ascendant SAP.Assessment of the program impact if this investment isn't fully funded:Already deployed bureaus: OSM, BOEM, BSEE, BLM and USGS.D6 (Nov 2011) will deploy FWS and OS.D7 (Nov 2012) will deploy NPS and BIA.D8 (Nov 2013) will deploy BOR. The BY13 request is already $4.6 million less than FY12 funding. Operations and maintenance for FBMS constitute $33.8 of total spending; in the interest of sustaining operations for the already-deployed bureaus, any reductions beyond the current BY13 planning level would impact final go-live preparations for IA and NPS and development work for BOR. In order to support a successful go-live at IA and NPS, FBMS may need to delay deployment to BOR by an additional year. Thus, BOR would incur additional unplanned costs to maintain legacy systems operations for an additional year. Also, a major risk in delaying BOR's deployment a year is the loss of critical contract personnel (supplied by the system integrator and the PMO support vendor) and key Federal personnel.","In FY11 FBMS went live 11/2010 with D5, which included new Real Property functionality and new USGS bureau users.

Customers include the City of Grand Junction &amp; water districts in WY, UT, CO, and AZ.","The stated funding is required in order to meet the minimum requirements associated with  providing necessary services to the Department of Energy for their commitments to power customers and federal regulations, also this level of funding is required to meet the contracted obligations Reclamation  has to water users, as well as to meet both DOI FISMA and  NERC requirements. A reduction in the budget would make maintenance more difficult.  More time would be dedicated to addressing failures rather than preventing failures with long term planning and on-going development. A budget reduction would cause increased risk to the ability to maintain drawings and documentation making it difficult for future trouble shooting.  Budget reductions could significantly increase risk to system obsolescence, unscheduled costs increase due to emergency repairs, failure to meet security milestones, inability to assure appropriate staff training to meet operational needs and requirements. Funding for procurement, operation and maintenance is provided from revenues deposited in the Colorado River Basin Fund. Reclamation's budget includes appropriations language to reclassify certain receipts collected by Department of Energy's Western Area Power Authority (WAPA).   Each year, WAPA deposits amounts sufficient to pay operation and maintenance costs associated with the power functions of Reclamation facilities that generate the power sold by WAPA. This funding, deposited in the Colorado River Basin Fund, provides for operation and maintenance costs associated with CRSP SCADA and is not available for other purposes.   All funding for this Investment is from non-appropriated funds.","In the Previous Year (PY) 2011,  the CRSP SCADA system:   1) provided automated control of water delivery and power production for the Colorado River Storage Project from a centralized location,  2)  remained available for 99.9 % of the time,  3) was used to manage the allocations of water delivery, 4) provided for the use of functions such as AGC (Automatic Generating Control) in conjunction with the Department of Energy using real-time data transfer and  AVC (Automatic Voltage Control) and MBC (MegaVAR Balance Control) to help stabilize the western electric grid that would not be available without automation, 5) was used to  provided water data automatically for the Water Resources Group which is the caretaker of the CRSP water data for water management decisions and historical records, and 6) was used to provide information regarding the  hydroelectric power generated within the CRSP projects.","In the Current Year (CY) 2012, in addition to the accomplishments as given in the PY, the CRSP SCADA system will also include the use of a test environment which is to be used to increase reliability of the system by testing changes or requirements on the test system prior to installing them on the production system, and refine the processes and procedures that are necessary to  comply with regulatory requirements.

The mission of the NBC FMLoB is to offer comprehensive and cost effective financial and business management solutions to non-DOI federal agencies.   We accomplish this mission by delivering two core financial systems, CGI-Federal Momentum Financials &amp; Oracle Federal Financials.  The NBC provides a full spectrum of services related to federal financial management, including hosting, application management, functional and technical support, conversion, implementation, quality assurance, interface and report development, project management, helpdesk support, audit support, security and training.  The NBC FMLoB services and staff of federal financial management and information technology experts help our customer agencies meet federal financial management mandates, particularly FFMIA, FMFIA and A-123.  Customer agencies benefit from these services and by sharing in costs with other customers.   In addition to helping customers meet their financial management processing needs and federal requirements, the NBC FMLoB offers related value-added services such as eTravel, procurement, asset management and data warehousing, augmenting the benefits of using the NBC as a shared service provider. This investment is not dependent upon other investments reported by the Department of the Interior.","As the federal deficit increases and agency appropriations decrease, federal agencies are increasingly in need of a cost-effective and well-performing solution to meet their federal financial management needs.   Since the inception of the NBC FMLoB, our customers have benefited  from the NBC's federal financial management expertise and economies of scale by sharing licensing, hosting, functional and technical support, security and audit costs with other NBC customers.  Many of our Oracle Federal Financials and Momentum Financial customers are small federal agencies with limited staff possessing financial management and/or information technology expertise and even more limited funding.  These agencies simply do not have the resources to house a data center and maintain an IT system operations and accounting staff.  By subscribing to the NBC FMLoB's comprehensive financial management services, our customers  can focus on their agency missions because their financial management needs are taken care of by the NBC.  In this way, the NBC FMLOB program helps to close the gap in keeping financial management systems costs low and while assuring federal agency compliance with mandates for federal financial management practices.","In FY2011, the NBC FMLoB:1.  completed implementation of the 1 new Oracle Federal Financials (OFF) client acquired in FY10 (new customers in prior years: FY2010: 1 FY09: 0, FY08: 2, FY07: 3 FY06: 3);2.  completed migration of the final non-DOI FFS customer to Momentum Financials (go-live October 1, 2010); 3.  executed comprehensive customer service initiatives; 4.  met or exceeded all quarterly performance metrics targets; 5.  continued project activities for Oracle Federal Financials R12 upgrade; activities include implementing sub-ledger accounting; 6.  moved remaining OFF customer from a standalone environment to the NBC OFF shared instance; and7.  made a business decision to terminate the Momentum Financials product line by December 31, 2012.","Current Year (CY2012) planned accomplishments:1.  upgrade to Oracle Federal Financials (OFF) version R12 in Feb 2012;2.  move OFF to the Interior Franchise Fund;3.  focus on improved operational efficiencies and reduced costs;4.  terminate Momentum Financials product line, assisting remaining Momentum customers in transitioning to their new shared service provider;5.  implement a new NBC customer on OFF6.  migrate a current NBC Momentum customer to OFF.Budget Year (BY2013) planned accomplishments:1.  complete termination of Momentum Financials, finalizing customer departures and system shutdown; 2.  implement government mandate &quot;Do Not Pay&quot;;3.  implement government mandate &quot;Internet Payment Platform&quot;;4.  implement interface to the new eTravel 2 system (GSA's selection of new eTravel system planned for 2012).",145.068,28.0304,28.0,14.2,2004.0,2020.0,"Funding levels have changed to account for a shift in customer base for the federal agencies using NBC FMLoB shared financial management services.

The primary goal is to deliver project benefits in a safe, reliable, and efficient manner. CVACS is comprised of a large, distributed network of sensors and automation equipment embedded in dams, power plants, pumping plants and control centers, providing real-time generation, reservoir and river status information and remote control of power generation and water releases. In the statutes authorizing the construction, operation and maintenance of the various divisions of the Central Valley Project between 1937 and 1965, Congress has consistently included language directing the Secretary to operate the Central Valley Project as a single, integrated project. CVACS is a key asset for decision-makers who manage limited natural water resources in the CVP to provide flood control, water deliveries and hydropower generation while meeting Central Valley Project Improvement Act requirements, the Endangered Species Act, Biological Opinions, CALFED objectives, and water rights decision (D-1641) for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta).BOR-CVODSS (Central Valley Operations Decision Support System) - CVACS collects real-time water and power operations data that is transferred to a historical archive database containing 64 years of CVP operations data.  Increasing internal and external demand for the real-time water and power operations information, had to be balanced with requirements to secure access to CVACS.  The historical archive database application, a component of the Central Valley Operations Decision Support System (CVODSS), enables access to CVP operations information and minimizes access to more critical systems.

The systems contain abstract information from approximately 6 million land and mineral cases. LR2000 provides more than 59,907 reports per month to the public and 8,789 standard reports and 2,608 Ad Hoc reports per month to internal land managers.  LR2000 supports the DOI mission by providing records of the extent of the Nation s land and mineral ownership and by maintaining records on use authorizations for the Nation s natural resources.  LR2000 supports the Energy Act by providing automated support for business processes associated with the issuance of oil and gas production leases on BLM lands.Legacy systems re-hosted into the LR2000 System identified below provide for the storage, retrieval and dissemination of abstracted case information describing the right, title and interest of a parcel:Case Recordation (CR) - data for land and mineral, title, use authorization, and withdrawal cases. Legal Land Description (LLD) - describes land in accordance with a cadastral or special survey.Mining Claim Recordation System (MCRS) - contains 3 million plus cases and records of lode and placer mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites located on public lands.Status (ST) - historic data pertaining to title cases that transferred surface and/or mineral rights to or from the U.S., including any restrictions on U.S. rights.Cadastral Survey Field Note Indexing System (CS) - on-line index to the survey field note records maintained throughout the BLM.

Serial Number Automation Module (SNAM) - user generated (single or block) serial numbers for Case Recordation or Mining Claim Recordation.","LR2000 manages approximately 6 million BLM land and mineral cases. It is the system utilized in the adjudication of mining claims and oil and gas leases, and the majority of respondents to internal surveys say that they cannot properly do their jobs if LR2000 is not accessible.  The results of internal surveys indicate a highly reliable, user friendly and accurate system that meets the business requirements of the user community. For internal customers, over 1,400 BLM employees have access to add/update cases daily in LR2000 transaction applications. On average 45,425 new cases are added annually and approximately 835,089 cases are modified. An average of 105,458 internal reports are run against the reporting database and 989,567 reports are run against the transaction database yearly. Approximately 31,299 AdHoc reports are run. For external customers, over 145,760 customers used the public report site and over 718,878 public reports were run in FY09. When asked what kind of data was most useful, &quot;All of it&quot; was a readily given response by many respondents. Respondents state that LR2000 is a great system and they are extremely pleased with it overall.  Respondents also praised the customer service and timely feedback provided by LR2000 User Representatives and would not change the way things are now handled.LR2000 continues to be essential to the BLM's land title and land and minerals business programs/process and for BLM's Energy Act implementation. If full funding is not received, operations and maintenance would not be able to continue at the same level of support. Fewer tickets would be resolved due to the decrease in O&amp;M funding and user support could be impacted if the BLM were unable to fund increases in rates for contractor support due to inflation. The system should continue operation, including normal maintenance and approved fixes, until replaced.  The determination of any necessary minor enhancements will be performed as new regulations or requirements are requested.  Further enhancements may also be needed to meet the requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005; this analysis is ongoing (e.g., additions in FY 2009 for integration of USFS, ALIS, etc.).","PY Accomplishments: 1.

The system is currently deployed at and supporting all fee collecting operations at three parks (Sleeping Bear Dunes, Castillo de San Marcos, and Yosemite).  The system will be installed at 5-10 parks/year with a demonstrated business need from FY2013-FY2019, with parks with the highest revenues and adequate technical infrastructure given highest priority.","Before the POSS was implemented, not one single point of sale/fee collection device, system, or application on the NPS network was officially authorized through the FISMA-mandated Risk Management Framework (FRM) system-authorization process (formerly referred to as Certification and Accreditation), nor was one certified as compliant with the US Treasury-mandated Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards for protection of credit cardholder data.  POSS is currently undergoing the independent assessments required for both FISMA and PCI security compliance, and will provide the only technology for fee collection in the NPS that complies with IT security requirements. In addition, the POSS architecture allows that the fee collection data servers be centralized and virtualized in the existing NPS Denver Data Center, rather than requiring an on-site server or servers at each park.  This not only does not increase the number of servers and data centers required for NPS IT infrastructure,but for parks that replace a legacy system with POSS, is actually reduces the number of servers required at individual park sites, and thus supports the performance measure &quot;Percent Change in number of DOI data centers from FY 2010 base of 426 to 173&quot;.Other than the NPS Fee Analyst position, which serves as the program manager for the POSS system, this system is funded entirely through fee revenues, not through appropriated funds.  However, a significant reduction in the operations and maintenance budget for this system would make it impossible to install the system at additional park locations, and would make it difficult to support the three existing pilot parks; therefore, additional systems would need to be procured to replace POSS at the three pilot parks currently using the system.","System was in the process of being acquired and customized during the PY.  Acquisition accomplishments included:- Prime contract awarded with Quality Technologies 8/12/2009 for services through 8/11/2010.- Option Period 1 awarded with Quality Technologies for period of performance 8/15/2010 - 8/14/2011.- CLIN 0001 Centralized Point of Sale Database (CPOSD) installed and deployed on a virtualized server at the NPS Denver Data Center.- Customizations and configurations of the system to meet 90% of the functional requirements (defined in the POSS Functional Requirements Document) of the system were completed and accepted.- Deployment, installation, and training on system at pilot site Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE), 4/4/2010; Castillo de San Marcos National Monument (CASA), 5/4/2010; Yosemite National Park (YOSE), 5/30/2010.- Through 8/2011, system has been used to collect and process over $21.3 M in fee revenue from park visitors at the 3 pilot sites.","- Project completed DOI Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) 10/2010 and participated in iStat review 5/2011. As a result, because of identified quality deficiencies in the processes of the prime contractor resulting in numerous rejected deliverables, and because of identified managerial shortcomings with the prime contractor, resulting in numerous missed and/or rescheduled deliverables, NPS made the decision to not exercise Option 2 of the prime contract. At the same time, NPS made the decision to retain the system that was selected (as it was meeting all functional requirements and performing well); however, installations at additional parks were reduced to 5-10 per year, and the business requirements for use of the system were strengthened to ensure the maximum ROI.- As a result of the IBR and iStat processes, the prime contract with Quality Technologies will end 8/14/2011.  The NPS is in the process of executing a sole-source bridge contract (anticipated to be in place 9/2011) with the developer of the software to sustain and operate the existing production system (including operations and maintenance, software licensing, system administration, and help desk). - The NPS will release an RFP in FY2012 to continue with the scaled-down (non-Servicewide) installation of the software at high-revenue parks, provide and support off-the-shelf POS hardware, and subsume all operations, maintenance, and technical support of the system.

IMARS will provide a common capability across all participating functional areas for capturing and reporting law enforcement and security incident information and will be configured, tested, and deployed to over 6,000 users in FY12. IMARS will be deployed across all agencies and locations to addresses three principle threats:   National Security - Law enforcement officers (LEOs) and agents working in seven law enforcement programs distributed between five bureaus nationwide lack the tools to perform various law enforcement activities (information sharing and intelligence analysis of terrorism, drug cartels, etc.) which take place in the nations 1,672 sites and to protect 489 million visitors annually.  Because DOI has so many law enforcement responsibilities at so many sites across the country, it is continually collecting information on people and events.  Both actions and observations, criminal and non-criminal, may have security implications, and these need to be recorded, reported, shared and analyzed on multiple levels.   Public Safety - DOI, the nation s largest land-owner, has day-to-day law enforcement responsibilities on 500 million acres of lands that it owns and manages.  DOI has the responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate criminal activity that occurs on its lands.  DOI must manage safety and protection for the millions of visitors each year that use these lands, as well as for the thousands of DOI employees that manage the resources, including monitor visitor use, manage crowds/traffic, and protect natural and cultural resources.  These responsibilities require the collection, analysis, management and reporting of information.   Officer Safety - DOI LEOs, including corrections and investigations (appr. 6,500 ), are at a far greater risk due to a lack of information sharing on warrants and suspected individuals. IMARS access will allow officers (including tribal), agents, and dispatchers to access departmental and national databases from their immediate locations, thus significantly enhancing officer safety in the field.IMARS will conduct a Post Implementation Review in FY13 and track performance through Operational Analysis. The assumptions in the AA are still valid.  The investment is still in development therefore the QA plan will be updated after the first release in March.","Without IMARS, the DOI is unable to provide capability for capturing and reporting law enforcement (LE) and security incident information and to carry out its mission. Cancelling IMARS would leave over 6,000 users without a system or with antiquated systems for collecting/ reporting LE incident information in FY13. This creates cost disadvantages for participating bureaus and programs that are able to collect information in these systems would not be able to report, share, or analyze data as required.

Transition to full NIBRS reporting would be substantially delayed or rendered unachievable. Contract options could not be exercised and would require re-negotiation in future period with increased cost/budget requirements.Lack of funding will also reduce DOI's ability to share information with other LE agencies.

010-000001049,10,Department of the Interior,12,United States Geological Survey,"As part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) program of disseminating water data to the public, the USGS maintains a distributed network of computers and file servers for the acquisition, processing, review, storage and dissemination water data collected through its activities at more than 1.54 million sites around the country. This system is called the National Water Information System (NWIS). Data quickly and easily available from NWIS are essential to the implementation and successful completion of a broad range of interpretive studies addressing groundwater, surface-water, water-quality, and water-use issues that are critical to USGS partners in Local, State, Tribal, and Federal government as well as the international community.  For example, the hydrologic data stored and made available by NWIS are used not only for determining the adequacy of water supplies, but also for implementing flood-warning systems; designing dams, bridges, and flood control projects; allocating irrigation water; locating sources of pollution, planning for energy development; and investigating the contamination potential of water supplies due to natural and human influences.   - Water data acquired, quality assured and disseminated via NWIS remain critical to meeting the USGS mission and other Federal and State Agencies with water management.  - NWIS supports Open Government by providing timely information to the public and as a data-source to other USGS, government and commercial users.  - The NWIS web site contributes to the public's awareness of the importance of USGS streamgages and information. In 2010, the web site had over 500 million hits and a annual customer satisfaction rating of 95%.  - Data and information from NWIS are a key component of Data.gov.  - NWIS is the  authoritative source  for obtaining USGS water data   supporting USGS strategic science initiatives.  - NWIS contains data collected over the last 100+ years as well as real-time data both of which are online and easily available/accessible from one system via the web. Beneficiaries:Multiple Agencies - EPA, National Weather Service and their Weather Forecast Centers and River Forecast Centers - and other NOAA bureaus, US Army Corps of Engineers, DOE, USGS and other DOI bureaus.State, tribal, and local governments.Hundreds of partners in the Cooperative Water Program.Private sector consultants, engineers, and scientists.Schools, colleges, and universities.The public.","The NWIS is the water data system that supports the major USGS Water Programs and other critical DOI activities in the DOI 2011-2016 Strategic Plan  Mission Area  &quot;Provide a Scientific Foundation for Decision-making&quot; , Strategy #4: &quot;Monitor and assess water availability and quality.&quot;Water data and information readily available from NWIS supports the major USGS Water Programs and other DOI activities that are critical to both the Climate Change and the Water Conservation DOI Strategic Plan High Priority Goals, including the WaterSMART initiative. NWIS supports the DOI IRM Strategic Goal to Enable transparency and accessibility of information and services to the public.  Data made READILY AVAILABLE to the PUBLIC from the NWIS web site are critical to water managers and decision-makers.Maintenance improvements to NWIS will increase the amount and type of water data and related metadata available to customers, including more information about the quality of the data. Maintenance improvements made to the NWIS applications and interfaces to other agencies will increase customer satisfaction in the areas of ease, speed, and effectiveness of data access and data integration. If NWIS is not fully funded, funding reductions could impact operations of the real-time data infrastructure.  Without the maintenance improvements, current systems could become overwhelmed creating delays in providing delivery of real-time data.  During severe hydrologic events (like hurricanes and major floods), USGS might have to restrict/limit public access to real-time data to insure critical water managers have adequate accessibility. Funding reductions could delay future technology refreshes and the 2013 maintenance updates, some of which support the Science Strategies for Water Availability and Climate Change. The reduction could also impact the coordination and  integration of a potential COTS package that will improve the USGS time-series water data processing  critical to USGS Water Programs (like the National Streamflow Information Program). Without adequate planning and preparation for the smooth integration of the COTS (and retirement of older subsystems), USGS could lose its capability to meet new demands and efficiencies needed to maintain key State and Local Cooperators.","NWIS- Improved map-based interfaces for data input and output- Provided additional metadata and reporting capabilities to improve data quality (QA/QC) and data-integration- Improved  ability to store history of changes to key data- Improved web services to promote more efficient data mining and second-use potential, particularly by smart-phone apps.- Cleaned up legacy data-attributes and removed unused software functionality - Fixed over 300 reported software problems. - The pro-active monitoring and upgrades to NWISWeb system continue to handle record level usage and provide very high customer satisfaction. NWIS national operations of real-time data acquisition and delivery systems provide reliability and redundancy  with no loss/outage in availability.- NWIS continues participation and collaboration with USGS groups and other partners (NOAA, EPA, Consortium of Universities of Advancement of Hydrologic Science) in the area of web-services and data-sharing.","Operations and maintenance activities with the following highlights.Data Delivery (NWISWeb subsystems)  (Data Sharing and Integration) - NWISWeb continues improvements to data delivery by improving web services and increasing the amount and types of data available. - Continue collaboration and support in promoting NWIS web/data services as the feed to others in USGS and strategic partners - Improved site-identification services and water-data-catalog service will support more robust geospatial data-discovery services (cooperative work with other USGS Science Programs, CUAHSI, OGC, USEPA and NOAA). - Customer-driven improvements to NWISWeb public user-interface will be made to sustain high user satisfaction with focus on improving the on-line help system.Data Acquisition and Processing (core-NWIS field-center subsystems) - Continue to refresh field-center servers and move to the enterprise supported DBMS. - Improve regression testing and data-migration validation tools. - Continue improvements to NWIS applications and database interfaces using data-services to facilitate the use of more third-party software/COTS.

However costs and schedule data are reported monthly to the Bureau and Agency Investment Review Boards. NWIS Contracts currently used are fixed-price, government wide service/acquisition contracts, and task orders issued against existing contracts. Contracts for hardware and software purchases are established based on the life cycle of the system. For hardware and software purchases of commercially available (commodity) products and services, NWIS uses Department of Interior &quot;enterprise-wide&quot; contracts and the NASA SEWP-IV contract. Hardware and COTS support and maintenance services are aggregated within USGS for potential cost savings and full-competition, and are multi-year contracts to cover the software life cycle (SLC). Contracts for software technical consulting and development services are established as needs arise in the SLC. For current technical software development services, NWIS is using specific services and task orders on existing agency performance-based contracts. Using task orders for specific products and investigations gives NWIS flexibility in initiating and monitoring task-order projects. Each task-order project is lead by a technical member of the NWIS team who provides the written objective, goals and requirements of task. Except for compliance to business requirements and preferred Technical Reference Model (TRM) components, the task orders are structured so that contractors are free to investigate and provide multiple designs alternatives prior to beginning the implementation of the government-preferred design.",5,Security related risks are captured in POAMS.

010-000000987,10,Department of the Interior,12,United States Geological Survey,"The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) is the USGS initiative to broadly improve the monitoring and reporting of earthquakes in the U.S.  Begun in 2000, ANSS is modernizing and expanding capabilities nationally by establishing an integrated national system of 7100 sensors, providing data to national and regional centers. ANSS provides realtime information on the distribution and intensity of earthquake shaking to emergency responders so that they can rapidly assess the full impact of an earthquake and speed disaster relief to the most heavily affected areas. ANSS also provides engineers with the information they need to improve building design standards and engineering practices to mitigate the impact of earthquakes.ANSS reduces costs through avoided losses. Average annual earthquake losses in the U.S. are estimated to approach $6 billion per year. Losses are avoided by improved mitigation (a result of more accurate hazard assessments), improved emergency response (a result of more accurate, useful and timely information), and improved awareness and decision-making in both public and private sectors (a result of the availability of accurate, reliable, timely information).As detailed in a report of the National Academy, strongly supporting the full deployment of ANSS, the beneficiaries are diverse: the public benefits from improved earthquake safety and reduced losses; emergency responders, governments at all levels, and lifeline operators benefit from improved situational awareness following a damaging earthquake; and scientists, engineers and architects benefit from improved data and information about earthquakes and the ground- and structural motions they cause.The 2008 USGS Science Strategy Report calls for &quot;Full deployment of the [ANSS] to improve seismic monitoring of the Nation and the 26 U.S. urban areas at greatest risk from earthquakes.&quot; ANSS is also a top priority of the NEHRP Strategic Plan and in the Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction Implementation Plan of the NSTC Subcommittee for Disaster Reduction. Its full implementation is a top recommendation of the Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee, the FACA advisory committee to the USGS Director for the Earthquake Hazards Program.","Three gaps are identified, which ANSS would fill if fully implemented:1. Under the Stafford Act (1977), the USGS Director is delegated the federal responsibility for issuing warnings for earthquakes.  Currently, earthquake warnings are not feasible in the U.S. because current technology and monitoring infrastructure are inadequate.  ANSS, when fully implemented, will provide earthquake early warnings, where feasible, as a principal product within the ANSS product suite.  Equivalent systems are already in place in Japan, Taiwan, Mexico and elsewhere.2. Insufficient records of earthquake 'strong motion' are available to support the design of buildings, bridges and other structures.  This gap was identified in the 1990s, and subsequent reviews indicate that it persists to today.  ANSS is designed to collect, process and make available all relevant earthquake records, so that the nations building infrastructure can be adequately designed.  The cost-benefit of filling this gap was documented in detail in the ANSS cost-benefit study, published in 2005 (see Resource Documents).3. Current technology cannot quickly measure the size, extent and tsunami potential of the largest earthquakes.  It can take an hour or more for the size of the largest earthquakes to be precisely determined (e.g., the Japan earthquake of March, 2011).  To address this gap, it will be necessary to integrate geodetic data into ANSS.  Real-time, high-rate GPS can help quickly (within minutes) determine earthquake fault slip, orientation and extent.  When complete, tsunami warning will be more accurate, allowing more confident actions to be taken, and minimizing false alarms.","1. Estimated economic loss and casualty information is now included in ANSS &quot;PAGER&quot; earthquake alerts sent out following significant earthquakes around the world. These earthquake alerts are widely recognized and used by emergency responders, government and aid officials, and the public to understand the scope of the potential disaster and to develop the best response.  PAGER rapidly assesses earthquake impacts by estimating the shaking distribution, the number of people and settlements exposed to severe shaking, and the range of possible fatalities and economic losses, and provides color-coded alerts.2. As of August, 2011, the ANSS ARRA-funded upgrades are nearly complete.  Fro example, the National Earthquake Information Center has been hardened by adding more robust air conditioning, power backup, fire suppression, and increase incoming and outgoing bandwidth.  All ANSS &quot;Tier I&quot; data centers have received software upgrades as well.","At the current funding level, ANSS will be &quot;steady-state&quot; in 2012 and 2013.  In the first quarter of FY2012, work will be completed on a new ANSS earthquake catalog.  By the end of FY2012, a new metadata server will be completed, and able to provide a synoptic view of all of the system's data acquisition assets (seismic stations worldwide).  Performance tracking methods are being developed to enable a quick and regular assessment of system performance at any time, including data and products contributed to the system by partners.  Also in FY12, work will be completed to allow ANSS earthquake information and alerts to be distributed through the FEMA &quot;IPAWS&quot; national alerting system.  In addition, FY2012 will include a scheduled C&amp;A (recertification) of ANSS IT Security.In 2013 the system will be operated and maintained in its current state.",86.38,9.061,8.261,8.261,2000.0,2018.0,"The President's requested BY2012 budget for ANSS, $8.26 million, has not changed.

Note that many contracts are for steady-state (operational support) work. A significant fraction of ANSS funding is distributed through cooperative agreements with Universities (assistance). They are awarded through &quot;Limited Competition&quot;.  These delivery vehicles are not included in the contracts table.All ARRA procurements (2009-2011) were developed and implemented according to OMB guidance.,4,All ARRA funds are now obligated and the majority are expended.

The FBI s goal is to install 15,000 workstations by FY 2016.  At full base funding, the FBI can install 1,500 workstations each year.A reduction in SCION funding would significantly reduce the number of workstations deployed per year.  Without a SCION workstation, FBI personnel will be unable to access sensitive data sources, read and process intelligence products, post and disseminate intelligence products, or communicate in real time with their IC counterparts at the TS/SCI level.  The inability to communicate at the TS/SCI level will result in increased operational risks.  Additionally, a reduction in funding will impact SCION operations and maintenance and reduce the number of NGSCION deployments.

011-000003211,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The FBI currently uses hardcopy Case Files (paper file folders) to manage investigative and intelligence information. These paper documents are the official system of records. Concurrently, the Automated Case Support (ACS) captures electronic metadata about each document, along with text narrative for many of those documents, resulting in the maintenance of two records systems for almost every case document created. Sentinel will transform the way the FBI does business, allowing the FBI to move from a paper based reporting system to an electronic system of records, as well as to eliminate the redundancy in maintaining multiple systems. Sentinel will leverage technology to reduce redundancy, eliminate bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and maximize the FBI's ability to use the information in its possession.Sentinel provides an integrated system that will support the processing, storage and management of information to allow the FBI to effectively perform its investigative and intelligence operations. The system will provide a base for adding new functionalities and for supporting scalability that will be necessary to deal with increasing workloads, an expanding bureau workforce, and increasing data repository sizes. It's the intent of Sentinel to provide a set of highly integrated services that will support rapid and effective information sharing among Bureau personnel and with authorized external agencies.When completed, Sentinel will employ intranet technologies to enter, organize, search, and retrieve information and to import, export, and share case related information.  Sentinel capabilities are as follows: establish the foundation (hardware) upon which all future phases will be built and introduce the Sentinel user interface which provides a user-friendly interface to existing FBI information and includes work boxes summarizing a users workload; provide electronic document management; automate work flow, improve information indexing for more flexible search results; improve the process for handling evidence and centralize statistical reporting.The beneficiary of the system are the agents, analysts, and authorized external agencies the collection and sharing of investigative and intelligence data that supports the following major intelligence priorities by improving and increasing the FBI s ability to prevent  terrorist attacks; protect against espionage; protect against cyber-based attacks and high tech crimes; and deter and disrupt criminal acts.","The FBI Sentinel program closes the FBI IT infrastructure gap. The development of the Sentinel addresses the FBI ability to improve information to operations through IT innovation that is relevant, timely and functional by leveraging technologies and innovative reuse of existing technologies; and promote information sharing, collaboration and knowledge management.Sentinel provides a platform where users facilitate their investigative and admin duties within a collaborative environment; provides the functions designed to collect, collate, filter and manage information gathered from multiple data sources, legacy systems, and other business functions; provides for the storage and analysis of data, and the presentation and sharing of information to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the investigating agents from informational to operational actions.By utilizing Sentinel s three functional areas associated with case management of collected item management, task management, and indexing  along with data support capabilities, the FBI organization and partners have at their disposal the repository of collaborative and information sharing knowledge of data available for their investigative and administrative duties.

011-000002616,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The NICS mission is to enhance national security and public safety by providing the timely and accurate determination of a person s eligibility to possess firearms and/or explosives in accordance with federal law.  Title 18, Section 922 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), defines who is prohibited from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving any firearm or ammunition in or affecting commerce. The NICS Regulation, Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 25, Subpart A requires the NICS to provide Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) with an immediate response regarding the person from whom the receipt of a firearm would violate the U.S.C.  If the initial response is a &quot;delay,&quot; the NICS is required to provide the FFLs with a final determination within three business days.  The NICS Regulation provides the states with the option to act as a point of contact (POC) for NICS background checks and allows the FBI to serve as the POC in those states that have chosen not to perform the checks.  The NICS Regulation required development of other electronic means of contact and the NICS E-Check was developed.  This function enables the FFLs to initiate an unassisted NICS background check for firearm transfers via the Internet.  When the FFLs conduct a NICS Check, name and descriptive data is submitted to the NICS to determine if prohibitions exist.  During FY 2007, the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division's NICS Section initiated an extensive Business Process Redesign study to seek opportunities to improve the NICS. On 08-13-2009, the NICS Section initiated a requirements study for the development of a new NICS that encompassed all internal and external processes, interfaces, and functionality required throughout the NICS community and outlined required modifications and improvements to the NICS to allow continued system operating capabilities.  The continued success of the NICS is dependent on the New NICS development which will provide increased system availability and automate the NICS transaction life cycle process.  Efficiencies will be gained by reducing system/software redeliveries, utilizing Computer Telephone Integration technology, and having complete interoperability with NICS partners and agencies.  The primary beneficiaries of the NICS are the American public (protection from violent crime and terrorist acts) and law enforcement/public safety personnel.","Since implementation in 1998, NICS performance gaps have been identified.  These gaps include outdated technology, lack of scalability and flexibility, disparate database and components, lack of accessibility and availability, and business efficiencies.   There are significant risks if the new NICS is not developed.  The Brady Act gives the government three business days to make a final determination.  Current growth trends, in the form of ever increasing transaction volumes, indicate that NICS will not be able to meet this requirement in the next two years.   In the past the NICS has met all expectations set forth by new legislative requirements.  The NICS must be proactive for any future legislative requirements that may be brought forth.  The identified performance gaps would have an effect on how the NICS can make necessary changes to meet any new legislation.  Failure to make a legally defendable final determination within three business days would allow a possible firearms transfer to occur.  This NICS failure would allow guns into the hands of potentially dangerous individuals and presents a risk to the safety and security of the country.   In addition, the FBI s reputation is at risk if any individual commits a crime due to NICS not being able to make a final determination in a timely manner.  Failure to provide a determination in accordance with the Brady Act can potentially result in three situations:  Non-compliance with the Brady Act, firearms transfers to prohibited individuals, violation of the constitutional rights (second amendment) of lawful citizens. To close these gaps, a NICS overhaul is planned.  The New NICS Program Management Office anticipates the Request for Proposal (RFP) release in the second quarter of FY 2012.  Although source selection activities will begin in the second quarter, the final stages of source selection and contract award will occur in the third quarter of FY 2012.",Efficiency was added by prioritizing delayed transactions to ensure warrants are processed first.  Additional prioritization was created to ensure transactions are processed based on the Brady Transfer date.  A visual color indicator was also added to the NICS to indicate priority.  These changes aid in meeting the three-business day mandate.  Efficiency was added to the appeal process by providing the ability to insert comments and attachments simultaneously to all applicable appeal-related records for an individual appellant.  This time-saving initiative assists in managing the appeal backlog.  Audit and Purge Now Flags were added to all NICS transactions.  These flags are set by specific user roles and will keep a transaction from purging if an audit is needed and will fully purge a transaction during the next purge cycle if selected.  Efficiency was added to the quality review process by creating a review monitor for appeal-related records.,"The New NICS Program Management Office anticipates the Request for Proposal (RFP) release in the second quarter of FY 2012.  Although source selection activities will begin in the second quarter, the final stages of the source selection and contract award will occur in the third quarter of FY 2012.  An Initial Baseline Review will be conducted in the fourth quarter of FY 2012.  The New NICS Design Phase and Phase One are primarily planned for the FY 2013 budget year.  In the first quarter of FY 2013, the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) will be conducted followed by the Critical Design Review (CDR) and Final Design Review (FDR) in the second quarter of FY 2013.

011-000003245,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The PITO program is a consolidated FBI program established to replace and augment workspace IT hardware, such as desktops, laptops and print media, and to provide limited copier and software maintenance support in order to increase technology reliability for all Bureau employees and contractors that use workspace IT equipment on the three main enclaves:  FBINet, UNet and SCION.  The PITO investment supports the scheduled enterprise deployment of best-of-breed workspace IT infrastructure to ensure that the FBI's IT systems are up-to-date and operate effectively and efficiently to successfully support the mission of the FBI: to enforce federal laws and protect national security.  The upgraded workspace hardware will provide improved and powerful IT resources required to maximize analytical and discovery efforts. The program mainly provides enterprise-wide contract vehicles to purchase the above hardware and supports the FBI UNET and SCION investments, which rely on these IT components.  The program office also coordinates with the IT Engineering Division to support the IT needs assessment process; supports the selection process for next generation hardware; communicates the latest approved hardware list and the life-cycle technology status for relevant hardware and software products to all stakeholders by using the FBI's Standard Products List (SPL); and supports the planning and execution phases of major deployment initiatives for workspace hardware.  Lastly, the program supports the maintenance of selected copiers in use throughout the Bureau and provides funding (when available) to repair workspace IT hardware that are out of warranty.","The latest FBI IT Strategic plan identified the Bureau's IT infrastructure as a performance gap, part of which included deficiencies in network and information sharing capabilities. The IT improvements gained through the use of the PITO contractual vehicle fully address the risk of the steady degradation of IT capabilities and deliver new and efficient ways to communicate and collaborate with Bureau employees across the enterprise.  The PITO investment will support the FBI's mission of implementing a unified communication (UC) strategy and posture to increase and simplify service availability and to encourage more real time intra-agency collaborative initiatives.  The PITO contract is the backbone of the Next Generation Workspace (NGW) refresh initiative that has incorporated a variety of elements of UC, such as improved instant messaging, telephony, video, and email, all of which can be accomplished in real time and in an easy, cost effective and coordinated fashion.There will be severe operational and financial consequences if the PITO investment is not fully funded.  The potential drawbacks include: degradation of operational readiness to fully tackle the ever growing and prevalent law enforcement and national security challenges due to old, inefficient or inoperable hardware; increasing maintenance and replacement costs associated with continuous and frequent hardware breakdowns after the completion of the warranty period; and considerable loss of productive hours due to hardware being down or running inefficiently. Sustaining and upgrading this critical IT asset to optimally operate in a more resilient and agile environment will ensure the continuation of the FBI's indispensable services to the United States citizens.","In FY 2011, the PITO investment supported the New Generation Workspace (NGW) effort to upgrade desktops and associated peripherals at the Headquarters.  This upgrade effort integrated new and improved communication and collaboration tools, such as desktop cameras and headsets to be used with Microsoft Office Communicator.  The enhanced NGW components improved the operational capabilities of the workspace IT hardware by introducing significantly higher processing and memory speed and new collaboration tools required to easily communicate with fellow employees, such as improved instant messaging, telephony, video, and email.  Planned refresh intiatives for laptops and Multi-Function Printers (MFPs) have been delayed to a later time due to budget shortfall.","The PITO investment will provide mainly operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) support for the following areas in the CY (2012) and BY (2013):- Provide funding for the maintenance and licensing of selected baseline software products;- Provide limited funds for and facilitate the repair of workspace related IT hardware that are out of warranty;- Manage and provide funding for the maintenance of the majority of copiers throughout the Bureau; and - Provide administrative support (contractual, technical, billing, and warranty) for all workspace IT hardware that are provided through the PITO contract.",188.748,91.033,8.183461,8.528767,2007.0,2017.0,"The funding level for CY 2012 increased from $6.23M to $8.18M.

011-000002705,11,Department of Justice,20,Federal Prison System,"Sentry is the Bureau's primary mission support system in that it is used to collect, maintain, and reportinmate information that is critical to the safe and orderly operation of all Bureau facilities. Sentry enables the Bureauto maintain proper custody of persons committed to the custody of the Attorney General and/or the BOP, as itprovides information regarding security and custody levels, inmate program and work assignments, and otherpertinent information about the inmate population.Sentry also provides automated tools for the administration of complex statutes and regulations regarding thecalculation of sentences, with near zero error rate. It allows the Bureau to implement provisions of federal statutes,regulations, and other laws which may require special treatment of inmate subgroups within the institution.Since its inception, Sentry was designed to automate resource-intensive, operational functions within eachinstitution. Each module effectively replaced extensive paper flows, thereby conserving staff time by reducingduplicative and redundant data entry, eliminating errors, and providing for more efficient operations. Anymodifications or enhancements to Sentry programs continue to follow that same design goal.","This investment supports BOP's mission to protect society by confining offenders in the controlled environment of prisons.   It also directly supports the agency's strategic goal to proactively manage its offender population to ensure safe and secure operations.  Sentry provides knowledge management capabilities to staff.  Information can be stored and accessed over the long term by all staff.  Knowledge formerly possessed only by certain senior skilled staff are now incorporated into the system and are available to all staff.  For example, calculating an inmate's release date is a complex task, particularly when the inmate s criminal term contains multiple types of sentences, &quot;Old Law&quot; (parole eligible), &quot;New Law&quot; (No parole but good time eligible), state law convictions and/or other federal convictions, etc.  Sentry is capable of calculating a final release date once staff enters in the individual conviction information.In another example, Sentry supports maintaining high security offenders.  The Central Inmate Monitoring module is used to track inmates needing special supervision, such as those under special management restrictions who have threatened the President of the United States or other high-ranking government officials.  The module is also used to protect Witness Security cases.  It is the BOP's responsibility to provide adequate, segregated care and housing for those inmates who are cooperating witnesses in federal government trials.Lack of funding for this investment could have an adverse impact on the efficient management of the Witness Security operations, the management of all offenders within BOP custody, the safety of staff in carrying out the duties of prison operations, and a negative impact on society as a whole.",- Implemented Adam Walsh Act triggers to ensure inmates are not released without appropriate reviews. - Implemented new security architecture to support userid role management upon full deployment of the web-based Sentry application.- Completed development of production level benchmarks and scripts for performance testing of web-based Sentry application..,- Complete production performance testing analysis and implement recommended performance enhancements.- Perform production deployment of web-base SENTRY for all of BOP (CY 2012).- Implement the use of a portion of a digital inmate central file at BOP's centralized Sentence Computation Center (CY 2012).,297.378,33.36793,34.3505,36.4569,1981.0,2016.0,Adjustments were made to account for actual cost in PY and anticipated budget cuts for CY.,The contracts due not meet DOJ's required monetary threshold requiring the use of EVM.,4,The Web Sentry Migration project completed two months ahead of schedule.

011-000002503,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The FBI Digital Collection Investment enables the FBI to collect evidence and intelligence, pursuant to lawful authority, to protect the United States from terrorist attack and against foreign intelligence operations, as well as to successfully pursue domestic criminal activity. It provides Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) systems that collect evidentiary audio and signal-related intelligence from telephone, microphone, and facsimile sources. The numerous beneficiaries of this investment include Case Agents, Linguists, Intelligence Analysts, and Other Government Agencies (OGA). The current enterprise consists of 15 Title 50 foreign intelligence collection systems, currently in development/modernization/enhancement (DME), and 62 Title III Criminal Law Enforcement (CLE) collection systems, also known as the Digital Collection System 6000 (DCS-6000), in Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M). Further, this investment includes the O&amp;M DCS-3000. DCS-3000 provides signal information to both Title 50 and Title III collection systems for cell phone and Short Messaging Services (SMS) intercepts. Finally, Integration and Engineering Services (IES), which is the middleware between Title 50 collection systems, the Title 50 collection enterprise, and OGAs, is included in this investment. In FY 2011, a majority of the FBI's Title 50 collection systems reached the end of their useful life. To continue to meet the FBI's strategic goal of protecting the U.S. from terrorist attack, the Telecommunications Intercept and Collection Technology Unit (TICTU) continues to test and field its Next Generation (NG) Title 50 collection system, also known as the NG DCS-5000. This improved system modernizes and regionalizes Title 50 collection, closing the gap between current and future required capabilities by establishing consolidated regional collection sites and reducing the number of deployed systems. In addition, TICTU has also begun the regionalization of its DCS-6000. The overall objective of these efforts is to consolidate the digital collection architecture to meet cost and performance objectives and to provide scalability to accommodate increases in session activity and number of users. These efforts will position TICTU and the FBI to meet its future requirements by providing the flexibility and adaptability necessary to meet new and more advanced collection demands. The FBI Digital Collection Investment does not depend on any other investments for its success.","Recent technology developments, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Voice over Packet (VoP), have dramatically increased in number and complexity, providing terrorists and criminals many avenues to coordinate and commit offenses against U.S. citizens and interests. Current methods of ELSUR have limited-life utility in intercepting newer and more secure types of publicly offered communications, resulting in a continual and growing need for advanced ELSUR methods for voice communications. Further, the expansion of ELSUR activity in frequency, sophistication, and linguistic needs substantially increases the level of support, transportability, and information sharing required. The FBI Digital Collection Investment seeks to close the performance gap left by the legacy systems by modernizing and regionalizing the collection enterprise. This will provide the FBI with the capability, flexibility, and scalability necessary to meet its current and future mission requirements. This investment will also provide three dedicated Disaster Recovery (DR) facilities that will offer added data storage capabilities and provide a fully redundant operational collection system. These DR facilities will help reduce the vulnerability of data loss, ensure the availability of collected data, and allow for quick recovery in the event of a disaster. However, if this investment is not fully funded, the FBI will be unable to ensure that the NG DCS-5000 and DCS-6000 collection systems will be able to meet future requirements, adapt to the future technologies previously listed, and maintain collection and data availability in the event of a disaster. These consequences could reduce the ability of the FBI to collect foreign intelligence and criminal evidence, thereby reducing the safety of the U.S., its interests, and its citizens.","In Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, 7 NG DCS-5000 collection systems were deployed, resulting in a total of 12 of 15 legacy DCS-5000 replaced with NG DCS-5000 systems. The NG DCS-5000 systems provide improved collection, retention, analysis, and sharing capabilities and help close the gap between current and future requirements. The IES portion of the digital collection enterprise continued to be rolled out, allowing increased information sharing between NG DCS-5000 collection systems and between the NG DCS-5000 collection enterprise and OGAs. Additionally, preliminary steps were taken to reduce the footprint of the DCS-6000 collection enterprise in order to provide a more efficient and agile approach to DCS-6000 collection. These steps will help reduce costs while resulting in no loss of functionality or collection capability.","In FY 2012, the final three NG DCS-5000 collection systems will be deployed, including the two largest systems that each have six times the collection capability of a standard system and present a new set of technical and logistical challenges. After the last 3 systems are installed during this CY, all 15 of the NG DCS-5000 systems will be deployed and all legacy DCS-5000 collections systems will be decommissioned. Additionally, three DR sites will be deployed as part of the IES and NG DCS-5000 effort to reduce the vulnerability of data loss, ensure the availability of collected Title 50 foreign intelligence, and provide a fully redundant operational collection system. Finally, in FY 2012 TICTU will begin consolidating and regionalizing the DCS-6000 collection enterprise by deploying a standard enterprise architecture, reducing the number of collection systems deployed to the field, and modernizing the collection systems that remain. Once completed, the DCS-6000 collection system consolidations will result in significant cost saving to the FBI as a result of decreased operations, maintenance, and licensing costs. In FY 2013, TICTU will continue to support the NG DCS-5000 system, now in its Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) state. Efforts will continue in FY 2013 to consolidate and regionalize the DCS-6000 collection enterprise. Finally, as hardware is replaced every four to five years as part of the normal technology refresh cycle, 20-25% off all deployed hardware will be replaced. The technology refresh will replace obsolete equipment and outdated software.",381.963,41.747,43.305,37.293,2000.0,2030.0,"The difference between the FY President's Budget request for the PY and the current PY costs is updates to reflect when services were rendered, updates to Government FTE costs to add fringe benefits, and changes to update actual expenses.

011-000002501,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) fully supports the FBI mission by aiding criminal investigation and surveillance while supporting the Lab Division's strategic goal of providing collection and examination capabilities as well as assisting state and local law enforcement.  CODIS is the generic term used to describe the FBI's program of support for criminal justice DNA databases as well as the software used to run these databases. The National DNA Index System or NDIS is considered one part of CODIS, the national level, containing the DNA profiles contributed by federal, state, and local participating forensic laboratories.  This automated DNA information processing and telecommunications system generates potential investigative leads in cases where biological evidence (DNA) is recovered.  CODIS links crime scene evidence to other crimes and/or offenders which identify serial offenders and/or potential suspects.  In addition, CODIS software specializes in missing person DNA searches as well as disaster victim identification. The CODIS Program started as a pilot project in 1990 with ten laboratories. The Federal DNA Identification Act of 1994 authorized the establishment of a national DNA identification index and in October, 1998 NDIS became operational.  All 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice Crime Laboratories, the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Laboratory, and Puerto Rico participate in NDIS.  The CODIS Unit serves over 191 NDIS participating laboratories and 76 international laboratories representing 38 countries.  To date, NDIS contains over 10 million searchable DNA profiles and has aided over 169,000 investigations.  Reliability and expandability of CODIS are critical in the FBI's ability to effectively aid law enforcement investigations and serve the public through the use of biometrics. CODIS has no dependencies between this or other investments.","The DNA Identification Act in 1994 established FBI NDIS as the National authority providing searching and ranking of DNA profiles entered at the State and local laboratories.  The allowance for interstate data sharing of offender and crime scene DNA aided in the ability to solve crimes through biometrics at 14 labs initially.  In the early stages, CODIS utilized nuclear DNA profiles contained in a convicted offender index against a forensic index containing DNA profiles developed from crime scene evidence.  Over the following 10 years, the incorporation of Missing Persons, Unidentified Human Remains and Biological Relatives of Missing Persons indexes contributed to CODIS by expanding DNA technologies and searching.  Aggregate investigations aided since the program's inception through April 2012 are upwards of 169,000.  CODIS must maintain the processing and searching ability to support the current and projected volume of users.  Currently supporting more than 260 installations and ~3000 users, CODIS continues to add DNA technologies and support systems integration through the use of biometrics while maintaining system performance.   With the delivery of CODIS 7.0, processing and search requirements have been met for an exponentially growing number of DNA profiles housed at NDIS.  NDIS currently has over 10 million profiles.  DNA match technologies (eg. electropheram, base composition, full mtDNA sequence, mini-STRs, SNPs) and the support of international data exchange standards (eg. ISO Standard (19794-14) for DNA Data) will continue to fill the program gaps as funding becomes available in 2014 and beyond.  The impact of not funding future development limits the FBI's ability to lead the International effort in DNA data sharing standards, incorporate known requirements (Section B.6.) as well as the ability to incorporate emergent legislative requirements.","In FY11, CODIS Operations supported two fielded baselines, CODIS legacy 5.7.x and 6.1. CODIS 5.7.x is the operational baseline for the majority of CODIS users (approximately 220 labs).  Accomplishments include successfully initiating weekly autosearches at NDIS, managing the help desk and exercising 2 annual COOP exercises without incident.Dispositions on 5.7.x aided in more than 23,000 investigations. CODIS development effectively completed final design, development and testing of the final 7.0 baseline which will deliver one software baseline incorporating all existing 5.7.x functionality currently serving convicted offender labs and CODIS 6.x functionality serving Missing Persons labs.  The program successfully passed FBI managed software control gates to date.  Transition activities occurred to ensure the Operations team was fully prepared to deploy the 7.0 baseline in FY12 to all existing CODIS labs. Key in FY11 was the delivery of CODIS 7.0 to the European Union (EU) countries.","In FY2012, the focus will be on deploying 7.0 through a phased regional approach to include on-site training to 200 plus domestic laboratories and completion of software deployment to 20+ European Union countries.  CODIS 7.0 provides forensic DNA laboratories the ability to: Conduct incremental searching and uploads; efficient processing of large databases up to 50 million specimens; incorporate all European Union functionality (international data sharing requirements); support additional population statistical calculations as well as calculations on single source samples; batch and remote searching and additional search configurations; bulk update specimen management features; match counting and match ID/rank ID display capabilities; partial profile indicator; Interpol export format; specimen audit trail; and improved configurations.  Maintenance will be provided via hotfixes and service packs planned to address deficiencies discovered post implementation, planned deferred requirements and regular modifications due to security patch updates to the operating environment. In BY13, the focus will remain on stabilization of fielded CODIS 7.0 to a large user base, adding new laboratories and additional CODIS participating countries, as well as deliver the first maintenance service pack following 7.0 deployment.  CODIS will focus on post deployment software maintenance activities and support to Operational activities.  The user base of more than 260 laboratories will require help desk support, training and software hotfixes.   Additionally, maintenance for version 7.0 will be delivered in the planned service packs and hot fixes during the post deployment phase.  These are largely usability and interface upgrades that will aid in daily operational use to the end user.   Many of these improvements are targeted features benefitting the Missing Persons community. The goal for CODIS 7.0 is to field a single unified version of CODIS. The ability to effectively utilize all available DNA data in a full database search within the specified search parameters is a success indicator on a large scale.Until development funding is secured, this investment will remain in an O&M state effectively managing several maintenance service packs as well as operating the 7.0 baseline.",145.249,24.029637,19.89,10.201,1998.0,2019.0,"In FY11, the variance in DME is due to allotted dollars for Unisys Incentive fee, hosting fees and subcontractor invoices (September) that will carry over into FY12.

011-000003177,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), headed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), maintains the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), commonly referred to as the Terrorist Watchlist, that serves as the U.S. Government s consolidated watchlist for terrorist screening information. Members of the Intelligence Community, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Central Intelligence Agency submit to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) their nominations of known and suspected international terrorists for inclusion in the NCTC's Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) database. These nominations are carefully vetted and then forwarded to the TSC for continued vetting and possible inclusion in the Terrorist Watchlist. The FBI also submits to the TSC the identities of known and suspected domestic terrorists. On a daily basis, the TSC conducts over 1,000 unique database transactions that result in the addition, modification, or deletion of known or suspected terrorist identities contained in TSDB. Applicable portions of the TSDB are provided to law enforcement, intelligence, and other governmental as well as foreign partners. This screening process is a significant force multiplier to the Nation s counterterrorism initiatives, empowering thousands of law enforcement officers and other governmental workers to play an important role in efforts to identify, deter, and capture known and suspected terrorists. The Encounter Management Application (EMA) is a web-based application that also supports the TSC encounter management process. The TSC fulfills a vital function for the U.S. Government and will pursue every feasible technological  innovation  to improve its effectiveness. The TSDB has become one of our most effective national resources as we continue with the war against international terrorism. The information technology requirements associated with TSC require ongoing investment to keep the database applications and underlying infrastructure in an operational state.  New operational requirements cause TSC Information Technology elements to remain in a mixed life cycle for the foreseeable future.  TSC application improvements occur through an Agile Software Development process, with new application releases planned on a quarterly basis.  The application updates are a result of evolving requirements/directives.","Prior to the creation of the TSDB, information about known or suspected terrorists was dispersed throughout the U.S. Government and no one agency was charged with consolidating it and making it available for use in terrorist screening. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD-6), the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) now provides  one-stop shopping  so that every government screener is using the same terrorist watchlist whether it is an airport screener, an embassy official issuing visas overseas, or a state or local law enforcement officer on the street. The TSC allows government agencies to run name checks against the same comprehensive list with the most accurate, up-to-date information about known and suspected terrorists. TSS will operate a 24/7 operations center for encounter identification assistance and a coordinated response for federal, state, and local law enforcement that will allow for integrated tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination functions across the Intelligence Community (IC). This will establish the TSC as a link between domestic and international screening and law enforcement partners in the IC, diplomatic personnel, law enforcement arenas, and build collaborative relationships with foreign intelligence.  If TSS is not fully funded it will inhibit the 24/7 operational requirements and the ability to support federal, state, and locat law enforcement. TSS will not maintain a formal process for tracking encounters, which assist with trend analysis and the possible actionable intelligence that would be developed and passed to the appropriate entities, and the redress process to provide the timely and fair review of terrorism-related watchlist complaint.","Terrorist Screening Data Base (TSDB) 2.9 was deployed to Implement the person centric model in TSDB and be prepared to accept the new TWPDES 3.0 export from TIDE2, Implement a new interface through Remote Access (RA) and the networking to support a transactional export between TIDE2 and TSDB and Enhance the Secure Flight export to include a new Expanded Selectee (ESEL) Watchlist designation.

011-000002016,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"LEO is a virtual information-sharing system provided by the FBI to all levels of the law enforcement, criminal justice, and intelligence communities and is an &quot;anytime and anywhere&quot; system for secure dissemination of Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU)/Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).  The LEO system provides a free of charge, secure, internet-based communications network.  LEO has grown from 29 members at its inception in 1995 to over 55,000 active members and more than 19,000 organizations as of June 30, 2011.  The LEO system currently has 14 hosted and 13 connected systems, as well as the Virtual Command Center (VCC), a situational awareness and crisis management tool that provides support for operational and crisis situations and natural disasters.  Another vital service is the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) which provide multi-level access areas for members to participate in communities of specialized interests to share information, database resources, and access to other partnering networks.  LEO is used to support investigative operations and provide access to a wide variety of law enforcement and intelligence systems and resources.Although it is considered a system in the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) phase, LEO is currently in the process of a technical refresh.  This technical refresh will move the legacy system onto new hardware and will provide an upgraded communication suite.The LEO program is a participant with the Program Manager-Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE).  LEO is one of four systems which will lead the way for interoperability between a broader set of SBU/CUI systems and eventually allow users to log in just once to access multiple systems.The FBI promotes an information-sharing culture and through LEO provides an infrastructure to implement information sharing with the FBI's many mission partners, which includes local, state, tribal, federal, and foreign law enforcement, as well as, intelligence and criminal justice organizations.","The United States is continually confronted with threats by organized and capable terrorist and criminal groups that have successfully attacked our commercial, diplomatic, and military interests around the world.  Credible and comprehensive reviews of such incidents have led to a mandate for the FBI to provide new operational capabilities and to provide broad, immediate dissemination of SBU/CUI information outside traditional agency &quot;stove piped&quot; systems.  In order to eliminate such information being isolated within a single agency's system, the LEO program continues to identify and integrate with other secure networks which leverage local, state, and federal resources in response to these global threats.The LEO program continually strives to produce, maintain, and improve upon the LEO Information Technology Architecture as well as specific applications and functions provided to the law enforcement, emergency management, and intelligence communities.  With dedicated funding resources LEO will continue to support FBI, Department of Justice (DOJ), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) information sharing objectives by leveraging the resources of all participating agencies in a cost-effective, member-friendly environment with the stated goal of providing an innovative, state-of-the-art, single sign-on (SSO), information-sharing system.The sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information and collaboration decreases information gaps by proving critical national and regional intelligence that uncovers actionable threat activity.  The LEO system provides a protected SBU/CUI platform to enable the connection to shared spaces.  This allows users access to a broad range of information without leaving the confines of their home organization.  Without this secure vehicle, there will be limited intelligence and investigative data available to the intelligence and law enforcement communities that require this information in their mission to fight crime and fortify the nation's security.Fully funding the LEO investment will be necessary to maintain the current level of availability to the LEO users.  Impacts, if not fully funded, could result in potential reductions to the level of services, such as:  increased answer time for Help Desk support calls; delay in posting critical requests such as intelligence bulletins and alert messages; and delays in posting VCC content, which could impact coordination of critical events.","In FY 2011, the LEO system accomplished the following:  * As directed by the PM-ISE Initiative, LEO completed an Intelink search connection which allows users access to an Intelink search portal hosted by DOJ.   * In December 2010, CJIS single sign-on capabilities became operational.  LEO connected to the CJIS portal link, established five identity providers, and connected six service providers.  * Shared user and service directories with the Homeland Security Information Network, Regional Information Sharing System, and Intelink, providing a foundation for an integrated, cross-network set of directories to help users more easily locate individuals.  * Implemented VCC enhancements, such as displaying incidents by specific dates or times and allowing a refresh of selected screens.  * Enabled SIG and VCC restricted access.  * Established &quot;My SIGs&quot; portal channel on the front page of LEO.  * Deployed the Polygraph (PIN) hosted database.","For FY 2012:The work to complete the LEO Rehost and communications suite enhancements is being conducted as an O&amp;M task and is contingent upon available resources.  However, work is currently scheduled to be completed in FY 2012.   * The LEO System will be installed and configured on new IBM blade servers running VMware purchased by the LEO Program Office in January 2010.  * Out-of-date Email will be updated to expand functionality.  * Issues with Chat will be resolved to allow compatibility with newer versions of the Java programming language.  * Broken links will be repaired and other Search crawler issues addressed to ensure Search functionality works effectively.  * Language translation software will be added to meet the needs of LEO international members.  * A Content Management System will be implemented to streamline LEO content-sharing abilities.  * The legacy LEO will be integrated into the CJIS LEO-Enterprise Portal (LEO-EP).For FY 2013:Planned accomplishments to the LEO system will include the following:  * LEO services will be hosted on the Portal along with other beneficial resources provided by various Service Providers.  * Identify and deliver new identity providers and connected services to leverage and expand information sharing access.   * Increase and improve efficiencies and capabilities of the LEO system.  * Implement VCC enhancements to increase stakeholders' abilities to combat crime and terrorism.",225.599,23.972,23.503,24.288,1995.0,2017.0,"In the FY 2012 President's Budget request, the LEO Program included estimated costs for a cloud computing solution.

011-000002502,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is an automated database of criminal justice information as reported to the FBI by law enforcement agencies throughout the United States and internationally.  The NCIC database consists of 19 data files.  Seven property files contain records for articles, boats, guns, license plates, securities, vehicles and vehicle and boat parts.  The 12 person files are the Foreign Fugitive, Gang, Identify Theft, Immigration Violator, Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist (KST), Missing Person, National Sexual Offender Registry, Protection Order, Protective Interest, Supervised Release, Unidentified Person, and Wanted Person Files.  In addition, the NCIC includes an Image File and a file of Originating Agency Identifiers.  The NCIC network is also a conduit for the Interstate Identification File, which is an index of approximately 50 million criminal history record subjects, and is available through other FBI systems such as National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and National Data Exchange (N-DEx).                                                                                                                                 The focus of the development, maintenance, and enhancement efforts is to (1) upgrade the hardware/software to ensure that the system continues to provide quality service and dependability; and (2) enhance existing services and develop new services as requested by the law enforcement community. The primary purpose of NCIC is to electronically exchange criminal justice information with law enforcement and criminal justice agencies for use in the investigation of local, state, tribal, federal, and international crimes and for the protection of citizens from criminal activity.  It is a valuable tool that aids law enforcement officers, investigators, judges, prosecutors, correction officers, court administrators, and other law enforcement and criminal justice agency officials in the execution of their day-to-day operations.  The NCIC contains over 12 million active records and processes an average of 7.9 million transactions a day.  In an era where information sharing is a critical mandate across the criminal justice community, the goal of the NCIC program is to continue providing more criminal justice data that is meaningful for our customers by developing and applying targeted solutions for CJIS partners to stop and disrupt violent crime patterns.","The services of NCIC have been available for more than 40 years and are provided to combat criminal activity that threatens the safety and security of society. Information sharing is mission critical to today s public safety mandate as the United States is continually confronted with threats by organized and capable terrorist and criminal groups that have successfully attacked our commercial, diplomatic, and military interests around the world. The NCIC closes the sharing gap by serving more than 90,000 criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and Canada, as well as federal criminal justice agencies.   NCIC transactions have increased an average of 10% per year from its current customers. This last year, the system saw an increase in transaction volume of more than 13% due to the Government-wide information sharing initiatives of the Department of Homeland Security. On July 29, 2011, NCIC processed a record-breaking 9.8 million transactions with an average response time of .0521 seconds. The CJIS Division is addressing the growing needs of NCIC by currently performing a technical refresh, although the system is considered to be in an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) phase. This refresh will be completed with two different approaches. The first approach was to upgrade the obsolete mainframes with newer mainframes in FY 2011. This provided the capacity needed for daily operations and future enhancements. The other approach is called the  Legacy Migration , which if developed  will reduce O&amp;M  lifecycle costs and be in compliance with the FBI s Enterprise Architecture.In the past 20 years, NCIC investigative services have resulted in 61,000 arrests and $ 2.4 billion of recoveries (gov t benefits, drugs, vehicles, etc.). In 2011 alone the License Plate Reader program, which enhances the identification and recovery of stolen vehicles, controls access to specific locations, or cross-check for violations; has recovered 1,102 stolen vehicles with a value of more than $ 6.5 million, found 818 Wanted Persons, found 19 Missing Persons, and apprehended 2,611 other persons. Not having NCIC would be devastating to the criminal justice and law enforcement communities. This tool is essential for information sharing to enable authorized users to effectively perform their jobs, protect themselves in the line of duty, and defend the communities where they live and work.","On 10/3/2010, the Person with Information (PWI) enhancement was implemented.  This is a supplemental record appended to an NCIC Missing Person File record entered into the Endangered or Involuntary categories.  This enhancement created searchable fields within the Missing Person File record for information pertaining to a person who may have information regarding an abduction for whom there is no warrant.  On 7/18/ 2011, the NCIC Operations and Policy Unit (NOPU) awarded a one year contract to rewrite the NCIC Operating Manual.  The purpose of this is to make the existing manual user friendly and include all policy and technical updates.On 4/4/2011 the Protective Interest File (PIF) was implemented.  The PIF was designed to aid law enforcement agencies in their protective mission.  Only law enforcement agencies with a protective mission as specified within federal, state, or municipal statute, regulation, or other appropriate legal authority may enter and update records in the PIF.","Award Phase 1 of the Legacy Migration, which is to perform an assessment of the existing mainframes to see if can be upgraded to a Blade infrastructure.Award Phase 2 (development) of the Legacy Migration if Phase 1 is successful.  Award the CJIS Information Broker (CIB) Study.  The CIB Study will provide a full CONOPs and a SRS so that the CIB can be developed.  The CIB will enhance NCIC by developing information brokers that will provide a data sharing capability from one or more data sources.  Deploy a build in October 2011 that will include: Adding an Ethnicity Field to all NCIC person file records; and allowing the entry of lost public safety, homeland security, and critical infrastructure equipment in the NCIC Article File.Deploy a build in August 2012 that will include:  Creating the NICS Denied Transaction File; allowing the entry of foreign sex offender records in the NSOR; and creating the OPT Field for Article and Vehicle File records to indicate whether records can be disseminated to the public.",436.565,23.829,45.091,27.374,1999.0,2017.0,"Additional funding is due to performing the CJIS Information Broker (CIB) and NCIC 2020 Study.

011-000003373,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The Guardian program serves a mission to support the FBI's  role in defending the United States and U. S. interests abroad from the threat of terrorism by receiving, assessing, disseminating and retaining threats, suspicious activity and events with a potential nexus to terrorism. It consists of two information systems: the classified version, Guardian, and the unclassified version, eGuardian. The Guardian system is used by all FBIHQ units, FBI Field Offices, Legal Attaches and Intelligence Community partners for Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR). Launched in 2004 as a web-based and paperless counterterrorism incident management system, Guardian allows all terrorist threats and suspicious activities to be entered, assigned, managed and viewed instantaneously by all system users.  The primary purpose of Guardian is to make threat and suspicious activity information available immediately to all system users at a point when threat mitigation through redeployment of resources is optimal.  Based on the success of the system for threat trend analysis, the FBI has designated Guardian as the only information system to be used to document all official counterterrorism early stage investigations, known as Type 1  &amp; Type 2 Assessments. The Guardian system is the primary FBI counterterrorism tool to ensure that no threat incident is left unaddressed.  Currently, there are over 168,480 threat and suspicious activity incidents contained within Guardian. There are 24,195 registered accounts and 14,720 active users.The eGuardian system was developed as a result of The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), other statutes, including Executive Order (EO) 13388, and the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism. Its purpose is to build strong and functional liaison partnerships with state, local, tribal and other federal law enforcement agencies across the U.S. for threat incident reporting. This system provides participating partners with a SAR system, accessible via Law Enforcement Online (LEO). The two systems feature a one-way transfer of information from the unclassified eGuardian to the classified Guardian system. Both systems also communicate and transfer information to other government law enforcement and homeland security organizations through PM-ISE's  National Sharing Initiative.  The eGuardian system now contains 11,270 incidents with 2,946 registered accounts and 2,328 active users.","The Guardian Program (G/eG) fills a critical gap for terrorist threat assessment.  The advent of global terror networks in the 21st Century spurred the creation of multiple suspicious activity reporting and threat information sharing systems operating among the intelligence community and law enforcement (LE) agencies. Although useful in closed environments, these systems were not web-enabled or paperless and were unavailable to LE officers in other state, local or tribal jurisdictions. Other linked systems that provide interagency, cross-jurisdictional operability have been slow to materialize. Terrorists routinely use jurisdictional boundaries to their advantage to escape prosecution. For this reason it is critical that information about possible terrorist activities be made available and shared to LE in all relevant jurisdictions through mature, proven systems. Here are a few examples illustrating how G/eG  s  homeland protection features and information sharing capabilities fill the agency's performance gap: 1) Since Guardian 2.0 came online in October 2006, approximately 1,265 Preliminary and/or Full Field FBI Investigations have been initiated based on initial Guardian incidents. In addition, hundreds of criminal investigations, including 994 bomb threats and other terrorist investigations have resulted from initial Guardian incidents. 2) In May 2007, the widely publicized Fort Dix Six investigation, in which potential terrorists conspired to kill U.S. servicemen at Fort Dix, NJ, was worked entirely as a Guardian Incident. This threat to military personnel at Fort Dix is just an example of a Guardian incident that resulted in an official, full investigation with subsequent conviction. Since 2009 Guardian has supported the Attorney General s Guidelines for Domestic Investigation Operations Guide (AGG DIOG   as the only FBI information system for documenting early counterterrorism investigations known as Type 1 &amp; Type 2 FBI Assessments. G/eG are the only systems that accommodate the DIOG 2.0 to include recent, extensive revisions.  No other system is available to provide this support. In 2007 the DoD announced they would terminate use of the TALON threat database and begin using eGuardian. The eGuardian system is now poised to become operational and deployed worldwide for DoD in 2012. The Guardian Program interfaces with the National Sharing Environment, uploads information using a NIEM standard and provides valuable intelligence to others.","1) Primary accomplishments included adaptation of the Guardian/eGuardian systems to comply with OIG 09-02 audit findings including development of a countdown alert system to close incidents within 30 days, development and implementation of a quarterly maintenance, bug fix and patch schedule, and enhanced metrics for management reporting of incident and assessment resolution. 2) Full functionality was achieved with the electronic transfer of incidents between the two systems--eGuardian to Guardian and Guardian to eGuardian including redaction capability for classified incidents. 3) Guardian was modified with additional features to provide extended compliance with requirements of DIOG for FBI Type 1/Type 2 Assessments. 4) Email notification, custom search, save search and online help features were developed and implemented for eGuardian. 5) Designed , developed and implemented features to synchronize Guardian with the FBI's Next Generation Workspaces and Internet Explorer 7.","Current Year :     Complete the design, development, integration testing and documentation for Guardian 2.5. Provide a new platform for the application and refined user interface for more efficient data entry.

011-000003457,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated the Next Generation Identification (NGI) Program in response to advances in technology, FBI customer requirements, growing demand for Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) services, and growing obsolescence of the IAFIS Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. More than 18,000 local, state, tribal, federal, and international partners electronically submit requests to IAFIS.  The NGI Program is advancing the FBI's biometric identification and investigation services by providing an incremental replacement of current IAFIS technical capabilities, while introducing new biometric functionality. The NGI Program is the cornerstone that enables the FBI to meet its criminal justice service mission and continue to build its reputation as a global leader in biometrics. The FBI is dramatically improving all of the major features of the current IAFIS, including system flexibility, storage capacity, accuracy and timeliness of responses, and interoperability with other systems - such as, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) biometric matching systems. The NGI Program is addressing the increase in identification requests in the form of biometric submissions. It is also addressing the rapidly expanding database of biometric information and new biometric identifiers necessary to keep pace with evolving tribal, local, state, federal, international and intelligence requirements. New and more accurate biometric identification and investigation capabilities are being incorporated incrementally.","The NGI Program is taking a twofold approach to meet identified gaps in current technology.1) Improving Existing Biometric Services:    NGI increases performance accuracy to 99% (92% in AFIS).  NGI provides an improved algorithm to increase system performance for flat prints.  NGI allows federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies search latents against the unsolved latent file.2) New Biometric Services:  Latent examiners estimate that approximately 30% of latent prints are palm.  NGI is introducing a National Palmprint System (NPS) that will provide the means to identify those palmprints via a nationwide search.  NGI's new Rap Back service allows authorized agencies to receive and share notification of subsequent criminal activity reported to the NGI system.  The Repository for Individuals of Special Concern (RISC) provides the capability for law enforcement officers to receive biometric based information rapidly while in the field.  This capability is critical to reducing terrorism and criminal activity.  NGI will improve Government-wide biometric information sharing. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 24 [Biometrics for Identification and Screening to Enhance National Security] requires agencies to use mutually compatible methods and procedures in the collection, storage, use, analysis, and sharing of biometric and associated biographic and contextual information.  NGI is implementing multiple features to adhere to this directive.  Most notable is the system's ability to return ten second results from a comprehensive master criminal file search at U.S. ports of entry.  NGI proactively aids investigations through offerings of new modalities to speed and support investigations (e.g., photos).  NGI is implementing additional mechanisms for contributors to submit electronic dispositions.  This provides increased compliance with legislature mandates for fair and accurate criminal histories.    Mandate for civil background checks.  Legislation is driving an increase in civil background check (e.g., individuals in service jobs that come in contact with children, elderly, or mentally/physically challenged persons require background checks for employment).  NGI's improved workflow and technology infrastructure enable the system to accommodate increased civil checks and retain acceptable response time performance metrics.","On 02/25/2011, the FBI achieved IOC (Initial Operating Capability), Increment 1 for NGI.  IOC provides new advanced fingerprint matching algorithms, which provides improved accuracy rates.  This milestone occurred more than one month ahead of schedule and within the established cost threshold of $165 million.  Due to the improved accuracy, 910 additional candidates were identified during the first five days of the IOC that would not have been identified in the legacy system.  During the operational validation period, many identification successes were discovered, providing evidence of the NGI's superior performance.  IOC provided for the additional identification of subjects with criminal charges of murder in the first degree, manslaughter, assault on police, and felony abduction.  Additionally, NGI identified subjects during civil background investigations with prior charges including caregiver applicant battery and immigration applicant rape.","The following are planned accomplishments for FY12:-Design for full infrastructure, enhanced repository, facial recognition, RapBack, and interoperability.-Final Biometric Trade Study will be accepted by Government.-Develop Latent, Palm, rapid search for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and initial NGI workflow.-Acquire hardware and software supporting development of latent, palm, rapid search for CBP, and initial workflow.-Development of infrastructure to support transition of legacy IAFIS functionality and segments to NGI. -Development for transition of remaining legacy IAFIS.-Acquisition of hardware and software supporting development of full NGI infrastructure, enhanced repository, facial recognition, RapBack, and interoperability.-Complete re-programming of increments 3 and 4.The following are planned accomplishments for BY13:-Demonstrate Iris Recognition Capabilities via the Iris Pilot.-Deploy and perform post-deployment activities Latent, Palm, rapid search for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and initial NGI workflow.-Continue development of infrastructure to support transition of legacy IAFIS functionality and segments to NGI. -Continue development for transition of remaining legacy IAFIS.-Continue acquisition of hardware and software supporting development of full NGI infrastructure, enhanced repository, facial recognition, RapBack, and interoperability.",373.918,186.040432,220.49245299999998,152.193,2008.0,2018.0,The increases in FY2011 of $3482 and FY2012 of $3511 are due to a new calculation tool for the FTEs which more accurately aligns with other internal planning tools.,The contracts not mandating EVM provisions are for level of effort (Time and Material) services.

011-000003024,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The Law Enforcement National Data Exchange (N-DEx), comprised of the N-DEx system and the OneDOJ system, provides criminal justice agencies the ability to share data and detect, deter, and disrupt criminal activity and national security threats. N-DEx is the result of collaboration among local, county, state, tribal and federal criminal justice communities to establish a secure, national, criminal justice information sharing capability at the sensitive but unclassified level.  Ensuring that N-DEx meets the real-world needs of the criminal justice community has been identified as the key success factor. The application of N-DEx capabilities provides the missing links and creates partnerships that lead to more effective investigations that will help disrupt and apprehend individuals and organizations responsible for criminal activities and national security threats. The social value of N-DEx is an increased ability to protect citizens of the United States from criminal and terroristic threats.  The government has invested considerable funds and personnel resources to deliver the only national criminal justice information sharing system available. Criminal justice agencies across the nation have also made significant investments in order to participate with N-DEx. N-DEx establishes an information sharing network that as of December 31, 2011, contains over 127 million searchable records with more than 800 million entities (persons, places, things, and events) from over 4,300 agencies available to more than 38,000 users. In an era where information sharing is a critical mandate across the criminal justice community, the N-DEx system is well positioned and ready to efficiently and effectively serve criminal justice agencies for decades to come as the nationally-scaled information sharing system. N-DEx is the right information in the right hands, right now.","Information sharing is mission critical to today's public safety mandate. N-DEx closes the sharing gap and provides the solution for national information sharing by providing a secure, online system to the criminal justice community. Increment 1, deployed March 19, 2008, provided basic functionality and focused on incident and arrest data. Increment 2, deployed July 20, 2009, provided enhanced capability and capacity and the addition of incarceration and booking data. Increment 3, deployed March 17, 2011, provided a more intuitive user interface with an internet-type search, enhanced functionality, and the capability to add probation and parole data. The following success story demonstrates the power of information sharing.  N-DEx was recently used in Delaware to enhance officer safety and awareness, while protecting a woman and her children during a SWAT operation to arrest a homicide suspect. According to FBI Philadelphia sources, a suspect and two co-conspirators allegedly conducted a home invasion in Philadelphia, PA, in spring 2008.  During the home invasion the owner of the residence was shot and killed.  A suspect from the homicide was identified as one of the defendants in a subsequent Philadelphia Police Department investigation, and an arrest warrant was issued in the summer of 2011.  The FBI Philadelphia Violent Crimes Squad assisted in the investigation, and the name of the suspect was queried in N-DEx for additional information.  The N-DEx results indicated that the Wilmington, Delaware Police Department had contact with the suspect in 2010 regarding a domestic abuse case.  This information corroborated a possible home address for the suspect.  It also noted the possible presence of the suspect s wife and two small children.  The possibility that children may be present during the execution of the arrest warrant was relayed to case agents in the Philadelphia PD, Wilmington PD and FBI Wilmington RA.  A SWAT team executed the warrant and the suspect was arrested without incident in Wilmington, Delaware.  Currently, N-DEx is at a critical point in the process of data collection and system utilization. Considerable resources have been expended in order to arrive at the current status, and loss of future resources would greatly impact the ability to bring on additional agencies to participate in information sharing and reach the overall objective of information sharing at the national level.","The N-DEx Program Office released the final increment of the N-DEx system when Increment 3 went live on 3/17/11. The updated system provides users with results in a format similar to what they would see when using a commercial search engine. Improvements have been made to the Collaboration section making it easier for users to share files, work on documents, and discuss issues. In addition to the incident/case reports, arrest, incarceration and booking data contained in the previous increments, N-DEx can now accept probation and parole data and can handle more than 200 million records. Build 3.1 was deployed on 4/21/11 marking the completion of Increment 3. Build 3.2 was provided Audit improvements. Build 3.3 included data mapping enhancements. Build 3.4 brought search enhancements, ingest improvements, and Geo and Link Visualization improvements. Build 3.5.1 brought data sharing and access control enhancements.","In FY 2012 N-DEx will deliver:  Improved scalability, improved search results, additional data sharing controls, search enhancement, additional analytical tools, batch and subscription query.  In FY 2012 N-DEx will support up to 4,500 concurrent user sessions and up to 730 million searchable records. O&amp;M enhancements will provide near term and long term increase in data ingest throughput performance to meet current and future data ingest needs. In FY 2013 N-DEx will initiate a study to determine the Technical Refresh Implementation Plan.",242.552,42.334,42.281,50.99,2003.0,2017.0,"The funding level changes from the FY 2012 Presidents Budget Request result from adjustments to the actual totals for FY 2011 and adjustments to the internal application for resources for funds requested for FY 2012.

011-000002916,11,Department of Justice,10,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The Data Centers Project is the IT infrastructure that empowers the FBI to internally process information electronically and consists of 1) Modernization, periodic enhancement, and Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of installed computing platforms, and data storage devices, enterprise backup solutions, and a channel extension network; 2) Enhancements of existing hardware.  Without this project, the FBI would be unable to support an electronic environment in any form.  This would severely hinder the FBI's mission as the premier law enforcement agency in the U.S., not only the systems housed within the data centers, the FBI Agents and the support personnel to perform their missions, but the United States as a whole.  The Data Centers have been in operation since the 1960's and will continue for as long as the FBI exists.  The Data Center project is an on-going, iterative process, constantly monitoring key metrics such as processor usage; response times; bandwidth usage between Data Centers; environmental data; and participating in planning events for new/modified projects which are planned to be installed within the Data Centers for operations and maintenance.  New purchases of hardware and services or process reengineering are initiated through the budget process based on metric projections.  Occasionally, events occur which propel the metrics to a higher level, necessitating the need of emergency funding, especially when requested funding was denied during the normal budgetary process.  The Data Centers are using the Virtual Machine (VM) technology with a LINUX platform to consolidate small, underutilized servers.  Additional resources are planned for purchases as servers are migrated to this technology.  Additional investment in server consolidation is planned for several reasons: ease of relocating the data center, lower power and cooling, and space requirements; reduction in labor to manage the hardware; and creation of offsite backup images.","The JEH Data Center was constructed over 35 years ago from an area that wasn't intended to be a data center.  The power demands and growth experienced by advancing technology have been maximized at the current data center location.  Data center technology needs to consist of a modern, standardized IT infrastructure, including an enterprise hosting environment that supports virtualization, remote access, a &quot;lights out&quot; operational posture and &quot;green&quot; technologies.  The FBI Data Center relocation is designed to address current facility, power, and security performance deficiencies as well as provide long term cost savings.  The existing data center at JEH had performance gaps in space utilization, power and cooling demands, and O&amp;M requirements.  There were also security concerns due to its location and lack of sufficient Continuity of Operations (COOP) capabilities.Relocating the Data Center addresses these gaps by:- Decreasing the threat levels associated with current locations- Lowering power and cooling costs- Reduces labor costs- Decreases facilities cost per square foot- Providing sufficient space to consolidate multiple smaller Data Centers- Accommodating Continuity of Operations (COOP) capabilities for numerous &quot;single threaded&quot; systems without COOP capability- Allowing for planned growth- Eliminating limitations on available data center power that were constraining data center growthIn the event that the Data Centers project is not fulfilled, we would not be able to meet the President's mandate on reducing data centers.  The data center would not be able to efficiently manage the FBI's IT infrastructure.","FY2011Establishment of Site 73             Designed, built, certified and made operational the new data center at Site 73.Development of the Virtual Application Systems Environment for virtualization of existing systems.

012-000005013,12,Department of Labor,12,Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,"The IT Infrastructure Investment provides services to 2,300 PBGC FTEs & contractors at the Washington, DC HQ & a dozen adjunct locations.  Of equal importance is the investment's support of the use of Internet-based technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to interact with the Federal Government, save taxpayer dollars, and streamline citizen participation, as defined by OMB's Office of E-Government & Information Technology.  The investment supports PBGC's strategic goals by providing the foundation for all business applications including MyPBA, which allows pensioners to use the Internet to manage their PBGC benefit, and MyPAA, which allows those companies sponsoring defined benefit pension plans to comply with the mandate to file premiums electronically. PBGC cannot accomplish its mission without automated tools & business software, which require the underlying infrastructure. All other PBGC Exhibit 300 investments depend on this one for their IT environments and tools. Since inception, the investment has been beset by two dependent factors: (1) An unprecedented increase in workloads in the early 2000s caused (2) infrastructure to be implemented (to meet the workload demands) in an inefficient, unplanned manner without respect to the CPIC & budgeting cycles which resulted in duplicative systems & functionality, each requiring separate but interdependent support structures.  Because these factors resulted in an IT infrastructure that is too large, too complex & too expensive, the performance gap is the continued ability to provide an IT foundation in a stable, cost-effective way. Further, the PBGC IG has reported three significant deficiencies which, when combined, form a material weakness in PBGC's internal controls. Two deficiencies - enterprise security program & access controls/configuration management - apply directly to this investment. The performance gap will be closed using a three prong approach. PBGC will fund the current enterprise-wide security corrective action plan (CAP) from the existing agency budget. The CAP is the oversight mechanism for curing the relevant significant deficiencies. Secondly, PBGC will analyze and implement  recommendations of the IT Infrastructure Alternatives Analysis, completed in May, 2011.  Finally, PBGC will engage in a comprehensive upgrade of Oracle database management software, properly configured to address relevant security concerns.","This investment has closed, and continues to close, the identified performance gap -  for all mission delivery and management support areas - of needing a robust, stable IT environment in which to deploy and use automated business tools and corporate applications.  The investment itself has an identified performance gap in that, while it does provide the support all other PBGC IT investment needs, it does so in a cumbersome, labor and cost intensive fashion that is neither efficient nor agile.  The method for closing this performance gap is detailed above.  The impact to PBGC's overall ability to accomplish its mission - if this investment is not fully funded - would depend on the final funding level.  If the investment's funding is reduced by 15% or more, PBGC's ability to accomplish its mission will be seriously jeopardized.  A funding reduction of that level would cut into this investment's ability to provide the foundation for all the Corporation's business applications.  A reduction in capacity would be necessary in a major technical domain, such as database operations or networking, as a result of a 15% or greater funding reduction.  A funding reduction of 5 to 15% would prevent the investment from implementing the recommendations of the IT Infrastructure Alternatives Analysis.  These recommendations generally point to directions and methodologies that would allow this investment to transfer to a much less capital intensive service model that would be more efficient and more agile.  Cutting this funding would essentially be only a short-term gain.  If this investment does not shift, rationally and expeditiously, to a new model, it will require significant new capital investment to renew and replace the current Government-owned infrastructure components.  Implementing the AA recommendations will lead to a lower cost model based on Federal lines of business and Federally-approved innovations such as cloud computing.","Completed $36M of direct, regular and on-going IT infrastructure operations and maintenance support to PBGC in areas such as database operations, local and wide area networking, desktop support, software and hardware maintenance agreement renewal and the like.

The investment supports PBGC's strategic goals by providing the foundation for all business applications.  Improvements to PBGC's IT infrastructure are a work in progress. In FY2009, and reiterated again in FY2010, audits revealed deficiencies in security controls resulting in a reversal of decision to fully outsource all infrastructure. Several efforts are underway to fix deficiencies: (1) a long term corrective action plan for security control remediation is in progress, (2) a new alternative analysis for infrastructure is complete and planning is underway for execution of recommendations, (3) corporate level discussions on reducing IT's footprint are underway and (4) the General Support Systems' Security Assessment and Authorization is complete and signed in early May 2011.

012-000005005,12,Department of Labor,12,Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,"Benefit Calculation & Valuation System (BCVS), PBGC's system in development to value and calculate benefits, will be used by plan actuaries to determine participant benefits and calculate corporate liabilities for plans PBGC will trustee, by benefit administrators to calculate actual retirement benefits for our existing 1.5M participants in some 4,200 trusteed plans & by plan participants via MyPBA for online self-service benefit estimates for most current & all future plan participants. BCVS calculations are essential to determining eligibility & correct benefit amounts for participants entering pay status (PBGC currently pays participants approx. $4.4B annually) & serve as liability data for corporate financial statements & thus supports the agency's mission of protecting the retirement incomes of 44M American workers in defined benefit pension plans. The goal is to modernize the BCV core systems allowing PBGC to close performance gaps & meet its strategic goals by retiring antiquated technology, reducing security issues, incorporating re-engineered processes, & integrating with other systems namely those included in the Participant Services Benefit Administration (BA) Investment while collaborating with IT Infrastructure thus establishing dependencies between these Investments. The BCVS performance based contract was awarded in September 2010 and the long-term BCV solution will be delivered in a phased approach, approx 5 1/2 years, an optimal development sequence from a cost & risk perspective. Phase I of BCVS will be available for use the later part of 2012. BCV includes Steady State costs of Ariel (until decommissioned), ACT/Archive (current systems) & DME costs for BCVS through FY17. Major risks with the current systems include: inability to meet PBGC strategic goals; risk of security breaches; inability to sustain legacy ACT/Archive applications; inability to address findings in the Inspector General (IG) Report No. 2010-9/IT-09-67; inability to address improvement areas documented in the 2010 Benefit Determination (BD) Segment Architecture.","Our current Benefit Calculation applications ACT and Archive present a number of challenges that will be resolved with BCVS.  BCVS will be developed over a 5  year period providing new technology and a blend of functionality to be delivered in multiple phases. Challenges with unsecure PII data distributed across desktops and remote locations; architecture that is not scalable nor easily extensible; inability to integrate with other systems without manual intervention; client based applications that are dependent upon specific tools, technology and desk configurations; products that are at or near their end of service life resulting in rework; and the inability to satisfy all strategic goals will be addressed. High priority performance gaps documented in the 2010 Benefit Determination Segment Architecture include: no availability of online retirement estimates for non-Ariel plans, our former primary benefit calculation system; data collection process often gives incomplete results which in turn impacts benefit determinations; insufficient tracking of corrections and verification review efforts; limited reuse of calculation logic among plans; and exposure of PII data on local/shared drives at headquarters as well as offsite locations. The proposed BCVS addresses each of these challenges with a single application and satisfies all strategic goals therefore addressing the abovementioned performance gaps in addition to the 36 improvement areas documented in the 2010 BD Segment Architecture; strategic goals of accessing critical systems through reliable, adaptable, and secure information technology, efficient operational processes, procedures, and systems that have capacity to handle variable workloads; timely, accurate, and responsive customer service and self-service tools; and compliance with laws and regulations through program evaluations and management accountability; and security findings in Inspector General (IG) Report No. 2010-9/IT-09-67 which includes a recommendation that BAPD (Benefits Administration & Payment Department): fully evaluate the risk associate with continued usage of ACT, and document the evaluation;  re-evaluate and classify Actuarial Calculation Toolkit (ACT) and complete a security Accreditation and Authorization (A&A); and conduct scanning on a periodic basis in accordance with NIST guidance and best business practices.","Prior year completions include: The ACT-Archive 6.0/6.1 Projects consisted of three (3) deployments that included an upgrade to MS Excel 2007; continuous eligibility interface changes; optional form annuity programming capability; and the conversion/update of 802 legacy cases from outdated technology to MS technology. For our previous system, Ariel, we converted all plans to the current benefit calculation system (ACT) resulting in a uniform benefit calculation platform for all plans. We also completed a plan for disposition of PBGC data allowing for the termination of the ASP contract with the Ariel provider.  The BCVS Planning Phase was executed from October 2010 thru April 2011. This time period was used to study, analyze, and understand PBGC's IT and business environment and formulate three (3) options for the design/development of the new BCVS.  BCVS Phase I began in May 2011. We are currently in the development phase.","BCVS Phase 1 will be developed and deployed in Current Year (CY) 2012 and will reduce security issues, introduce audit trails, and support the PBGC strategic objectives by increasing participant online transactions namely online retirement estimates. Details of this release include the process of closing performance gaps by retiring antiquated technology; a secure portal for prior plan administrators to upload plan/participant documents; a Virtual Client Platform serving as a secure centralized location for users to access the BCVS applications (data); a web-based tool for benefit administrators to run participants' recalculations; and integration with MyPBA for online retirement estimate generation for plan participants.  In addition, the Ariel application will be decommissioned.

In July 2010, the Benefit Calculation and Valuation investment team completed the Segment Architecture for the investment.  In September 2010, a performance based contract was awarded which kicked off the planning phase efforts.  The purpose of the planning phase was to form an Integrated Project Team (IPT) to study, analyze and evaluate PBGC's current IT and business environment, review existing documentation (prior alternative analysis, segment architecture recommendations, etc.) and determine three viable options to implement the recommended alternative (long-term solution).  The IPT completed the planning phase and recommended a long-term solution (the selective alternative) that will be implemented in a phased approach.  PBGC has approved the BCV long-term solution that will address the performance gaps and the recommendations identified from our segment architecture.  The BCV solution addresses the security findings, technology issues, consolidates and integrates with other applications, accounts for both legacy and new plans, reduces the number of legacy applications and meets the strategic goals. The analysis of the alignment of the prior alternative analysis with the segment architecture recommendations and the planning phase options analysis was also completed. The results confirmed the alternative analysis selected alternative. The focus of the investment for the remainder of FY2011 through FY2012 is to complete the development and implementation of the first phase of the long-term BCV solution.

012-000001075,12,Department of Labor,20,Bureau of Labor Statistics,"The NCS System directly supports the Secretary of Labor's Vision of Good Jobs for Everyone.  In particular, it supports Department of Labor (DOL) Strategic Goal 5, to produce timely and accurate data on the economic conditions of workers and their families, and DOL Outcome Goal 5.1, to provide sound and impartial information on labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy for decision making, including support for the formulation of economic and social policy affecting virtually all Americans.The NCS System is necessary to produce and release the Nation's primary source of compensation data.  The NCS provides comprehensive measures of occupational earnings, compensation cost trends, benefit incidence, and detailed benefit provisions.  It publishes local, regional, and national compensation data.  The Employment Cost Index (ECI), a Principal Federal Economic Indicator (PFEI), is used by the Federal Reserve in monetary policy decision making.  The index also measures quarterly changes in total compensation in the civilian economy.  The Employee Benefits Survey (EBS) provides comprehensive data on the incidence and provisions of employee benefit plans in private industry and State and local governments.The NCS utilizes the following BLS investments: &quot;BLS - Internet Data Collection Facility (IDCF)&quot; (UII 012-000003425); &quot;BLS - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) Systems&quot; (UII 012-000003115), &quot;BLS - Current Employment Statistics (CES) Maintenance&quot; (UII 012-000003005), and &quot;BLS - Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Systems&quot; (UII 012-000003085) for benchmarking and/or weight derivation; and &quot;BLS LABSTAT Maintenance&quot; (UII 012-000003055) for data dissemination via the Internet.  Also, the NCS relies on the bureau-wide BLS LAN/WAN infrastructure that is part of the &quot;DOL - Agencies' General Support Systems&quot; (UII 012-000003605) investment. In 2011, the BLS implemented an alternative approach to the Locality Pay Surveys (LPS) component of the NCS.  By using data from two current BLS programs, the OES survey and the ECI, this new approach can be used to extend the estimation of pay gaps to areas that are not in the LPS sample, allowing for additional high quality data at a lower cost.","In the past, the ECI and EBS were produced by separate systems with similar components, creating redundancies.  The NCS closed this performance gap by consolidating the two data products to create a modern IT system that provided objective, timely, accurate, and relevant compensation statistics to the public.  This one integrated IT system more efficiently supports multiple program outputs including ECI, Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC), Detailed Provisions and Employee Benefits in the United States.In the event of a significant funding shortfall or long-term continuing resolution, the BLS may be required to delay or defer planned maintenance tasks and deliverables.  This may have a detrimental impact on the collection, production, and timely release of the NCS.The continued operation and maintenance of the NCS System is necessary to efficiently and effectively support the collection, production, and timely release of the NCS.  Without proper maintenance, the NCS would be unable to keep its data current and would not be able to properly measure changing compensation trends.  Without ongoing operation and support, the NCS System would run on unsupported software and be at risk for being unable to produce important economic indicators, such as the ECI, on time.  Without a properly secure environment, confidential data could be at risk of unauthorized release.","Major investment accomplishments in FY 2011 include:- Completed all quarterly NCS releases, as scheduled. - Made updates to PATCO System to change the model methodology in order to support the implementation of the alternative approach to the LPS.  - Made updates to Benefit Estimation Systems to support 2011 Incidence and Key Provisions and Detailed Provision Estimates for FY 2011.- Made updates to RECAP System to incorporate Benefits.- Updated Sampling system to support NCS National Design.",Planned major accomplishments for FY 2012 and FY 2013 include:- Complete all quarterly NCS releases per FY 2012 and FY 2013 schedules. - Make updates to Benefit Estimation Systems in FY 2012 to produce estimates for health care benefits of State and local government workers. - Update NCS Data Collection Application in FY 2012 to expand ability to collect benefits data electronically. - Update NCS Data Collection Application in FY 2012 to improve the processes for maintaining respondent contact information.- Update NCS Data Collection Application in FY 2012 to support North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2012 and improve data timeliness and accuracy.- Continue to maintain infrastructure in FY 2013 to support the needs of the NCS program.- Continue to perform ongoing upgrades in FY 2013 for the timely and accurate release of the quarterly ECI data.,55.935,6.538,5.702,5.735,2002.0,2017.0,The Summary of Funding table projections in FY 2011 are revised from the FY 2012 President's Budget request to reflect the delayed implementation of the alternative approach to the Locality Pay Surveys in FY 2011.,"The task orders for this Steady State investment do not require EVM; however, they are performance-based to reduce the risk to the Government.

The tools and techniques associated with DEBS permit users to track, report and analyze budget and performance data within agency and across DOL for greater transparency. The solution, available on the internet, automates the budget formulation and publication process through easy-to-use technology. DEBS is designed to enable and empower the budget community to seamlessly produce budget submissions, respond to stakeholder inquiries and analyze budget against plan. DEBS alleviates the laborious efforts associated with producing multiple budget submissions on cuff records, disparate worksheets and non-uniform templates. As the system of budet formulation for all DOL agencies, DEBS is preparing to support external Federal agencies under the concept of Shared Services Provider (SSP) as recognized by the Budget Formulation and Execution Line of Business (BFELoB). DEBS will capitalize on the automated budget submission process and integrate and interoperate with internal/external systems thereby helping the Department recover sunk costs. This framework is already capable of serving external federal agencies and will be improved upon to support a SSP model. During FY12 DEBS will continue O&M related to EA and IT Security and provide monthly updates as per CPIC guidelines.","In FY12 DEBS will address the following performance gaps:Inconsistent, non-repeatable budget formulation process - Manual, repetitive and time intensive budget formulation process resulting in delinquent, inconsistent, error-prone budget submissions to OMB and Congress.Inefficiencies in budget formulation - The existing budget formulation process contains inefficiencies due to semi-manual process associated with recording budget details in multiple disparate MS Excel and Word files located on shared drives.Lack of resource availability for budget analysis, customer service and reporting   DOL's legacy, manual budgeting process is resource intensive and causes a lack of resource availability for budget analysis, customer service and reporting. Budget process standardization and automation is necessary to make resources available for customer service and analysis.Lack of centralized and secure database - The lack of centralized and secure database, complemented by a collaborative, workflow-driven, user-friendly automated interface, diminishes collaboration on budget and planning matters which impacts the continuity of operations across DOL.Inconsistent definition and organization of budget data entities - DOL is not consistent, across its Agencies, in its definition and organization of budget data entities. This inconsistency results in internal inefficiencies in budget formulation, consolidation and analysis; and it creates difficulty in aligning the budget with strategic goals.DME funding for CY12 is required to deliver three major modules. First, near real time interoperability with DOL s accounting and financial management system (New Core Financial Management System - NCFMS), MAX, DOL's electronic solution for accessing core personnel information - Webpars, and DOL's timesheet system for federal employees - People time. Second, it will also address user interface reporting requirements for workflow, apportionment tracking and appropriation language review by and between OMB and DOL.

OIS will consist of a suite of applications that will strengthen OSHA's business processes for enforcement, compliance assistance, and consultation. Also, OIS will align with the Department of Labor (DOL) Secretary's vision of Good Jobs for Everyone. It will benefit all workers and employers by: 1) Securing safe and healthy workplaces, particularly in high-risk industries; 2) Ensuring workers voice in the workplace; 3) Incorporating open standards middleware to facilitate data integration from Federal OSHA, State OSHA Plans, State Consultation Programs, and OSHA Laboratory business processes; and 4) Using analytical tools that will enable OSHA to identify trends in injuries, fatalities, and illnesses; provide visibility into work populations with the highest risk of injury/illness; enable OSHA to place resources where they are needed most; and to produce reports necessary to manage day-to-day operations.  In addition, OIS will be used by 2,300 Federal employees of which 1,100 are enforcement staff; 26 State OSHA Programs with 3,100 enforcement staff/users; Consultation programs in 50 states with 500 safety/health consultants; and investigative assistance employees enforcing Whistleblower complaints and Sarbanes Oxley reprisal investigations.","OIS will allow OSHA to close current performance gaps including the: 1) Antiquated legacy Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) system's hardware and software; 2) Inability of legacy IMIS to fully support the DOL/OSHA strategic plan and consequently OSHA Mission; 3) Absence of an application that supports key business processes; and 4) Inability of the legacy IMIS to provide management the tools to recognizing trends in occupational fatalities and injuries/illnesses. The performance gaps will be closed using OIS's analytical tools enabling OSHA to recognize trends and place resources in the right places. OIS will dispose of the 1992 hardware for which there are no longer replacement parts and the software that lacks functionality for management reporting and analysis, a critical need. OIS will also support OSHA's business areas including the recently announced significant policy changes: an alteration in the way penalties are calculated that will result in increased employer fines, the new Severe Violator Enforcement Program, as well as the Homeland Security/Emergency Response.  If OIS is not fully funded, OSHA will be unable to complete the migration of IMIS from the NCR platform, leaving IMIS users critically exposed to irreplaceable hardware failures.  OSHA will be unable to produce accurate reports to track its business effectiveness; state plans will be unable to meet their OSHA reporting obligations or support their own OSHA programs; and penalty payments will not be able to be collected or transferred to Treasury.","The OIS investment accomplished the following activities in the Prior Year:- Completed the OIS Authority to Operate (ATO) .- Deployed OIS Enforcement and Consultation to Federal Offices in Regions 5, 8, 9 and 10. - Instantiated the OIS Production Environment at the US Department of Agriculture National Information Technology Center (NITC). - Trained over 1,000 users via virtual training and webinars.- Trained approximately 60 Consultation superusers in Instructor-Led Training (ILT) classes.- Trained approximately 20 Enforcement superusers in the first of five ILT classes for Enforcement.","The following accomplishments are planned.- Deploy Enforcement module to Regions 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7.- Deploy OIS Enforcement and Consultation modules to State Plan States.  - Build and release additional iterations and update functionality.- Conduct training for Federal and State Users.- Develop interface between Washington State and OIS.- Complete migration of historical data from mainframe to OIS.- Maintain OIS user technical helpdesk.",58.134965,15.971973,10.780974,8.06405,2005.0,2016.0,"O&amp;M costs for CY12 have increased from $3592K to $6366K and the DME costs increased from $0 to $3500K.

AMS will provide efficient and transparent procurement management capabilities for the acquisition of goods and services across the full acquisition life cycle from planning to contract closeout that is consistent with public law, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) policies and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates, and key business and performance requirements for the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to achieve its strategic mission. The secure cloud computing based system enables DOL to focus on managing its Acquisition processes rather than its Acquisition system and related technologies, avoiding the costs associated with updating and supporting its legacy Electronic Procurement System (EPS), and improving the responsiveness of its procurement organization. This investment benefits the public by enabling DOL to support delivery of essential mission-driven citizen services through accountable and transparent procurement of a wide array of products and services in order to achieve its strategic goals. The AMS will fully integrate with the existing DOL internal systems including New Core Financial Management System (NCFMS) and Electronic Grants Management System (e-Grants), new DOL systems such as the Contractor Personnel System (CPS) and Identity and Access Management (IAM), and external Systems for Award Management (SAM) formerly known as Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) Systems.","Following OMB strategic guidance on evaluating cloud computing alternative pursuant to the BY12 budget process as well as, the new directives from United States Chief Information Officer in his 25 Point Implementation Plan, plus OMB Director's Memorandum on Chief Information Officer Authorities, released on August 11, 2011, DOL is pursuing a cloud computing based solution to replace its existing legacy Electronic Procurement System (EPS). The current legacy Electronic Procurement System (EPS) integrates with only two of the eight Systems for Award Management (SAM) component systems. It consists of two different COTS products (for Requisitions and Contracts) provided by two different vendors, hence not providing DOL with a single accountability for resolving technical or help desk issues and addressing new requirements while it is increasingly prone to errors and failures. There are also significant interface failures between EPS with DOL Grants Management System and New Core Financial Management System (NCFMS) resulting in financial data not being captured properly in NCFMS causing Lapse of Funds Issues. Dramatic increases in rework and errors in the documents and Government-wide reporting makes the EPS investment benefits no longer viable. Successful closure of these major performance gaps is the primary goal of this investment. In addition, AMS is aiming for a significant increase in system's availability and user satisfaction as well as a decrease in average number of help desk calls per users. Furthermore, the system security vulnerabilities are to be reduced by a significant amount. If the investment does not get fully funded, then most likely some or all of these gaps will stay open and as is.","* Completed the development of the preliminary set of requirements.* Completed the development of the Request for Quote (RFQ).* Completed the technical and cost evaluation of the proposals.* Completed the development and update of the SDLC documents for SDLC phase 1 and 2, including: Project Charter, Statement of Concept, Cost Benefit Analysis, Risk Management Plan, Project Management Plan, Risk Register, Acquisition Plan, and Quality Management Plan.","The following accomplishments are planned using $2.0M of PY11 carry-over funds plus $7.0M of CY12 funds plus $2.0M of BY13 funds: * Conduct Post-Award Integrated Baseline Review with the selected vendor.* Complete the set up and configuration of the development environment.* Conduct detailed requirements and gap analysis and resolve issues to close identified gaps.* Conduct data migration activities and assessment.* Complete set up and configuration of the training environment.

Phase 1 (PIV-I, October 2005), began with the establishment of independently certified identity proofing processes to ensure employees and contractors received current fingerprint checks and appropriate valid background investigations.  Phase 2 (PIV-II, October 2006) required and resulted in the deployment of electronic systems to manage the identity proofing life cycle sponsorship, electronic document capture and validation, biometric scan and electronic submission to OPM, electronic PIV Card generation, and PKI data encoding. With resounding success, DOL has issued PIV cards to over 95% eligible employees and contractors. Accomplishment of the initial two phases established the baseline to launch the Departments Phase 3 compliance project, to implement use of the PIV card in logical (LACS) and physical (PACS) access control systems. Both LACS and PACS rely on authoritative unique digital identities, to effectively operate when rapid electronic authentication decisions are required, for technology and facility access. This requirement comprises the goal for stage one of Phase 3 in the deployment of an enterprise-wide identity access management (IAM) utility service. We are currently establishing a central DOL Contractor Personnel System (CPS); creating a utility service for provisioning and de-provisioning digital identities to all agencies' GSS for all DOL staff; and integrating account management services through IAM. Critical added value will be achieved through implementation of: integration of all agencies networks and applications (AMS, HR-SSC, etc.) for identity authentication; enabling single sign-on for reducing or eliminating the need for multiple user ids and passwords; enabling efficient and secure account management decisions, creation, change, and revocation; complying with audit findings for securing agencies access to data stores; and providing reliable federation services for outside authorized constituent access.","Current gaps/challenges:The Department of Labor needs to fulfill the mission of the HSPD-12 Program in order to be compliant with OMB Directives (e.g., M11-11) and Homeland Security Presidential Directive.  The lack of a reliable identity asset management solution brings several challenges and risks to the organization, including: compromised security due to inconsistencies among DOL agencies and systems; long wait time for new hires and contractors to do their jobs; long and cumbersome onboarding processes; fragmented identity databases and authentication mechanisms; lengthy delays for enabling access to agency IT resources; multiple passwords for users to manage; risk of compromised security for accounts that have been forgotten. Lack of compliance with Federal mandates will result in: 1. Identity information hosted in many different systems resulting in duplication, inconsistencies, and vulnerabilities 2. Lack of access to authoritative trusted identity data sources 3. Inefficiencies due to lengthy and non-standard onboarding and off boarding processes 4. Security risks introduced by variable methods of authentication 5. Unreliable authentication to DOL resource by remote and regional users.Goals: 1. Leverage IAM capabilities to achieve financial, operational and business benefits for DOL 2. Manage the digital identities of DOL staff and partners with the use of identity management capabilities 3. Allow identification and access to required logical and physical resources by DOL employees and contractors through a single, trusted credential.  IAM and LACS Programs will enhance secure access to trusted data sources, improve ITC processes, and increase staff productivity 4. Provide self-services capabilities that allow automated user account management 5. Enable secure cross-agency information sharing affording easy portability via federation.  IAM will eliminate internal barriers to accessing Department information through reduced sign-on, and data federation, resulting in improved data sharing between ITC and other agencies and offices that will allow more timely delivery of services to customers 6. Deploy an integrated logical and physical access management capability across DOL 7. Realize cost savings for DOL, reducing overall pressure on the Department budget and allowing funds to be repurposed for additional mission support work 8.

012-000003585,12,Department of Labor,25,Departmental Management,"The Office of the Solicitor (SOL) ensures that the Nation's labor laws are forcefully and fairly applied to protect the Nation's workers. It currently lacks the technology to keep up with an increasing workload. Not only is its caseload increasing, but cases today involve an increasing amount of electronic data. The evidence management portion of this investment marries the enforcement (inspection) business processes of client enforcement agencies with the legal services (litigation) business processes of SOL by providing electronic sharing of common evidence documents and automating manual litigation support processes. The matter management portion of this investment supports resource management of the delivery of legal services to ensure that legal services deadlines established by the Federal court and client program agencies are met and also supports compliance with appropriation guidelines and performance management targets. During FY11, SOL continued development and testing of Phase 1 of the Matter Management Initiative. Additionally, SOL completed the initial requirements analysis, detailed cost benefit analysis and the solicitation development for the Evidence Management Initiative.   The overall benefit to the government and to the citizens will be in the form of more efficient management of labor law cases and litigation through the improved capabilities provided to DOL's attorneys and legal staff.","The fundamental business problem is that SOL IT and litigation support continues to operate using paper-based, manual processes in an industry that has long embraced the use of technology to improve the effectiveness of legal representation.  This project will close legacy system performance gaps including limited electronic sharing of common evidential data, lack of centralized access to geographically disbursed evidence information, manual paper-based manipulation of evidence, outdated legacy system technology that cannot keep pace with the volume and variety of evidence file formats or the technology utilized by opposing counsel, and the inability to respond to recent regulatory changes in the Federal Rules of Civil procedure regarding e-discovery.  In the absence of the proper e-discovery tools, SOL cannot effectively compete with even the smallest commercial law firms (opposing counsel) that use technology as a force multiplier to vigorously represent their clients in litigation against the Department.  In many cases, SOL cannot effectively process electronic evidence information (e.g., OSHA and MSHA inspection reports) related to enforcement actions of program agencies.  Noncompliance with regulations related to the handling and preservation of electronic media is at high risk.  The continued use of SOL's current manual processes results in attorney and staff frustration, decline in morale, and most importantly risks ineffective legal representation. In order to provide effective services to the Secretary and Department, SOL must update its current legal technology infrastructure and greatly expand its inadequate legal technology services to remain effective in our enforcement actions and in litigation and regulatory activities.  The technology-based tools provided by the IT Modernization Initiative will allow SOL to process more complex and ground-breaking enforcement cases resulting in better protection of the rights of American workers.  In accordance with the &quot;Cloud First&quot; policy from OMB's 25 Point Plan to Reform Federal IT Management, this project aims to implement a cloud-based solution to provide a secure, reliable, cost-effective application for managing litigation evidence.  Failure to fund this investment will severely hamper the Department's ability to handle anticipated workload, thus reducing the effectiveness of protecting the rights of American workers as economic, financial, and global competition impacts the workplace.","For the Matter Management Initiative (MMI), the design and development of Phase 1 of the Matter Management System (MMS) included creation of the following: - User interface- Business rules- Time management- System security- Reporting- Integration into the DOL environment - Successful data conversion tests using legacy application data.Evidence Management Initiative (EMI) accomplishments include:- Completion of market research and analysis- Completion of Cost Benefit Analysis for cloud-hosted alternatives- Development of  procurement materials- Review of RFI responses in preparation for award.","For the Matter Management Initiative (MMI), current and budget year activities include:  - Final integration into the DOL network environment (development, user acceptance, quality assurance, production)- Final User Acceptance Testing (UAT)- Final IV&amp;V validation of data conversion and management reporting functionality- Obtain ATO- Schedule and roll-out new application with on-site training nationwide- Decommission legacy applications- Implement change control policy- Deliver Legislative Project Tracking System Capability- Deliver Wage and Hour Database Replacement Capability- Create additional management reports and explore email and calendar integration (Budget Year)These activities build upon the system foundation created in prior investment years, and will allow SOL to reap the business improvement benefits that the system provides.    Specifically, the implementation and launch of this system will allow SOL to analyze the volume, diversity, trends, and impact of the workload in SOL divisions and field offices.  The information it provides will also allow SOL to more effectively manage resources, monitor and improve performance, and provide client agencies with valuable information about their programs.

DFEC is charged by Congress to provide benefits to civilian employees of the Federal Government injured or made ill at work, and to certain other designated groups covered by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). Benefits include wage replacement, payment for medical care, and medical and vocational rehabilitation assistance in returning to work. iFECS enables claims adjudication and wage-loss compensation. DFEC aligns with Federal, Departmental, and Agency strategic goals. As part of the Secretary's good jobs for everyone vision, iFECS facilitates income support when work is impossible due to work-related illness.Funding was approved for FY10 to modernize iFECS with the Fair Share initiative to implement: Interactive Voice Response (IVR), E-Compensation Management Portal (Ecomp), and Centralized Case Create &amp; Imaging (3Ci) operations. Due to delayed apportionment and procurement much of the work was delayed to FY11. With agreement from OCIO, the initiative joined the DOL's EVM program in October 2010 and is currently deploying usable components. OWCP/DFEC received approval for FY 2012 funding of $1.2 million to implement the mandated ICD-10 medical diagnosis coding schema. Unfortunately when funds were appropriated via a Continuing Resolution, this funding was lost. Therefore OWCP/DFEC will have to proceed with this upgrade out of existing funds. This will drastically affect its implementation plan which has had to descope large portions of the project. Also the project will be delayed until FY 2013.  However, without this vital update, iFECS will not be able to process medical benefit payments estimated at over $800M.","The proposed Fair Share Initiative improvements will facilitate sorely needed direct electronic communication between DFEC and its customer agencies.  Currently, if a customer agency wants to receive interim information about its organization's claims a dedicated connection between the two agencies must be established via a lengthy and at-cost process, or request a CD to be mailed.  While this allows agencies to see the information on a monthly basis, real-time electronic access to the data will improve the customer agencies abilities to manage their compensation claims and their budgets. ECOMP 2.0 will allow claimants to view previously-submitted adjudicatory evidence and to review other compensation claim files. Currently claimants must travel to a District Office to review their compensation claim files.Failure to fund the iFECS request will prevent DFEC from implementing better on-line communication with its customers and preventing or reducing the impact of payment errors.  Failure to conduct the ICD-10 migration will prevent the compensation system from being able to pay medical benefits.",By the end of FY11 DFEC will have deployed the following useful components:- Modernized IVR implemented in all offices.- Case create and imaging consolidated from 13 to two offices.- ECOMP Web Portal developed and released to provide electronic claims initiation and supporting documentation uploading free of charge to Federal employing agencies via the Web.,"In FY 2012 DFEC will:  - Analysis, design, and begin coding for ICD-10 Maintenance release - Deploy regular maintenance releases for ECOMP and iFECS to include expanding ECOMP to include OSHA and the other three OWCP programs.In FY 2013:- Complete and deploy ICD-10 Maintenance release- Regular maintenance releases will be deployed for ECOMP and iFECS.",182.472,18.921,18.921,19.285,1985.0,2020.0,The funding for ICD-10 was not allocated in the FY12 funds.,"For the DME portions of the project, as contracts and task orders are let for this work EVM is included in those contracts. iFECS joined the DOL EVM program as of October 2010.

DITIM indirectly supports the Secretary of Labor's vision of Good Jobs for Everyone by providing a reliable, efficient, and available infrastructure that enhances agencies' ability to fulfill their missions and to allow citizens to effectively communicate with DOL. Transforming the DOL IT Infrastructure to a uniform, consistent configuration, will enable: strategic initiatives to improve overall customer service to the public; provide a more homogeneous, consistent approach for business service delivery; provide opportunities for agency IT staff to focus more on their mission to improve specific business applications; and produce agency savings that can be reinvested in business process improvement projects. DITIM will: modernize technology to enhance productivity and program performance; measure results; reduce administrative costs; increase accessibility to customers and stakeholders; and remove redundant and inefficient services. DOL will exploit enterprise IT solutions and services that are available through the use of cloud computing. Enterprise IT services DITIM will modernize or incorporate include email, online collaboration, document management, records management, eDiscovery, and remote access. DITIM will also implement enterprise solutions for mandated infrastructure changes such as data center consolidation, trusted Internet connection, and IPv6. The DITIM investment also manages the operations and maintenance of previous projects that were previously reported under the Department of Labor Infrastructure Optimization (DIO) investment.","DOL's IT footprint consists of nine independent IT infrastructures, with varying degrees of maturity and obsoleteness. If DITIM is not fully funded a siloed, duplicative, and inefficient architecture that hamstrings DOL's ability to better serve its internal and external customers will persist.  DITIM will transform DOL's IT organization and infrastructure, changing its orientation from one focused on technology implementation to one that provisions and manages IT services. The DITIM program conducted a Listening Tour to gather feedback on IT issues that hamper the business from efficiently achieving its goals. Some of the concerns and gaps in IT services discovered include: limited mobile and remote access; challenges to email usage, storage, archiving, and missing functionality; lack of collaboration tools; access to video teleconferencing equipment; insufficient end user training; inconsistent service desk support; and lack of user involvement in IT development. The primary directive of the investment is using IT strategically to modernize DOL's infrastructure and support project-oriented investments that will demonstrably improve program performance and contribute to achieving the Secretary s outcome goals.   The following describes the current DITIM projects which address issues with DOL's current infrastructure environment. DITIM plans to initiate additional projects to address the remaining gaps. The Data Center Consolidation Initiative (DCCI) project address inefficiencies associated with data centers spread out across the country. The project consists of three strategies.  DCCI Strategy I will first focus on consolidating the National Office data centers at first, then Strategies II and III focus on the regional offices and remote offices.The Email-as-a-Service (EaaS) project will transition nine separate email environments into one enterprise email environment. DOL will move email to the cloud, achieving one of the goals set forth by Federal OCIO 25 Point Plan. Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Service (MTIPS) and IPv6 projects provide an enterprise solution to federal mandates. DITIM is the vehicle to create enterprise solutions for federal mandates like these, reducing the effort across DOL and removing inconsistently implemented solutions.Enterprise Mobile Computing and Online Collaboration projects address the need to provide consistent and reliable services to the DOL end user community.","In FY11, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) began planning efforts that will result in making the DOL IT infrastructure more robust so that DOL's agencies can leverage technology as a means to achieving their missions. As part of that planning effort, the DITIM program was initiated. An enterprise architecture roadmap and plan for DOL to improve IT services was created.The DITIM Listening Tour was conducted in early FY11 to meet and interview DOL agency personnel throughout the United States. This resulted in gathering the field's perspective on the IT issues they faced each day as they tried to perform their work tasks. DITIM is focused on the DME efforts of several projects. In FY11, DITIM continued the planning efforts for DOL's DCCI, EaaS, and enterprise web conferencing solution projects. All these projects are on schedule to begin implementation in FY12. One DITIM project, MTIPS, moved from the planning to acquisition phase after contract award.","In FY12 and FY13 the DITIM program will spearhead additional project planning efforts, as well as begin to acquire enterprise infrastructure services. The DITIM program will continue to be responsible for the existing enterprise LAN/WAN services provided by the DOLNet project. The following highlights the major planning and acquisition accomplishments under the DITIM program for FY12 and FY13.The DITIM program will facilitate the migration of DOL's current silo email architecture to the cloud in FY12.

012-000003470,12,Department of Labor,22,Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,"The purpose of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is to enforce, for the benefit of job seekers and wage earners, the contractual promise of affirmative action and equal employment opportunity required of those who do business with the Federal government.  OFCCP achieves these goals by performing annual Compliance Evaluations of Federal Contractors and handling any Complaints filed by the American Public.  Critical to this effort is the Agency's ability to track and manage all Compliance Evaluation and Complaint cases efficiently and effectively to ensure the highest quality work is being done on behalf of the Federal Contractor community and its workers.  The Federal Contract Compliance System (FCCS) investment will enable the Agency to satisfy these requirements and achieve it's various operating goals to serve the workers of America.  FCCS is an Enterprise Case &amp; Content Management system to enable OFCCP to efficiently manage, track and report on casework. This FCCS system will include Case Management, Workflow/Business Process Management, Document Management, Records Management and Business Intelligence/Reporting component services.  The primary beneficiaries of this instance are the workers of America, federal employees of OFCCP, DOL executive management, and Federal Contractors.  This system will improve Agency efficiencies in managing case work and significantly enhance the tracking and reporting of the Agency both within the department and to the public.  This investment is a stand-alone investment and therefore not dependent on any other initiatives.","This system will enable the OFCCP Agency to improve both the quality and timeliness to manage case work and reduce the average duration of cases.  The system will enable the Agency to electronically track documentation and records associated with cases and eliminate some of the expenditures required with the mailing of case files or faxing of documentation.  This system will address existing performance gaps in allowing the agency to report more quickly on activities and capture all case documents electronically.This effort is divided into three modules that require funding from PY11 through BY13 for development.  The first module provides the major functional service components to the agency and the second and third deployments allow for the automated integration with other Private and Federal systems to gather case data more efficiently.  The third module will build the Compensation Data Tool to allow the Agency and Federal Contractors to more proactively capture necessary regulatory data through direct electronic upload in lieu of bulk mailings that incur budget costs for both the Agency and Federal Contracting firms.  A failure to fund the CY12 request will cause significant delays in the release of base functionality and will cost the Agency and DOL up to $1.5 million dollars to extend the life of the existing OFIS system into FY13.  A failure to fund the BY13 request will eliminate the ability to share data dynamically with other partnering agencies and the American Public.  Further, this failure to fund BY13 will eliminate the ability for Federal Contractors to upload their compliance data, resulting in a need to possibly increase the number of OFCCP Federal Employees or cause continued delays in the ability to close cases in a timely fashion.",PY11 saw the following accomplishments:1.

The Electronic Labor Organization Reporting System (e.LORS) is the major OLMS information technology system. It comprises various applications that support administration of the LMRDA program, including applications essential to processing reports to facilitate reporting and public disclosure. e.LORS systems have greatly contributed to the effectiveness of the LMRDA and OLMS achieving its goal of ensuring worker voice in the workplace.  Planned system improvements to OLMS IT systems would have a direct impact on OLMS performance measures.  OLMS plans to make needed improvements to the Online Public Disclosure Room (OPDR) by improving search capabilities, and increasing ease of navigation.  OLMS has established a goal to increase the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) score from the FY 2010 baseline of 58 to 64, which will demonstrate an increase in customer satisfaction.  Modernization will benefit both OLMS and its external stakeholders. Beginning in 2012, OLMS established improvements in the percentage of electronically filed reports as a priority goal with a goal of having over half of all reports filed electronically in FY 2016.   By promoting greater levels of electronic filing, OLMS benefits through reduced reliance on scanning and uploading, which incurs costs and the possibilities of error.  e.LORS primary stakeholders: unions, union members, researchers, and others, benefit with access to data and greater transparency of the information submitted.  Overall, a modernization could contribute to increased transparency, better secure the assets of union members and increase customer satisfaction levels.","An e.LORS Modernization would close the performance gaps identified by the Operational Analysis.  In summary, OLMS has a total of 12 public use forms, however only three are available for electronic submission, and only seven are currently available on the OLMS website for online public disclosure. Outmoded technology makes maintaining and tracking LMRDA and case data cumbersome and time consuming. As the Operational Analysis has concluded, these and other gaps negatively affect the agency's ability to efficiently and effectively meet its core mission of full public disclosure and data transparency.  The goals of a development and modernization effort would address these gaps and optimize all OLMS IT systems to operate more efficiently and effectively. Should this initiative not be funded, OLMS will not be able to increase the number of reports filed electronically, resulting in continued inefficiency of manual paper form filing and lack of transparency for both OLMS and filers. The existing application is degrading and will continue to degrade.  As a direct result, maintenance costs will increase. Additionally, OLMS will be unable to make essential improvements to the Public Disclosure Website and customer satisfaction levels will decrease.","-Upgraded the electronic forms for the LM-2, LM-3 and LM-4 so that electronic fling requires a dual authentication PIN and password, and eliminated the need for union officers to purchase a third party digital signature.-Provided day to day operations for OLMS staff including case management, processing of both paper and electronic reports required under the LMRDA, delinquency tracking, audit capabilities and compliance assistance tracking. -Provided public disclosure for union members and other interested parties. -Processed over 24K reports.","For the current year, OLMS will be continuing regular operations and maintenance activities including:-Provide day to day operations for OLMS staff including case management, processing of both paper and electronic reports required under the LMRDA, delinquency tracking, audit capabilities and compliance assistance tracking. -Provide public disclosure for Union Members and other interested parties by maintaining the OLMS Online Public Disclosure Room. -Complete a cost benefit analysis on the e.LORS system.

Benefits.gov provides users with a free, easy, and confidential online questionnaire to determine the specific benefit programs that they are likely eligible to receive. In December 2008, Benefits.gov partnered with the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency to successfully launch the DisasterAssistance.gov site.  DisasterAssitance.gov was a result of a President s Executive Order through operations of the Disaster Assistance Improvement Plan (DAIP) that eliminated the costs associated with maintaining redundant systems. More than 31 million US citizens have obtained information through the Disasterassistance.gov (DAIP) investment. Citizens solely depend on Benefits.gov to provide disaster assistance information from their 17 federal agency partnerships, in an effort to reduce the number of forms filed and shorten application times.","The Benefits.gov Program is one of the original E-Gov initiatives founded in 2002, with the objective of leveraging technology to increase the efficiency and ease with which citizens interact with the government. Benefits.gov provides users with a free, easy, and confidential online questionnaire to determine the specific benefit programs that they are likely eligible to receive and application information for each identified program. Citizens obtain value by more quickly identifying benefit programs for which they may be eligible, while frequently learning about benefits that they are eligible for that they would have never known about otherwise. The 17 Federal partner agencies obtain value by having citizen benefit inquiries come through the lower cost Internet channel, as opposed to through a call center or in-office visit. Additionally, since citizens are often able to ascertain their eligibility for specific programs using Benefits.gov, agencies save additional money by not needing to review applications from citizens who are ultimately deemed ineligible. Benefits.gov identifies and fulfills performance gaps in regards to a reduced response time and access to information. Prior to Benefits.gov, citizens were required to visit multiple websites in order to determine eligibility requirements. Benefits.gov provides a central hub for benefits information, where citizens can easily access all available eligibility and prescreening services for more than 1,000 Federal and State benefit and assistance programs.","Inform Citizens   Enhanced citizen awareness of available government benefit programs by applying increasingly economic outreach solutions to include expanded use of Twitter and the launch of a Benefits.gov Facebook page.Improve User Experience   Improved benefit eligibility prescreening questionnaire, migrated DisasterAssistance.gov into a cloud-hosted environment, and upgraded the Content Management System to enable more frequent updates and operation in the cloud.","The following accomplishments are planned using $450K of FY11 carry-over funds plus $3.2M of FY12 funds:CY 2012Inform Citizens   Expand use of Facebook and Twitter to increase program outreach potential to citizens nationwide at the least possible cost.

012-000002085,12,Department of Labor,19,Mine Safety and Health Administration,"MSHA Standardized Information System (MSIS) is a web-based application, the critical core information management system enabling MSHA to accomplish its mission of  protecting the health and safety of the nation's miners. MSIS supports a variety of critical functions that enforce the Mine Act (1977), the MINER Act (2006) and title 30 CFR.  These encompass the enforcment of safety and health standards; supporting miner and instructor certifications; assessing violation penalties; managing mine information; and managing contested violations.   These functions provide an effective means of reducing the frequency and severity of accidents; minimizing health hazards and promoting improved safety and health conditions at the nation's 14,000 mines.MSIS serves the business needs of six agency program areas -- Office of Assessments; Education, Policy &amp; Development; Coal Enforcement, Metal/Non-Metal Enforcement, Technical Support, and Office of Injury &amp; Employment Information.  It is the primary enterprise application framework and data repository for MSHA.MSIS provides integrated data processing for MSHA and provides the most current industry-wide data available for the nation's mines.  This enables MSHA to closely track safety conditions, track compliance, and identify critical patterns of violations.   Being the definitive source of mine safety data, non-government entities like private industry, educational institutions, research organizations, in addition to other government agencies rely heavily on regular distribution of data and reports for their business operations.  MSIS is also used to ensure that mines are inspected on schedule.  MSIS has recently been expanded to support the certification of mining equipment for the mining industry.   MSIS is currently being expanded to support processing of samples taken from mines.","BY plans include:-Revise Assessments bill delivery using USPS: The system currently uses automated delivery via  FedEx but has no capability to auto-correct addresses. Undelivered mail which must be re-processed at added costs from FedEx plus charges for corrections. With USPS delivery services, MSHA will significantly lower costs since USPS auto-corrects addresses.   Without this change, the current costs will increase and addressing errors will not be corrected.  -Establish data sharing and mine operator contested case load management with the solicitor SOLAR system;  This will result in improvements to case tracking, reducing the case backlog and more equal distribution of case load between solicitors and MSHA's Certified Legal Representatives.    A funding gap will perpetuate the backlog, perpetuate inconsistencies in data between the two systems and continue inefficient management of case load.-Implement enhancement and changes identified in the Upper Big Branch (UBB) mine's disaster investigation report:   When the final report is published in December 2011, there will be critical changes to MSIS that should include tightened requirements for monitoring flagrant violations and improved management and processing of mine samples.   These changes will be critical to ensure that the mistakes of the UBB disaster are not repeated.  Without funding, the existing deficiencies will continue and would inhibit MSHA from detecting future mine hazards.   -Modernize the Mine Plan and Approval function:  MSHA is required to manage a wide range of mine plans and associated review processes.  By reengineering this function, the application can be made to enforce a consistent method of managing and approving mine plans.  It also affords a means to extend the capability to manage additional types of mine plans.  A deficiency in funding will continue the inefficient process and lead to inaccurate mine plan data.-Reengineer the COBOL samples system:   The effort modernizes and migrates an obsolete legacy coal dust processing system and extends it to enable support for future tightened dust standards.   This effort plays a key role in the agency's goal of eliminating Black Lung.  This will enable MSHA to more accurately process dust samples and integrate data with MSIS, reducing errors and operating costs.  A funding gap will result in continued reliance on the unstable legacy system, inhibiting monitoring of the factors contributing to Black Lung.","There were 3 maintenance/enhancement releases:-improved Hazardous Conditions Complaints; E-gov access; Qualifications and Certifications (Q&amp;C) access; Penalty Assessments (PA) bill/status marking-updated Part 50 architecture/forms-completed interface edits to Health Samples legacy system-enhanced menus across MSIS-improved searching for Conferences and Contests records-added single signon capability across application-implemented Special Assessment candidate rules for PA-improved reporting -- reports for Potential Pattern of Violations and flagrant violations; incorporated flagrant indicator-initiated migration to USPS for delivery of billsTechnical Support application was added to MSIS and was the major release for the year.

012-000001010,12,Department of Labor,5,Employment and Training Administration,"The Job Corps Student Pay Allotment Management Information System (SPAMIS) funds for the Job Corps program a custom computer application, including the secure IT facility and overhead to support it, that provides a data management system used by approximately 20,000 Job Corps staff members to recruit and enroll students (citizens), process student payroll, track academic and vocational training status for approximately 103,000 Job Corps students (citizens) who participate in the program on an annual basis, as well as generate and distribute a suite of performance reports used by Job Corps federal staff to manage the program.   Job Corps is primarily a residential program that helps young, disadvantaged citizens, aged 16 to 24, obtain an academic education and gain vocational job skills, and ultimately be placed in a job or advanced education.SPAMIS supports all aspects of the Job Corps program through modules that facilitate, through data management and reporting, the following Job Corps functions: outreach and admissions (recruiting), academic and vocational training on center, testing on center, student payroll, student surveys, job placement, and management performance reports.","The Job Corps SPAMIS investment closed the performance gap that Job Corps had for a standardized, centralized custom computer application to process and distribute Job Corps student payroll, support the tracking and processing of Job Corps student information, and the generation and distribution of management performance reports.In support of Job Corps' mission, SPAMIS consistently delivers the following performance objectives: accurate and timely student payments, accurate and timely performance reporting, a high customer satisfaction rating, and Workforce Investment Act (WIA) compliance.Without SPAMIS, Job Corps staff would be unable to admit students, track center activity, administer testing, pay students, or place graduates in a career program. The approximately 103,000 students who participate in the Job Corps program annually would be negatively impacted, losing the assistance to obtain an academic education, to gain vocational job skills, and to obtain a job or advanced education. Ultimately, this could result in thousands of disadvantaged citizens struggling to enter the workforce without assistance. If the investment is not fully funded (e.g., if funding does not account for inflationary adjustments), then this would impact Job Corps' ability to properly maintain the data center facility that houses the SPAMIS investment. The inability to make necessary repairs and replacements at the data center facility would present a risk to the safety and security of the SPAMIS equipment, and would negatively impact the availability of SPAMIS to the Job Corps students and staff who depend on it daily.","Key accomplishments for SPAMIS during the prior year (FY 2011) included: (1) Maintaining the SPAMIS modules to ensure compliance with federal and Job Corps programmatic directives;(2) Maintaining the SPAMIS Technical Assistance Center to respond to approximately 141,400 help desk inquiries; (3) Maintaining the telecommunications infrastructure to facilitate data communications for 20,000 staff and 45,000 active students; (4) Managing the daily operations of the SPAMIS computing infrastructure including backup/recovery and system jobs to produce 3,197 monthly reports and process payroll for 103,000 students (annually) and 20,000 surveyed former students; (5) Maintaining the data center facility where the SPAMIS information technology infrastructure is housed; (6) Maintaining the Enterprise Architecture to ensure that security guidelines are in place; and (7) Providing project management functions to ensure compliance with federal and Job Corps directives.","The primary accomplishments planned for SPAMIS during the current year (FY 2012) and the budget year (FY 2013) include: (1) Testing the Electronic Training Achievement Record (E-TAR) SPAMIS software upgrade, which would replace the current paper-based training achievement recordkeeping, resulting in a paperwork reduction of over 7.75 million sheets a year, and allowing instructors to increase the time spent with Job Corps students by as much as 25%; and (2) Testing the Student Portal SPAMIS upgrade, a web-based portal and cloud computing solution for e-mail, file storage, and office applications, which will incorporate the student portion of E-TAR, and will give Job Corps students and graduates a standardized Job Corps e-mail account (including a calendar function) to improve their ability to communicate with Job Corps staff and potential employers, 25 gigabytes of secure online storage (for convenient access to resumes or other important business-related materials), and access to critical office applications (including Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote) which will greatly improve Job Corps students' and graduates' ability to compete in today's job market.Other key accomplishments planned for SPAMIS during the current year and the budget year include: (1) Consolidation, virtualization and upgrade of the SPAMIS server farm (increasing performance and energy efficiency), (2) Upgrade to current application software versions and associated code to keep system current, (3) Evaluation of Cloud Computing offerings that may further reduce costs, while providing the required security for the Job Corps student data which is entrusted to the Job Corps program, and (4) Deployment of replacements for equipment that has reached end-of-life.Additional accomplishments planned for SPAMIS during the current year and the budget year include: (1) Upgrades to the SPAMIS application modules, (2) Deployment of upgraded equipment and improved functionality for the user network of 20,000 staff and 45,000 active students, (3) Repairs and replacements to the Data Center Facility where SPAMIS is housed, and (4) Continued compliance with all new and existing federal regulatory requirements.",89.821,11.944,12.205,12.472,1991.0,2022.0,Not applicable.,"The System is in a steady state and the inherent level-of-effort services, hardware and software licenses/maintenance for Job Corps SPAMIS are acquired through Firm Fixed Price contracts.

012-000001025,12,Department of Labor,11,Employee Benefits Security Administration,"EFAST2 is a web-based system supporting mandated electronic filing of Form 5500 series returns/reports. EFAST2 was implemented on 12/30/2009 replacing the legacy, paper-based EFAST production system.EFAST2 supports the Secretary of Labor's &quot;DOL Strategic Goal 4:  &quot;Secure health benefits and, for those not working, provide income security,&quot; and EBSA's Outcome Goal to:  &quot;Improve health benefits and retirement security for all workers.&quot;The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and provisions of the Internal Revenue Code require certain employee benefit plans (e.g., pension plans, health plans) to submit information on their size, funding, operations, and other characteristics annually to the Federal government on Form 5500 Series annual returns / reports.The ERISA Filing Acceptance System 2 (EFAST2) is a &quot;collaborative initiative&quot; among three agencies (The Department of Labor (DOL) Employee Benefit Security Administration (EBSA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)) designed to collect, process and disclose data and images from over one million Form 5500 series filings submitted each year to Government.  The information collected on the Form 5500 allows EBSA to administer Titles I &amp; III of ERISA, allows IRS to administer Titles II &amp; III of ERISA and allows PBGC to administer Title IV of ERISA. EFAST2 also allows these agencies to administer the Pension Protection Act, which includes provisions for the collection and distribution of Form 5500 data to the Government.  The EFAST2 system is the primary source of Form 5500 information used by Government regulators in enforcing ERISA, PPA and related regulations, and is therefore critical in protecting health and retirement benefits of American workers.   Note: Annual EFAST2 system Operations and Maintenance services are acquired from a third-party vendor through a fixed-price contract. The FY13 Operations and Maintenance contract is an $8M fixed-price contract representing a major portion of the total EFAST2 investment funding.  System roll-over activities to prepare EFAST2 to process subsequent Form 5500 form years are part of the fixed-price contact.  EFAST2 system performance metrics are reviewed on a monthly and quarterly basis to ensure performance and cost compliance.","EFAST2 replaced the paper-based EFAST system.  EFAST2 addresses the following performance gaps: 1) Reduce the total Form 5500 processing-cycle turnaround time from over 90 days (under legacy EFAST) to 1 day; 2) Accuracy improved to 100% through electronic filing and automated edit checking performed during the filing process, and; 3) Provide real-time access to filing status and public access to submitted filings within one day of their receipt. EFAST2 closes these gaps primarily through mandated electronic filing.  Paper-processing was subject to mail correspondence delays, data-capture error, human error, and correspondingly slow processing throughput. EFAST2 improves data quality by electronically prompting filers to correct errors prior to submission.  EFAST2 is less costly, more accurate and faster than its predecessor. EFAST2 also allows public and authorized Government users to review portions of filings within 1 day of processing on the internet.Partial funding would threaten the quality, security and availability of the EFAST2 system and its data; and may force the cessation of EFAST2 operations, which would jeopardize enforcement of ERISA and PPA, and disrupt public filing.   The EFAST2 processing contract is divided into fixed-price, one-year contract option periods to support the annual release of the Form 5500 Plan Year template. The required work cannot be pared down nor costs reduced in response to a shortfall in funding.  The contract requirements are not separately priced and would be difficult to eliminate in pieces.   A reduction in funding, then, would affect the EFAST2 program oversight support contractor budgets. These contractors are responsible for providing technical, security, performance analysis, capital planning, and acquisition support to the EFAST2 investment. Funding reductions would negatively impact system security review frequency/quality; diminish quality control analysis of the EFAST2 processing performance; and risk poor quality Form 5500 data, and (ultimately) the Government's enforcement of ERISA and PPA. Note: The EFAST2 E300 yearly funding estimates include funding for contractor activities that span more than one fiscal year.  EFAST2 contracts are based on statutorily-mandated Form 5500 series submission dates, and on competitively-priced contract periods.

012-000003645,12,Department of Labor,25,Departmental Management,"The DOL Human Resources Line of Business (HRLOB) Shared Service Center (SSC) funds an investment to migrate DOL's human resources (HR) information systems to a Federal SSC. The SSC will replace DOL's internal systems for personnel action processing, time and attendance, and HR reporting. Migrating to an SSC will enable DOL to focus on managing its HR processes rather than its HR systems. Today, DOL bears all the costs associated with maintaining its internal HR systems. Yet these internal systems simply replicate functionality provided by the SSC. By moving to the shared hardware, software, development, and support infrastructure of an SSC, DOL will reduce its costs and be able to make better use of information technology staff resources.DOL will benefit by replacing antiquated technology with a SSC's modern architecture. The end result will be a system that is more reliable, more secure, and easier to integrate with other technology initiatives.The SSC will provide new and improved functionality that will significantly reduce HR staff workload. For example, up-front transaction validation will reduce both the number of errors that occur and the amount of time spent reconciling between different systems. Employee self-service will allow a number of transactions to be entered in the front office, avoiding time-consuming routing and data entry on the back-end.   As the project design phase has not yet begun, dependencies on other investments are not yet certain.  There have been significant changes to the schedule and the estimated cost since the FY12 submission. The project schedule slipped by 12 months due to a delay in FY11 funding that delayed the execution of an interagency agreement with the SSC. The funding estimates have also been revised to more accurately reflect the scope of the project. The revised estimate is based on the responses to the RFP and the need for the SSC to build custom functionality.DOL is funding the migration efforts in advance by transferring project funding to the SSC in FY11. This will support the SSC work to be accomplished in FY12 and a portion of FY13. The delay in receiving FY11 funds has coincidentally mitigated the impact of work delays due to a likely FY12 Continuing Resolution. Once funding is approved for FY12, it will be used to complete the migration efforts in FY13, and will reduce the funds needed for FY13.  An updated cost benefit reflects that this is still a sound investment.","DOL's HR systems are no longer supported by the software vendor. Lacking vendor support, the patchwork of maintenance and upgrades are increasingly difficult, costly, and time consuming. If a failure occurred in these fragile systems, issue investigation and resolution could be significantly hampered and delayed by the lack of vendor support. This is an unacceptable risk for a system that has been designated Critical to the continuation of DOL Mission Essential Functions in the event of an emergency. In addition, the system is at greater risk from unpatched security vulnerabilities, which, if exploited, could expose personally identifiable information, financial data, and payroll data. By comparison, the SSC uses current versions of industry-standard software, and has active support agreements with the vendors. DOL does not have an active disaster recovery environment for its HR systems. As described above, this puts DOL Mission Essential Functions at risk in the event of a system failure or disaster. The SSC maintains full disaster recovery environments for all of its system components, including data replication to avoid data loss and rapid system restoration after the disaster.The current, in-house systems also cannot support new government regulations, policies, and initiatives. On a functional level, it is increasingly difficult to modify the system to keep up with significant HR changes, such as the new Pathways Program. Technologically, the systems cannot support initiatives such as the cloud computing directives in the Federal CIO's 25 Point Implementation Plan and the PIV-card authentication mandated in OMB M-11-11. Finally, if the investment is not funded, DOL cannot bring itself into compliance with the OMB mandate to migrate to an SSC. OMB has determined that these migrations are beneficial to taxpayers, by reducing expenditures on duplicative systems.

The revised estimate is based on the responses to the RFP and the need for the SSC to build/customize new functionality to meet DOL's business mission needs. A delay in budget authority also impacted SSC ability to complete critical tasks. The increased funding will allow the SSC to execute multiple activities and complete some of the critical tasks simultaneously.,All of the HRLOB SSC contractual agreements are interagency agreements with other federal agencies.

012-000001055,12,Department of Labor,20,Bureau of Labor Statistics,"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) System directly supports the Secretary of Labor's Vision of Good Jobs for Everyone.  In particular, it supports Department of Labor (DOL) Strategic Goal 5, to produce timely and accurate data on the economic conditions of workers and their families, and DOL Outcome Goal 5.1, to provide sound and impartial information on labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy for decision making, including support for the formulation of economic and social policy affecting virtually all Americans.The CPI, which is produced by this IT investment, is the Nation's principal source of information concerning trends in consumer prices and inflation and provides a set of measures to help determine the overall state of the U.S. economy.  The CPI program's main beneficiaries are the U.S. public, government entities, and private industries.The CPI, which is designated as a Principal Federal Economic Indicator (PFEI), is used for economic analysis, policy formulation, and to escalate contract costs among individuals and organizations.  The index also has a major impact on the Federal Government's finances because it is used to adjust payments to Social Security recipients, Federal and military retirees, and for other entitlement programs, such as supplemental nutrition assistance programs (food stamps) and school lunches.  It is used to adjust individual income tax brackets and personal exemptions for changes due to inflation.This investment utilizes the &quot;BLS - LABSTAT Maintenance&quot; (UII 012-000003055) investment for data dissemination via the Internet and the reported expenditures from the &quot;BLS - Consumer Expenditure and Information Systems&quot; (UII 012-000003015) as a basis for CPI weights.  The CPI also relies on the bureau-wide BLS LAN/WAN infrastructure that is part of the &quot;DOL - Agencies' General Support Systems&quot; (UII 012-000003605) investment.","In the past, the BLS processed CPI data using labor-intensive and time-consuming processes.  The CPI System closes this performance gap by providing a modern computing environment.  This investment continually updates and improves the CPI System to ensure that the BLS is able to produce CPI data, which is the primary measure of consumer inflation in the United States.In the event of a significant funding shortfall, the BLS may be required to delay or defer planned maintenance tasks and deliverables.  This may have a detrimental impact on the collection, production, and timely release of the CPI.The continued operation and maintenance of the CPI System is necessary to efficiently and effectively support the collection, production, and timely release of the CPI.  Without proper maintenance, the CPI would be unable to keep its data current and would not be able to properly measure changing consumer price trends.  Without ongoing operation and support, the CPI System would run on unsupported software and be at risk of not being able to produce the PFEI on time.  Without a properly secure environment, confidential data could be at risk of unauthorized release.",Investment accomplishments in FY 2011 include:- Completed all monthly CPI releases as scheduled.- Completed testing and transition for upgrades to COTS products.- Completed construction phase for migrating the Commodities &amp; Services (C&amp;S) system component on the Sybase database platform to the Oracle database platform.

012-000002005,12,Department of Labor,25,Departmental Management,"The purpose of the Enterprise Communications Initiative (ECI) is centralized management of DOL Web services, e-correspondence, language translation and contact centers. This investment benefits the public by increasing the transparency and consistency of DOL information, while decreasing associated costs. A significant amount of important DOL information is communicated to the public and to Department employees through agency-level communication channels that are separately funded and managed by the agencies. This dispersed system of agency-level information presents significant challenges to the public in finding answers that span several different agencies or organizations.  In order to find the information needed- the public has to know which agency (or agencies) has the information, must seek out the information in multiple locations, and finally must merge the different components of the response into a single coherent answer.  In order to better manage all its public-facing Web sites, intranets, e-correspondence, and foreign language translation services, the Department of Labor established the Enterprise Communications Initiative (ECI).  The purpose of ECI is to make more effective use of DOL assets, eliminate wasteful duplication, reduce cost and reconcile inconsistencies across the Department s Enterprise Communication (EC) channels. Since the start of this initiative in 2005, ECI has made steady and significant progress on implementing and centralizing Department-wide EC services.  ECI is a service investment targeted at providing EC services to agencies and the public. ECI hosts all but six of DOL agencies Web sites on dol.gov and ECI has implemented and operates a comprehensive library of EC services and tools that are available to all DOL agencies and offices.  These EC services and tools include, but are not limited to: the Web search engine, Web performance metrics tools, Distributed hosting and caching services, Content management, Common Development Environment, the e-Mail Subscription Service, and social media support. In addition, ECI also provides application development services to DOL agencies through its Project Services operation. ECI is directly aligned with the DOL mission and supports all of its performance and outcome goals by ensuring timely and accurate DOL information to the public.","Under ECI, all information dissemination services will be centralized into a single, multi-layered, citizen-centered communication strategy. ECI strongly aligns with the IT systems by mission support area by supporting the DOL agencies in providing timely and accurate mission services. ECI provides key services that enable DOL agencies to communicate with the public and ensures website availability for continuity of operations. These services include the worldwide distributed hosting solution that guarantees 100% availability of DOL.gov and allows for external live webcasting; the web metrics solution that allows agencies to measure website usage; web application development; the e-mail subscription service made available to all agencies; web chat services in support of all agencies; ensuring compliance with and issuing guidance for security requirements, laws, regulations, and OMB guidance; and maintaining DOL s social media presence.Freezing at the FY 2012 President's Request level will have the following impacts on DOL customers and internal stakeholders:a. Eliminate Distributed Hosting Solution (Akamai): Akamai decreases bandwidth demands on the DOL-hosted servers, enables streaming live video and protects against malicious attacks. It also allows the website to be accessed by the public should the DOL s network go down. Eliminating Akamai would eliminate all of the above services currently provided to the public. b. Eliminate Web Metrics Reporting: All DOL agencies depend on the Akamai Web metrics solution to determine websites  usage. Eliminating this cloud service will eliminate the agencies  ability to measure current Web service levels, and understand the requirements of the public. This will have a direct impact on their Web operations and their alignment with OMB objectives for using cloud services. c. Eliminate E-mail Subscription Service: Thousands of DOL visitors make use of the Email subscription service to keep themselves informed in regards to policy and guidance changes. Eliminating this service would impact 100,000 subscribers to the Secretary's weekly DOL Newsletter.","- Enabled the use of DOL Events Calendar on multiple platforms including mobile devices, web and other.- Allowed the general public to view all DOL grant data in an easy format as part of the Open Government Initiative- Enabled users to provide feedback on DOL.Gov or LaborNet content.       - Provided mobile access to economic indicators and statistics - Provided a ready-to-use interface for an authorized user to create/edit/remove customized search Interfaces.- Automated the process for tracking media inquiries.- Allowed the nation's workforce to easily enter their hours worked into their personal phone from DOL.- Automated the management and publishing of agency content to LaborNet.- Completed policy and guidance on Domain names and Mobile application development.","ECI plans to maintain its current operational activities for CY and BY.

012-000000001,12,Department of Labor,25,Departmental Management,"Disability.gov is a collection of digital communication and information dissemination channels focused around a web portal hub that provides an interactive, community-driven information network of disability-related resources.  The types of resources available include critical and timely information concerning programs, services, laws and benefits to Americans with disabilities, their families, Veterans, educators, employers and many others.  Disability.gov connects people to thousands of resources on employment, housing, transportation, income support, health care, technology, and other programs for persons with disabilities from Federal, state and local government agencies, educational institutions and non-profit organizations.Everyday, Disability.gov fulfills its mission to link persons with disabilities and other interested individuals with comprehensive information so that they can effectively navigate their worlds, and ultimately, more effectively participate in their communities and the workforce. For many first time visitors, it is critical that they find the information they need quickly and easily while simultaneously making them aware of ancillary resources they might find beneficial.  The site is continuously reviewed by subject matter experts to ensure that all resources are of high quality and applicable to the user's needs while remaining easy to use.Customer satisfaction is monitored using several methods to ensure user's needs are being met and give them a voice in how the site improves. Utilizing advances in digital service delivery, social networking, cloud technologies, and targeted application of subject matter expertise, Disability.gov maximizes the impact of funds used to disseminate information to citizens across the 22 participating Federal partners and other content contributors making it a very cost-effective service that benefits citizens in need.","Prior to Disability.gov, myriad government sites with duplicative information existed; however, there was no single site through which individuals could efficiently and effectively access disability-related resources and find the information they needed.  To date, ODEP has partnered with 22 Federal agencies, State and local governments, and others in order to provide a one-stop source of information making it possible for citizens to obtain information about the services they require in a streamlined way.In order to reach as many citizens as possible and disseminate timely and crucial information concerning disability-related resources, government programs, and opportunities to help themselves, the program initially selected a web portal to provide a one-stop resource for important and often times crucial information reviewed and organized by subject matter experts from across the disability community.  The program continuously reviews new technologies and methods for maximizing and expanding outreach to citizens while maintaining cost-conscious project management practices.  This has allowed the program to increase the number of citizens reached while avoiding millions of dollars in expenditures required by alternative information distribution methods.  At the same time, citizens are not required to search through hundreds of web sites to find the information they need.  It is all conveniently available through not only the web site, but also a variety of other communication channels.  As one of the first programs within DOL to adopt social media technologies, we were able to leverage their outreach and service expansion capabilities to enhance the channels of communication to our stakeholders and drive our continued growth and impact.  While our visitor numbers continue to increase, our unit costs per visit continue to decrease and we are able to provide additional methods for citizens to interact with their government and receive the services they need.If the funding necessary to maintain the system's operational level and quality of the resources is not provided, then system performance will degrade, new resources will not be accessible, and the quality of those remaining resources will decrease with the passage of time. In addition, the ability of citizens to interact successfully with their government will be curtailed.","In FY2011, the program accomplished the following:1) Collaborated with White House's Office of Public Engagement to expand citizen participation and dialogue.2) Implemented new search engine to improve returned search results .3) Began improved indexing and tagging of resources in order to support enhance search functionality.4) Began cloud migration to Infrastructure-as-a-Service in order to provide increased bandwidth on demand and decrease costs to host special events.5) Established new acquisition vehicles to better support migration to cloud-type services.6) Successfully closed outstanding findings from previous year s FISMA audit.","In 2012, the program expects to:1) Expand partnership collaboration to improve awareness &amp; participation, ensure quality resources, and lower costs; expand collaboration with citizens by gathering feedback, enhancing participation, and providing customer service.2) Maintain Disability.gov including security testing, reporting &amp; updates, so that disability-related information, programs, and other resources are available to the widest audience when needed.3) Finalize migration from current dedicated infrastructure platform to a cloud infrastructure hosting services platform.In 2013, the program plans to:1) Continue to expand partnership collaboration to improve awareness &amp; participation, ensure quality resources, and lower costs; expand collaboration with citizens by gathering feedback, enhancing participation, and providing customer service.2) Continue to maintain Disability.gov including security testing, reporting &amp; updates, so that disability-related information, programs, and other resources are available to the widest audience when needed.3) Develop an automated mechanism to compile and categorize state and local information in order to cost-effectively fill gaps in resource collection and better serve citizens at their point-of-need.",14.7672,2.04216,1.846,1.84739,2003.0,2021.0,"OMB and Senior Departmental Managers asked the IPMT to develop an alternative business model incorporating a Fee-for-Service system replicating other existing eGov initiatives.

In a Fixed-Price environment, the cost/price risk of cost overruns is entirely on the contractor, so the risk does not warrant the cost of requiring the contractor to report on EVMS.

More specifically, this investment involves migrating from the GELCO-based Travel Management System to CW Government Travel's e2 Solutions (the e-Travel offering selected by the Department) and operating the legacy travel management system until the transition to e2 Solutions is complete.  In addition to the government-wide share-in cost savings and other gains noted in GSA's business case, this investment will yield two major operational improvements: - The productivity gains/reduced transaction fees derived from using an Online Booking Tool. This, coupled with lower travel agent fees, will likely lead to improved morale and projected airline booking fee savings of approximately $900K per year.  - Worldwide paperless processing including automated electronic routing and approvals, which should yield better controls/accountability and an expected financial benefit of almost $750K per year. This investment is dependent on the following Department of State major investments:* JFMS -- the financial systems operated and maintained under this investment generate travel reimbursements* GFACS -- which provides automated feeds of personnel data to ensure that travel is authorized for only active employees as well as provide e2 Solutions with the correct bank routing information for reimbursements* IT Infrastructure which provides the communications backbone needed to access this cloud-based solution from inside the Department's firewall.","The Department's vision for empowering diplomacy and development with information and tools available anytime, anywhere&quot; cannot be achieved without a world-class travel support system, especially for international travel.  This investment addresses this performance gap through the world-wide deployment of an end-to-end, cloud-based computing solution.  This web-based system promotes more efficient operations through the use of employee self-service capabilities such as  online booking, electronic routing capabilities to streamline the approval process, and automated interfaces with the Department's financial systems to ensure more accurate and timely employee reimbursements (of out-of-pocket travel expenses) .  Importantly, these activities can be performed securely at post, at home, or on the road (using any computer connected to the internet).  The impact of a significant funding cut is largely dependent on the outcome of GSA's ETS2 acquisition activity.  Should CW Government Travel continue to offer services to government agencies under ETS2, the lack of full funding would not impact the investment as it would be unnecessary to execute the contingency activities associated with migrating to a new provider.  However, if migrating to a new e-Travel services provider becomes necessary under ETS2, the effort would undoubtedly be delayed.  This could place the Department in an untenable position should CW Government Travel pull out of the business once its ETS1 contract ends.","Planned accomplishments for CY12 include:* Complete the phased, global deployment of e2 Solutions. * Migrate all bureaus and posts to a major new release of e2 Solutions (that has been designed to improve usability/efficiency).* Retire the legacy Travel Manager system. * Select an ETS2 services provider and develop a redeployment strategy (if necessary).","Planned accomplishments for BY13 include:* Modify and test interfaces to/from ETS1 to align with product improvements.* Design, develop, and test software enhancements to a to be determined ETS2 offering to support a redeployment under ETS2 (if necessary).* Begin a phased, worldwide redeployment of a to be determined ETS2 offering (if necessary).Planned accomplishments for BY14 include:* Modify and test interfaces to/from ETS1 to align with product improvements.* Continue the phased, worldwide redeployment of a to be determined ETS2 offering (if necessary).",19.454,5.641,7.971,8.128,2000.0,2015.0,"As a contingency, the costs of acquiring a new e-Travel services provider have been added.

This program operates & modernizes the Department's global network, and directly provides essential communication to 285 diplomatic posts around the world, including embassies, consulates, and multi-agency missions. It connects 240 additional sites, such as post annexes. This initiative supports the Department s Sustainability Plans, Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), and 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal IT. It provides the capability for Cloud Computing, Data Center Consolidation, and ClassNet Regionalization, and supports Cyber Security policy by ensuring the protection, reliability and resilience of the network infrastructure and its data. It benefits DoS customers by providing an IT network infrastructure that s available anytime /anywhere, with secure access to DoS IT resources so they can perform services required to meet mission goals and objectives.This investment looks for methods to decrease the cost of IT Services by analyzing network capacity requirements, coordinating requirements with posts worldwide, and procuring bandwidth capacity at a reduced cost. While bandwidth requirements continue to increase as well as the need for modernization, competitive sourcing and emerging technologies allow us to achieve these goals. The service offerings provided through this investment are largely operational in nature but are required by users and customers accessing Department resources.  Administering services at an enterprise level, allows us to minimize duplicative initiatives, leverage economies of scale, and further reduce costs to the Department through the use of innovative technologies.The primary beneficiaries of this investment are all Department of State (DoS) network users and it s customers that access IT resources on the Department s network infrastructure.  This investment is dependent upon ENM, . Bandwidth Mgmt, COMSEC, EKMS, & Intrusion Detection/Firewall investments.  All IT investments requiring OpenNet and/or ClassNet connectivity are dependent on this investment, such as FAN; Data Center Services & Hosting; GITM Refresh Services; Consular Systems Modernization; JFMS; IPMS; Messaging Services and Email; and Security/Cyber Security Services.","This investment addresses several gaps identified in support of the DoS mission, as outlined in the Department of State Agency Sustainability Plan (ASP), QDDR, and current DoS and USAID Joint Strategic Plan. Below are some of the initiatives in this investment that address gaps identified in these plans:Power Management   provides shutdown and wake-up services for all Department desktops, supporting ASP Goal 7: Electronic Stewardship and Data Centers and the Departments Green Initiative. It contributes to saving millions of dollars and cutting 21,000 tons of carbon emissions by cutting power waste by computers.

It also provides the Authentication/Authorization controls for enclaves deployed under NexGEN.iPost   consolidates and presents enterprise infrastructure data regarding Performance, Security, and Configuration.  This tool provides site risk scoring to identify security vulnerabilities in the network and provides administrators with a prioritized  get-well  roadmap for addressing security needs quickly and efficiently.  State Trusted Internet Connection (STIC) and Domestic ClassNet Port Security   both of these projects address cyber security and network vulnerabilities concerns addressed in the QDDR.Virtual Lab   this project provides a foundation for long term solutions to lab sprawl within the Department and supports Electronic Stewardship and Data Center goals.Centralized and Enterprise Patch Management addresses network security and vulnerability concerns by ensuring the Departments workstations and servers remain patched as new threats are identified.Any reduction from full funding would significantly hamper the goals and mission of the Department. It would directly suspend the implementation of tools required to monitor and secure the infrastructure during deployment of the NexGen infrastructure to USAID, and when cyber threats are emerging. Reductions in funding would restrain this investment from making necessary performance improvements required to support growing bandwidth needs of the Department. Our ability to maintain proper technological operations and stability of the network would be grossly limited, placing significant risks on performance and security of the network infrastructure, and possibly increase costs to the Department to respond to new threats that could have been avoided.","Accomplishments include the implementation of tool upgrades for efficiency and greater return on investment; power management tools that reduced costs and addressed environmental concerns; improved security through automation of software packages and centralized patch management; reduced cost per bit for bandwidth; and implemented automated password reset to save labor costs.  The Ring of Fire project provided an enhanced backhaul for campuses to ESOC East.  Increased Risk Scoring capabilities through iPost toolset. Completed successful planning and pilot of the NexGEN initiative. Through innovation, we will continue to build on our success to ensure the Departments IT infrastructure remains secure, reliable and resilient to accomplish its diplomatic mission.  The successes have attributed to cost savings, more efficient operations, better security of the infrastructure, and optimized performance for all DoS users domestic and globally.","In CY2012 and BY2013, this investment will focus on the following major tasks:(1)Deploy and integrate NeuralStar to enhance network performance monitoring and a complete topology of the enterprise, that will allow increased network monitoring and authenticating capabilities in support of NexGEN and FAN.(2)Implement Automated Password Reset (APR) to provide Active Directory (AD) self service management for domestic and overseas users.

014-000000048,14,Department of State,0,Department of State,"Cyber Security is a branch of technology known as information security as applied to computers and networks.  The objective of cyber security includes protection of information and property from theft, corruption, or natural disaster, while allowing the information and property to remain accessible and productive to its intended users.  Critical benefits resulting from the execution and utilization of cyber security technologies are reduced incidences of identity theft and PII compromise, reduced incidences of physical and infrastructure compromise, and protection against espionage or other malicious attacks.  Cyber security is achieved through:  1. assessing the vulnerability of a network and associated applications;  2. identifying areas of weakness; 3. implementing plans and applications to control weaknesses; 4. performing operational analyses and incident monitoring; 5. conducting physical security assessments at remote sites of the network; 6. clearly define and communicate roles, responsibilities, and requirements of the network managers and users; 7. establish a configuration management process; and 8. manage risk.  Activities performed and managed by the child initiatives support the Department of State s cyber security program. This major initiative encompasses the following initiatives:  AIS Security Infrastructure Support Program, Anti-Virus Program (AV), Communications Security Audit Program (COMSEC), Electronic Key Management System (EKMS), In-Line Network Encryption (INE), Information Assurance Program (IA), Mainframe System Security Program (MSP), Public Key Infrastructure and Biometrics Logical Access Development and Execution Program (PKI/BLADE), Red Switch, Role-Based Cyber Security Training, Secure Voice Program, and Technical Security and Safeguards (TSS).","The purpose of cyber security is to protect an organization's valuable resources, such as information, hardware, and software.  Through the selection and application of appropriate safeguards, cyber security helps the organization's mission by protecting its physical and financial resources, reputation, legal position, employees, and other tangible and intangible assets.  Cyber Security increases the Department's ability to provide secure services to citizens, affect foreign affairs policy, and effectively manage information flows.  If this initiative is not fully funded, the Department s ability to securely manage all of its resources will be critically compromised.","In addition to operating and maintaining the Department s Cyber Security Infrastructure, several projects in this initiative reached goals beyond the standard operational scope.  Diplomatic Security s office of computer security won the SANS National Cyber Security Innovation Award.  The Anti-virus program blocked 1 billion+ spam messages and eradicated 964 thousand viruses.  They continue to detect approximately 6,222 risks a month.

To carry out this function, the Social Security Administration's (SSA) DDS Automation program provides DDS offices with technology to collect, process, maintain, share, transmit, disseminate, store and retrieve claimant information electronically.The DDS Automation program is comprised of multiple operational systems supporting DDS offices across the country.  SSA is continuing to maintain and in limited cases improve upon functional and technical aspects of these systems to support ongoing disability determination operations while the agency develops a single system to replace the current legacy systems.  Since FY2004, SSA has incrementally enhanced the DDS legacy systems to improve their performance and maintain consistency with headquarters' system improvements and changes.  DDS Automation is closely coordinated with the Intelligent Disability (IDIB) Program.  As IDIB makes enhancements to the Electronic Folder during software releases, the DDS Automation program updates its legacy systems to accommodate these changes.Per federal capital planning best practices and guidance, SSA reviewed various alternatives for DDS Automation and determined that a common case processing system would be more beneficial to the agency than the current state-specific DDS Automation systems. Based on this analysis, the agency decided to create a common case processing system called the Disability Case Processing System (DCPS) that will replace the current DDS Automation systems. DCPS will provide a common case processing system with uniform functionality and consistent support for the business processes of DDS offices nationwide.  Until the DCPS implementation is complete, DDS Automation will continue to provide DDSs with the technology necessary to process disability claims electronically and upon the full implementation of DCPS the DDS Automation systems will be retired.","The DDS Automation program directly supports SSA's Annual Performance Plan (APP) by helping to close immediate and long term performance gaps addressed in SSA Strategic Goal 2: Improve the Speed and Quality of the Disability Process.  In doing so, the DDS Automation Program incrementally updates DDS legacy system software and hardware in order to support strategic objectives such as fast tracking cases that clearly meet disability standards and regularly updating disability policies and procedures. The goal and objective of DDS Automation is to provide enhancements and functionality that will support increased efficiency and accuracy of case processing.SSA will utilize funds for staffing support and to refine processing methods and technical capabilities to screen and fast-track disability cases.In sum, DDS Automation will continue to support SSA's mission and goals to reduce hearings and initial disability claims backlogs, and build on the tremendous progress achieved over the past few years until the full implementation of DCPS. Reduced funding will not allow SSA to achieve the incremental improvements to the disability case management process.","In FY2011, DDS Automation implemented Fiscal Payments and Electronic Records Express capabilities to all DDS Components under the Electronic Folder Initiative (EFI). These capabilities allow evidence providers to submit their requests for payment electronically to the DDS.  DDS Automation also implemented the requirements for Special Notice Option (SNO), which allows the DDSs to send and receive Title II and Title XVI blind or visually impaired claimants, beneficiaries, recipients and representative payees SSA notices and correspondences in their SNO preference format (such as Braille, audio CD, etc.).","Continued investments are required to maintain the currency and operation of hardware and software and to provide for ongoing integration with other SSA systems and other support services.

SSA performs the vast majority of our work in-house, and thus conducts EVM and program management at the total program level which includes both Government costs and support contracts. The inclusion of Earned Value in SSA contracts is based on the type of contract let, the services performed, and the date when the contract was let. When applicable per policy, Earned Value Management requirements are applied to SSA contractors in one of two ways. The first is to require the contractor to satisfy requirements in accordance with FAR 52.234. SSA currently has seven contracts that include a modified EVM FAR clause. The second is for the contractor to provide necessary data directly into SSA's in-house EVMS.SSA's in-house, program-level EVMS enables contractor efforts to be easily and separately monitored, yet produces data attributable to the component and sub-component level.Where appropriate, successor contracts to expiring SSA contracts include a modified EVM FAR clause suited to SSA's program level EVMS. Examples include the IT Support Services Contract (ITSSC) replacing the Agency Wide Support Services Contract (AWSSC), and the DCPS contract eventually replacing the Versa and Levy (Iron Data) contracts.",5,"This program is currently executing well.

016-000002135,16,Social Security Administration,0,Social Security Administration,"The purpose of the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TSRP) investment is to modernize SSA's telephone systems.  The current telephone systems were deployed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and were designed to address the agency's workload and telephone service requirements at that time.  The legacy telephone systems are a mix of three types of Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems across 1,565 locations, including field offices, hearing offices, and SSA administrative offices at large and small sites, that have limited or no future enhancement capabilities or support.  The legacy systems are now experiencing numerous difficulties, including end-of-life deterioration, an inability to obtain parts for repair, long return-to-service times, high upgrade costs, and an inability to expand to meet new workload demands, required office expansions, and program initiatives.  To improve SSA's telephone services, SSA implemented a multi-year replacement of its aged telephone systems with a centrally managed Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system which carries voice and data on the same network, saves administrative costs, and supports future technological enhancements.  SSA's centrally managed VoIP system allows calls to be re-routed during disasters and other emergencies so that unnecessary interruptions in service can be avoided.  It allows for expanded access to automated services to accommodate high demand  and supports SSA's core telephone services by reducing the busy rate and providing better accessibility to the public, such as for benefits applications, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) correspondence, disability and benefits interviews/reviews, and new/replacement Social Security Cards.  Finally, the VoIP system provides SSA options to leverage and further exploit capabilities of the new system with future enhancements, such as computer telephony integration, which, when implemented, will promote efficiency by allowing SSA agents to quickly retrieve customer data while simultaneously talking on the phone.At the end of fiscal year (FY) 2012, TSRP will become a predominantly steady-state investment as all of the systems will be updated and sustained for the rest of its 10 year systems life cycle (FY2008-FY2018).  During this period, TSRP will provide maintenance and ongoing support services on the newly installed VoIP systems. With additional funding, SSA can fully leverage TSRP system capabilities.","SSA currently handles over 35 million calls each year through TSRP.  SSA expects the number of calls to significantly increase in the coming years as the baby boomer generation begins to retire. As a result, SSA acknowledges the importance of transforming customer services, and identifies enhancing telephone services as a main objective in Strategic Goal 3 of the Agency Strategic Plan for FY2008-2013.  TSRP supports this objective by modernizing existing services to address expected increases in call volume and offer other customer service performance improvements and efficiencies. VoIP will reduce administrative costs by eliminating the need for additional infrastructure initiatives during office relocations and supporting future technological enhancements.  It will also allow for expanded access to automated services to accommodate high demand and reduce the busy rate, which will provide better accessibility to the public. The existing aged systems have limited or no enhancement capabilities as they reach the manufacturers end of life.  The existing systems would be costly to upgrade and would not offer the service improvements available with the VOIP system.Without a fully funded budget, TSRP will not have the necessary resources to implement and support the VoIP system.  As a result, SSA would be unable to provide adequate customer service as demand for services increases.  It is essential for TSRP to receive full funding in order to implement VoIP.","During FY2011, TSRP achieved 2 highlights; since the start of the project, 130 million telephone calls had been made and 80,000 telephones had been installed.  In FY2011, TSRP will have replaced a total of 467 telephone systems with the VoIP network throughout the U.S. and its Territories, including four offices in Puerto Rico and five large sites.  Additionally, as a result of the Dynamic Voice Forward on Busy project the number of first-time callers to a local field office whose calls were answered instead of receiving a busy message increased from previous years.  This was accomplished by forwarding callers to other resources.","In FY2012, TSRP will replace 114 telephone systems with the VoIP network throughout the U.S. and its Territories, including two newly planned Hearing Offices, two large sites, and 31 Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) locations in Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Hawaii, Alaska, and the Pacific Rim.  This will complete all 1,525 planned replacements.  Once all of the systems are updated, and with sufficient funding, the full exploitation of system abilities can be achieved in many ways, such as Network Skills Based Routing.  This would provide the agency with the flexibility to share agent resources between TSRP FOs.  Network Skills Based Routing would increase the answering capacity for General Inquiry callers.  The next step would be a regional pilot of the Network Skills Based Routing in FY2012.  TSRP will install enhanced call handling throughout the FOs for the General Inquiry callers being transferred to overflow groups within the office during FY2012.In FY2013, TSRP will continue to provide VOIP system maintenance and ongoing support, and if funding permits, deploy the Network Skills Based Routing to all regions.  SSA would also launch the Estimated Wait Time pilot, which offers callers an estimate of how long until their call will be answered.  Maintenance and ongoing support services will mainly consist of managed services, customer moves, and additions and changes.  SSA expects to support approximately 100 site relocations in FY2013 due to planned building renovations and expiring leases, which will include inside Service Delivery Point relocation and a large site relocation.  Additional funding will allow SSA to pursue regional pilots to exploit VOIP capabilities such as Screen Pop, a feature that would populate the Field Office (FO) agent's screen with a caller's current SSA information and thereby improve SSA's ability to provide superior customer service.",237.471,53.946,52.554,50.545,2005.0,2018.0,"We originally had money in the FY12 budget for system augmentation features (similar to the Dynamic Voice Forward on Busy feature implemented in FY11), which were cut due to agency IT funding reductions.","SSA's Earned Value Management (EVM) policy and implementation was reviewed by OMB, OIG and others and deemed consistent with the intent of OMB's M-10-27 (and its predecessors) and the ANSI standards, which define a compliant EVM System.

The first is to require the contractor to satisfy requirements in accordance with FAR 52.234. SSA currently has seven contracts that include a modified EVM FAR clause. The second is for the contractor to provide necessary data directly into SSA's in-house EVMS.SSA's in-house, program-level EVMS enables contractor efforts to be easily and separately monitored, yet produces data attributable to the component and sub-component level.Where appropriate, successor contracts to expiring SSA contracts include a modified EVM FAR clause suited to SSA's program level EVMS. Examples include the IT Support Services Contract (ITSSC) replacing the Agency Wide Support Services Contract (AWSSC), and the DCPS contract eventually replacing the Versa and Levy (Iron Data) contracts.",5,"This program is currently executing well.

It is supported by the ISS business case for infrastructure and testing as part of the EDCAPS environment. The FMSS provides the following financial management services: funds control, accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, and general ledger capabilities.  Additionally, the FMSS provides financial management reporting capabilities including the annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements, FACTS I and II reporting, SF133 reporting, etc., as well as, user reports including the Status of Funds report, Obligation Summary report, Document Summary report, Award Financial History report, etc.  The FMSS provides validation and edit checks that ensure the integrity and accuracy of the financial data for all financial transactions processed by the users and interfacing systems.  The primary beneficiaries of the FMSS include all program and administrative offices of the Department.  Other investments that the FMSS is dependent on are the Contracts and Procurement Support System (CPSS) for procurement processing, G5 for grants management, the Office of Federal Student Aid's Financial Management System (FMS) for student loan information, and the Travel Management System (TMS) for travel authorization and expenditure transactions.  The FMSS also interfaces with the Department of Treasury for payments and the Department of Interior for payroll transactions.","The Department expects to continue on its improvements in the following performance outcomes from this initiative: continued control over and accountability of Department financial management services including, financial management system controls and practices; financial system reporting capabilities and continued ability to respond quickly to internal and external financial information inquiries. Additional outcomes are continued tight integration and streamlining with the Office of Federal Student Aid (OFSA) and business processes; reduced manual reconciliation efforts for the Financial Management Operations Group within the Office of the Chief Financial Officer; reduction of errors and improved funds control; better data sharing and centralized data edits and controls that could otherwise get out of synchronization between the FMSS and other feeder systems.","In FY 2012 (PY) this investment has assisted with the successful implementation of the Continuous Controls Monitoring System and is assisting in the implementation of the electronic invoice system, Internet Payment Platform.  The audited financial statements produced by the FMSS for the prior year received a clean opinion from the Department's external auditor.  This marks the tenth consecutive year the Department has achieved this goal.  The monthly closing of the accounting periods have consistently completed within the three day window required by the users.  The quarterly FACTS reports submission to Treasury have been completed within the one week transmission window dictated by Treasury.  The 99% availability of the FMSS exceeds the target of 98%.  All helpdesk tickets have been responded to within the 24 hour goal.  The FMSS is prepared to enhance the travel interface, as necessary, in response to the migration from ETS1 to ETS2.","In FY 2013 (CY), the planned accomplishments include continuing the successes of the PY, i.e. annual financial statement clean opinion, monthly closings within three days, timely FACTS reporting, high system availability, etc. Also planning to continue to assist with the completion of the electronic invoicing system (IPP), will modify the procurement interfaces, as necessary, in response to the potential changes in the procurement (CPSS) system.  Other planned accomplishments include the completion of an analysis for a solution to the HSPD-12 government-wide intiative requiring the use of PIV cards for accessing the FMSS, solutions development for the compliance with Government-wide Treasury Account Symbol (GTAS), Treasury's TAS/BETC, and System for Award Management (SAM) requirements.  The FMSS investment will continue to support its customers with the development of reports and improved functionality as reqested.In FY 2014 (BY), in addition to the previous years successes, the planned accomplishments include the deployment of the Hyperion Budget Formulation tool to provide a solution for developing and preparing the annual budget request to congress.  Also, the FMSS must implement a solution to comply with IPv6 requirements.  Complying with IPv6 will allow the FMSS to continue to be accessible via the internet.  During FY 2014, the FMSS will begin the requirements gathering and planning in preparation for migrating to the current release of the application (Release 12).  The current version of the application (11i) will be receiving minimal support from the vendor.  There is a risk that new government-wide requirements may be issued that the current version may not be able to provide because the vendor no longer supports this version of the application.  With the upgrade of the application it is expected that there will also be a need to procure additional hardware to support the operations of the application.  It is important to note that the work planned for FY 2014 is only the requirements gathering and implemenation planning portion of the migration to Release 12.

This includes improving end-to-end processes through standardized practices and prudent application of automated information systems and to make them available to all Federal agencies. Beneficiaries are the 28 partner agencies and the more than 150 agencies, bureaus or organizations utilizing one or more tool or service provided by the BFELoB. The investment is not dependent on other investments but does interact with, and provide resources for, other investments and EGov initiatives.","Currently, most agencies do not have automated systems to support their budget formulation and execution activities; they depend on basic office software to prepare and justify complex, multi-billion dollar budgets. Hundreds of budget exercises are conducted annually without the benefit of electronic collaborative technologies. Agency budget personnel spend substantial time entering, reconciling, and merging data into textual presentations. Federal budgeting is a policy-driven process. The BFELoB enables agency and OMB budget personnel to reduce manual processes, improve efficiency and effectiveness, and redirect limited resources to a backlog of high priority analytical activities without compromising requirements or the flexibility of policy officials through the use of tools and services developed by the BFELoB. Due to significant variability in agency size, activities, organizational complexity, and congressional constituencies, solutions based on standardizing business processes and workflows are impractical for most budgeting activities. Instead, BFELoB solutions enhance Federal budgeting capabilities by: creating a community of practice for the Federal budgeting profession, identifying and hosting training and education, establishing a venue for sharing best practices, assisting agencies in implementing appropriate automation, improving tools for government-wide budget exercises and collaboration, consolidating procurements, integrating budget and finance, and establishing standards for data and data exchange. Only a portion of BFELoB solutions, approximately one-third, are IT based. The BFELoB governance is based on a &quot;value proposition&quot; in which a voluntary consortium of agencies under the auspices of the Budget Officers Advisory Council contribute funding to the BFELoB in order to gain the government-wide benefits the BFELoB provides. If the funding collected is insufficient and alternate resources are unavailable, the proposed solutions will be deferred or scaled back as determined by the contributing agencies.","The BFELoB has redesigned and deployed significant usability upgrades to the MAX Federal Community; made available cross agency customizable collaborative calendaring capability; hosted budget/finance-related training sessions attended by over 900 budget professionals; conducted an online survey to enable the BFELoB to build a baseline of budget office maturity in processes, staffing, technology use and the products they produce; developed and deployed a service allowing agencies to download account data and schema information directly from MAX A-11; developed integrated data cubing capabilities in MAX Analytics, to enable users to execute pre-defined reports and browse cubes of data using an integrated suite of online tools, one of which has revolutionized how an agency collects and reports performance data; and implemented multiple improvements to the Data Collection tool to enable more user friendly features and broaden reporting capabilities.","For FY 2013 and 2014, the Steering Committee governing the BFELoB has proposed that the BFELoB: Establish shared services and augment Shared Service offerings with integrated capabilities; develop multiple tools for data analysis, reporting, modeling, and scenario building that facilitate disaggregation ( spreading ) of high level decisions (MAX Analytics); develop additional features for MAX Federal Community, including updates for 508 accessibility, assessment of emerging technology, etc.; develop, manage, and operate a generalized central data collection exercise and tracking module with document and knowledge management capabilities (MAX Collect); incrementally convert MAX A-11 to thin client by converting the MAX A-11 schedule piece this year in time for PB2014 Budget; field an online, self-paced, multi-media training course for Budget Operating Plans; and extend MAX Authentication Services to several new agencies via single sign-on.",7.628,1.317,1.413,1.459,2007.0,2016.0,"The Summary of Funding increase this year is almost entirely in Govt FTE due to a returning reservist, gone almost all of FY11.

The IA Enhancement program consists of several critical projects.  These projects mitigate risk to the Department s information and information systems, and enable the Department to be compliant with OMB and White House cyber security mandates. This investment consists of: Enterprise Security Architecture (ESA) Continuous Monitoring (CM) Cyber Situational Awareness and Analytics (CSAA)The IAE will coordinate with three other investments: Cyber Security, Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) and Security Authorization.   All investments feed data to the IAE and also receive data from the IAE.ESA will provide the engineering framework and roadmap for the design and integration of IA capabilities, including portfolio management, strategic planning, and system security engineering support, in accordance with NIST 800-37 rev. 1, 800-53 rev. 2, 800-137, OMB M-10-15.  The ESA will include new approaches to the implementation of Department-wide Continuous Security Authorization and CM capabilities for the enterprise. The Department will begin building its CM program by focusing on OMB requirements to submit data feeds directly from a security management tool to the CyberScope FISMA reporting tool once a month according to OMB Memorandum M-10-15 FY 2010. The CM program will evaluate current processes and existing tools, and will acquire additional tools to aggregate and coordinate data from existing tools, to contribute additional data, and to score risk to enable risk-based decisions.  The Department will establish the CSAA as a cyber security technical framework to monitor and mitigate the vulnerabilities and risks to the Department s information and information systems.  The technical framework will be established as the centralized enterprise security solution that enables the network security operations center, integrates capabilities for directing the protection, analysis, and response to events on the network, automates cyber security business processes, and enables Department-wide cyber situational awareness. Establishing a fully integrated capability that supports a 24x7 ED cyber Incident Response Center (EDCIRC) requires extensive planning and integration across EDCIRC stakeholders to include the 3rd party Managed Security Service Provider and Dell.","This program will close multiple gaps in the recent EDUCATE Information Security Audit Control Number ED-OIG/A11L0001.  These gaps include resolving network security configuration vulnerabilities, use of various scanning software to identify security vulnerabilities with configuration settings for clients and servers, databases, and network infrastructure devices; fully accounting for software or hardware installed or permitted to be used on the EDUCATE network; implementation of procedures to ensure that only authorized devices are permitted to be installed on the network and to verify the number of devices permitted on the EDUCATE network.  These gaps, along with many others, will be remedied by the IAE investment through development and maturation of the 3 areas.  The ESA will provide the roadmap for the integration of IA capabilities and provide system security engineering support for the NIST 800-37, Rev. 1 Risk Management Framework to ensure appropriate security controls are in place, are effective, and can be relied upon to perform as specified during normal and abnormal system operation and when the system is attacked, misused, or stressed.  The CM program will bring about efficient management of technical controls, place extra resources on those controls that are known to protect the most vulnerabilities, streamline configuration management, create a single correlated view of all levels of network security operations, and generate dynamic and interactive visualization of i the state of information security, which will enable managers to make risk based decisions.  The CSAA program will automate and enable the day-to-day coordination and execution of security mitigation, remediation, and response actions with the Department s Network Service Providers and system owners.  The CSAA program will translate the ESA architecture into technical implementation, provide data fusion and correlation capabilities, and automate cyber security operations business The program impact of not funding will lead to failure to comply with OMB mandates and an inability to govern the Department s network security environment due to the lack of visibility into processes, security data, and overall IA/security posture.

018-000001000,18,Department of Education,10,Office of Elementary and Secondary Education,"The MSIX investment supports the transfer of migrant student records from one school to another as migrant students move across state lines.  This investment is in response to a Congressional mandate in the NCLB act Section 1308(b) that requires the Secretary to assist States develop effective mechanisms for the transfer of migrant student records on a national basis.  The MSIX investment consists of a web-based system, MSIX, that allows all State migrant programs to upload common academic and health-related information to one database and extract that informaiton when the student arrives in their state.  The investment also consists of an independent verification and validation effort to ensure the proper design, development and operation of the MSIX.  The primary beneficiaries of the MSIX are the migrant students whose records are transferred in a timely and accurate manner thus enabling the student to be quickly enrolled in the correct grade or course or have their secondary course credits accrued towards graduation.  The MSIX also leverages school demographic data collected from States by the National Center of Educational Statistics (NCES) to populate the MSIX.  This school data are uploaded and refreshed on a monthly basis.","The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 mandated that the Department of Education (ED) promote equal access to education for all students and that ED promote educational excellence throughout the nation.  The Office of Migrant Education (OME), part of ED s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), is responsible for administering the Migrant Education Program (MEP).  The MEP supports State Educational Agencies (SEAs) by providing funding to help SEAs establish or improve educational programs for migrant students.Section 1308(b) of the NCLB requires OME to assist States in developing effective methods for electronically exchanging student records among States; and, to determine and accurately account for the number of migratory children in each State.  OME established the MSIX project to satisfy these requirements and support its goals for the MEP through MSIX.MSIX allows the consolidation of replica information which will ensure timely interoperability updates between the states, without the states having to replace their current migrant student tracking systems. Once implemented, states will have access to migrant student data via a centralized system that will be coordinated at the Federal Level. Furthermore, the consolidated database will allow the states and ED to better manage student records and eliminate duplication of records and merge records as necessary.","For the prior year, MSIX completed the following milestones:Since the inception of MSIX we have increased adoption and utilization to over 45 states, including six states in Option Year 4. These six states were Utah, Mississippi, Maine, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Colorado.The data currently loaded into MSIX accounts for 99% of the nation s migrant students.The MSIX Team facilitated a full production rollout of Web Services functionality. We certified the Washington Web Services interface and approved the Washington ISA form addendum, permitting Washington to begin using Web Services in Production.The MSIX Team enhanced MSIX reporting capabilities by increasing access to  more state users and adding new reports and functionality.The MSIX Team provided ongoing user support and trouble ticket management.Five new Minimum Data Elements were successfully added to MSIX: School District ID, Home Schooled Flag, District of Residence, Residency Date, and Enrollment Comments.","For the CY and BY, MSIX will accomplish the following:- The MSIX Team will facilitate a complete equipment refresh of MSIX hardware providing increased performance, capacity, and redundancy.

018-000001010,18,Department of Education,80,Departmental Management,"Summary: EDFacts is a program of systems and services that provides Internet-based collection for K-12 education performance data; ad hoc, statistical and standard reporting; commercial-off-the-shelf software for business process management and metadata collection; the EDFacts Data Warehouse (EDW)* for centralizing K-12 data with related data from other systems; and a commercial software survey package for collections not appropriate for general data collection.  Services include data supplier conferences, data user and supplier assistance, technical assistance to states, custom reports, and training. Benefit: EDFacts makes possible the Department's FY07-12 strategic goal to achieve budget and performance integration by linking funding decisions to results.  EDFacts collects data for performance, accountability, and related information for K-12 education programs including programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and Perkins.  In addition, EDFacts provides data for the Common Core of Data (CCD).  This data is centralized with data from other ED investments such as financial grant information.  EDFacts supports policy and budget decisions with a degree of accuracy and timeliness not previously available.  Beneficiaries: The primary beneficiaries of EDFacts are states and Department program offices, who use EDFacts to assess progress of education in states and districts.  The EDFacts Reporting System is web-based and accessible by ED and states on demand.  EDFacts provides information to education authorizing committee members to support appropriation determinations.  EDFacts data is also used for special reports and to support initiatives such as Race to the Top.Dependencies: Other investments that rely on EDFacts data, infrastructure, or services include: CCD, which uses EDFacts data; Grants Administration and Payments System (GAPS) provides data to the EDFacts data warehouse to increase business intelligence; Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX), which shares master data; Risk Management System (RMS), which shares business intelligence infrastructure; Data Analysis System for grants (DANS), which receives data extracts; and Civil Rights Reporting System, which uses EDFacts data.*not to be confused with the Enterprise Data Warehouse of FSA.","Before EDFacts, K-12 data was collected by multiple, paper-based collections. Data was redundant, conflicting, incomplete, and untimely, which required costly data cleanup and validation by contractors. Because K-12 education reporting was often behind current facts by months or years, it was difficult to link performance results with decisions.  Before EDFacts, ED program offices did not have the capability to collect, analyze, and use disaggregated education data or to have an accurate and timely understanding of the status of education in the U.S.  EDFacts was developed to consolidate the multiple, disparate, paper-based education data collection efforts in order to reduce collection burden on states and to improve the quality and timeliness of data available to ED program offices and Congress.  EDFacts closed the gap, reducing time and cost to acquire education data from states and increasing data quality.  Multiple contractors that were needed for the many collections are no longer required.  Legally mandated reports that could only be delivered many months after their due dates are now delivered on time. Because a common data definition is used, it is now possible to compare programs and results and make informed, timely policy decisions.  EDFacts data is also used by states and even posted on their web sites to show how well education in the state is performing.  EDFacts is critical for insight into the performance of education programs.  If not fully funded, ED program offices, states, parents, and authorizing committee members will have little or no information about the status of education programs. What information is gathered may be of poor data quality and late.  The EDFacts system is obsolescent and needs to be modernized to keep pace with technological trends.  Reduced funding every year is exacerbating this issue.","100% customer issue resolution satisfaction, kept basic report average run time below 60 seconds as usage grew 132%, call answer speed below target except one week during cycle peak, created an alternatives analysis, implemented HSPD-12, developed Civil Rights reporting, worked with RMS project to install SAS to increase business intelligence maturity, investigated NIEM (not suitable), documented the Common Education Data Standard (CEDS)-EDFacts gap, planned a data quality improvement program (EQuIP), established a data governance (DG) board charter, improved the change management process, researched state capacities for reporting high quality data & identified state best practices to share with states. We increased EDFacts visibility in states, improved internal reporting calendars, evaluated state DG, helped states streamline processes to reduce state burden.  Improved efficiency by combining data specifications. Reduced maintenance by archiving low use, low priority reports.","In all fiscal years, EDFacts will continue to collect school year data, support data users and suppliers, and make operational improvements.FY2012: We had planned to implement changes resulting from ESEA reauthorization.  As ESEA was not reauthorized, we are implementing the interim regulatory flex changes.  The funds we planned for ESEA are now dedicated to modernizing obsolete areas of EDFacts, improving business intelligence, and improving data quality.  In FY12 we proved for SEAs that Dispute Resolution Data can be successfully collected via EMAPS; combined assessment files; satisfied early a Race to the Top request regarding assessment files; reduced CSPR manual data entry by states; moved cohort data up a year to make data current; posted file specifications earlier as we planned so data used by program offices will be earlier and states can provide better data; profiled assessment data used by OESE and OSEP as part of our data quality initiative; continued work on a common data language among ED, states, and educational organizations; improved our risk management process; achieved 100% congruency for IDEA data for EDFacts reporting; reduced effort to accommodate increased stakeholder demand by eliminating duplicative and low priority work and streamlining/reducing meetings; improved documentation and created guides to EDFacts architecture; updated servers and increased memory to reduce processing time for states, and states have reported significant improvements in data submission times.  FY 2013: We will continue data standardization work for ED, states, and educational organizations; continue critical modernization of the EDFacts system infrastructure; implement ESEA reauthorization and, along with that, create requirements for reengineering the ESS (data collection) process. We do not know when or the kinds of changes ESEA reauthorization may bring, so we have had to keep our plans flexible.FY2014: Our contract for operations and maintenance ends and we must plan funds for transition to a new contractor to reduce risk.

018-000001040,18,Department of Education,80,Departmental Management,"Integrated Support Services (ISS) was undertaken to integrate disparate systems into a single integrated financial management solution for the Department- EDCAPS. Before EDCAPS there were separate systems for grants, contracts, purchase orders, travel, and accounting. These systems didn't communicate with each other and required many manual processes and duplicate data entry. This resulted in inefficiencies, out of balance systems, and generally poor financial management capability. EDCAPS, in a first for government agencies, was able to tie these systems together resulting in: Decreased data entry requirement; More efficient business processes; Reduced paper processes; Reduced number of &quot;cuff systems&quot;; Improved financial system reporting capabilities; More accurate information; Increased system availability; Improved system performance; Improved financial management controls; Faster processing of payment requests; ISS is not a system but a bundle of services that support all the EDCAPS systems (CPSS, GAPS, FMSS, TMS). EDCAPS support is primarily provided under a single fixed price contract. ISS was created to fund those parts of the contract that benefit all EDCAPS systems, but were not directly attributable to them. This includes contractor project management and administration, database administration, system architecture planning and support, configuration management support, application and integration testing, and training support.  In addition, ISS contains funding for hardware, hardware support (break/fix), software, and software support (updates and bug fixes), that are part of the overall EDCAPS infrastructure and critical to maintaining a reliable financial system.  By providing a stable, integrated platform, ISS benefits all EDCAPS users, both internal to the Department and external.  ISS has dependencies with all the systems it supports: FMSS, CPSS, TMS, and G5; and with EDUCATE which owns and maintains the Departments IT infrastructure.","There is a need for continuous improvement of the Department's ability to manage its financial, procurement, and grant management and payment functions. ISS services help ensure that these systems continue to work together as an integrated financial management system.  If not fully funded, there is the risk of service disruptions due to hardware breakdowns or software bugs due to inability maintain currency.  Other investments such as FMSS, CPSS, TMS, and G5, which run on the EDCAPS platform maintained by ISS, would be affected.  FMSS and G5 especially, are mission critical systems and cannot be down for unplanned periods.  In addition, other services, such as help desk and training support, would have to be cut back affecting end user support and customer satisfaction.  In addition, the EDCAPS hardware is at the end of its useful life.  It needs to be replaced begining in FY13.  The current hardware is at its maximum capacity and can no longer be expanded to meet our needs.  Also, since the hardware is at end of life, parts are becoming difficult to find.  As a result, any malfunction can become a major problem.

To respond to evolving 21st century global security threats, NNSA will bring science, technology and engineering enterprise to bear on solving large, urgent national security challenges. NNSA's future mission is one encompassing the full spectrum of national security interests. The broad range of research and development activities at the NNSA laboratories includes high performance computing to ensure that the nation is equipped to deal with technological surprises and anticipate new national security threats. Because the Federal government exercises exclusive purview over nuclear weapons computations through NNSA and its weapons complex, there are no alternative public/private sector sources that could perform the Sequoia functions.Petascale computing enables problems at the high end of the computational spectrum and is the driver for the DOE/NNSA Advanced Simulation and Computing Program (ASC) steadily moving towards exascale computing capability by 2020. When it becomes available, TriLab scientists will use Sequoia through a process similar to the Capability Computing Campaign scheduling governance model supporting improved weapons physics understanding and Directed Stockpile Work, not only to maintain the nuclear deterrence, but aggressively working in areas of nonproliferation, nuclear counter terrorism, and support to the intelligence community. NNSA will further establish partnerships with other federal agencies.The CD 2/3 for Sequoia was signed Jan 8, 2009.

Dawn is a predecessor to the gargantuan 20 petaflop (quadrillion operations per second) Sequoia system, which will be delivered in the first half of 2011. At 500 teraflops, Dawn will serve as a bridge to, and accelerate the development of, the petaflop computing Sequoia will make possible. Sequoia's final system will provide peak performance of 14 to 20 petaflops in late 2012.","Problems at the highest end of this computational spectrum have been, and will continue to be, a principal driver for the ASC program as highly predictive codes are developed (as outlined in the ASC Roadmap and the evolving Predictive Capability Framework) between 2008 and 2020.  Predictive simulation is the simulation of the nuclear performance of a nuclear weapon with quantified, useful uncertainties: the caveat being that these uncertainties are small enough to contribute to certification of devices without resorting to underground tests in Nevada. There are thus two drivers for predictive simulation. The first is to meet the explicit transformation deterrence objective of having the capability to develop a weapon (with characteristics that will be determined in the future), from design to first production unit, in four years. The second is to continue to offer assurance that the behavior of existing, but aging, weapons can continue to be simulated with confidence even as they drift further from their test base, making calibration with the test base less viable in predicting performance. Both classes of systems (new and old) may well be in the stockpile between 2012 and 2030. Predictive simulation becomes the substitute for nuclear testing.The aging stockpile depends on the existence of large-scale production systems like Sequoia because such systems are necessary to move towards validated predictive capability by 2020. Simulation has become the integrating element in the ASC Program, aggregating the experimental and theoretical information into a comprehensive prediction. Prediction with confidence means the nation will not have to resort to nuclear testing, and Sequoia is a key   indispensable -  component of that evolving capability. Should this project not be fully funded, the ASC Program may execute a contractual &quot;off-ramp&quot; clause or down-size the final system, reducing the predictive capability and confidence in the safety of the nuclear stockpile.",Integrated the Sequoia ID (Dawn) system into the classified environment and brought the system into General Availability (GA) status. A technical assessment (go/no-go) checkpoint was held with LLNL and the extended tri-lab community.   A  Go  decision was awarded. The bring-up and verification of DD2.0 at 512 way scale has been completed. This event has provided additional confidence that another revision of this design is not required.   The official entry into the next formal System Test phase (ST) was achieved with the first 1024 way rack with DD2.0 level parts.

It replaces WAPA CSO Cost Recovery BIDSS.  Western reports only appropriated funding in Exhibits 53 and 300.  Therefore, dollar figures throughout this Exh. 300 show not the full BIDSS II costs, but rather only that portion funded by appropriations.The initial phase of the BIDSS II investment life cycle is the DME project to upgrade and implement Western's financial management system to version R12 (BIDSS R12 Upgrade), which began June 2011.  This project will go-live to production BIDSS II at end of the second quarter of FY13 and project finish in May 2013.   Standard development activities occurring in FY11 are Analysis and Requirements.  FY12 activities include Design, Development, and Testing.   FY13 activities include Testing, Training, and Deployment.  Project Management and Communication occur through the project.   BIDSS II and the R12 Upgrade project are closely interdependent with Western's Maximo Maintenance/Asset Management system.The project to implement BIDSS II is divided into sub-projects that comprise the work associated with upgrade iterations, referred to as &quot;&quot;Sets,&quot;&quot; in order to provide value deliverables in a shorter term.  Set 1 Analysis and Set 1 Requirements are segments that will delivery Analysis and Requirements documentation, as well as a refinement of project plans and resources projections, to be approved by Western management at CD-2 prior to proceeding with Design and Development.  Iteration Set 2 is the cycle of Design, Development, and Testing leading to System Integration Testing and CD-2B, approval of the BIDSS II design.   Iteration Set 3 is the next cycle of Development and Testing leading to Functional Testing.  Iteration Set 4 is the final cycle of Development and Testing leading to User Acceptance Testing and also including User Training.  Deployment and Set 5 is the implementation of BIDSS II into production, with approval of CD-3.  Post-Deployment resolves any remaining system issues, knowledge transfer, and project closing with approval of CD-4.Ongoing Operations follow in the life-cycle years subsequent to the upgrade project.  This comprises the O&amp;M phase of the BIDSS II investment, beginning in FY13 and continuing through the investment lifecycle ending FY19.","BIDSS II s the replacement of Western's previous financial application (WAPA CSO Cost Recovery BIDSS).  The existing investment is at end of life.  BIDSS II has reimbursable investment expenditure data, financial data, budget, and customer project data.  The BIDSS II product uniquely handles a wide variety of financial data necessary to the operation and marketing of the bulk electric power mission at Western.  It is also the source system of record used to produce financial reports.  It also meets security requirements by avoiding processing critical financial information using software which the vendor no longer supports, therefore minimizing the risk of security vulnerabilities, and minimizing licensing and software maintenance costs.  Multiple alternatives were analyzed and this investment represents the option which best minimizes risks and costs for Western.If BIDSS were not funded, the impact to Western would be to increase risks, increase costs over the long term, and ultimately limit Western's ability to carry out its mission.  Without the upgrade to BIDSS II (Oracle Financials R12), Western would have to continue to use the old BIDSS system beyond its intended lifecycle and increasingly beyond the period of vendor support.  This would not only require a more costly level of in-house technical support, but it would also run an increasingly higher risk of system failure and the need for an unplanned and more costly upgrade at the time of that failure.  While addressing such failure, Western s ability to perform its mission would be jeopardized. Western would also not benefit from the functional enhancements that R12 provides.  Moreover, Western s approach to enterprise systems is to utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, so that not upgrading now would not avoid any costs but merely postpone them, since all of the patches and upgrades would eventually have to be implemented anyway, in order to continue operation of the COTS product.","Past Year (PY11)  Conducted Analysis.

W/o this highly integrated HPC resource within the EMSL facility, the MSCF s more than 200+ users would be unable to quickly verify molecular-level experimental results, thereby significantly slowing publication of findings relevant to DOE missions and making it impossible to iterate between computation &amp; experiment in real-time. Current cloud platforms do not provide sufficient capacity, performance or quality of service for scientific parallel codes needed by EMSL users. MSCF's HPC is one EMSL tool in DOE's efforts to predict the movement and remediation of contaminants at DOE sites, understand &amp; enhance catalysis and biofuels processing, and investigate the coupling of chemical, biological and physical processes at the molecular level. Time on MSCF s HPC is made available to users from DOE's basic research and applied R&amp;D programs, and to users funded by other Federal agencies (e.g. NSF, NIH, USGS, DOD, EPA).MSCF maintains a steady state operation. Through operations funding to EMSL, the HPC is replaced every 3-4 yrs by leasing commercially available hardware through fixed price contracts in accordance with DOE's Project Management Order, as overseen by the Office of Project Assessment in DOE's Office of Science (SC).

The primary compute cluster, a production system named Chinook, exceeded the 97% availability target for FY11 with over 90% of the cycles used for EMSL s science theme users. During FY11, an additional 1.5 petabytes of usable archive space was made available to users, and the response time to address user issues was well below the target of 120 minutes.","In CY12 and BY13, this investment will prepare the facility for, and plan and execute the procurement of a new higher performance midrange HPC system, HPCS-4a.  It will continue to operate the existing HPCS-3 (Chinook) HPC system, and augment the tape and disk capacity of the EMSL data archive system.Expected scientific accomplishments include:  Develop fundamental catalytic surface characterization simulations for biomass conversion to ethanol using rhodium catalysts.   Combine electronic structure computational simulation with cryogenic NMR experiments to understand photosynthetic energy conversion systems.   Use NMR and computational biochemistry to determine conformational changes within an active enzyme/substrate on both sides of the reaction.

Also, the prevailing requirement to print records to paper in the absence of an electronic recordkeeping system places EPA at risk when not adhered to by its employees.  EPA's inability to quickly produce documents has cost millions of dollars in staff time and court fines.  ECMS reduces inefficiencies by providing a scalable document repository for the management of Agency information.  ECMS automates EPA's records and document management activities and provides its more than 23,000 employees and contractors the capability to query and find information quickly while ensuring integrity, consistency and accuracy of information.  ECMS has been included as a mandatory Working Capital Fund (WCF) Service since FY07.  Region/Program specific applications have leveraged the content management license and core processing infrastructure.  Developmental costs for these Program-specific applications are not covered under this investment (e.g., Correspondence Management System (CMS), electronic Inventory Update Rule (eIUR), Web CMS, Electronic Grants Records System (EGRS), etc.).   Since FY 07, EPA staff have been provided the capability to archive email records.  Between FY 08 and 11, enhancements were developed to improve system performance.  In BY 11 and 12, existing agency applications will be linked to the ECMS system to capture and preserve the final agency records.  The planned system capability is expected to be completed by 2014 with continued enhancements and ongoing operations and maintenance in the following years.","The ECMS investment supports the Agency's Strategic Plan by facilitating cross-Agency collaborative working, information sharing, and records management through the use of its records management functionality.   The ECMS will continue to grow to contain a rich repository of organized and searchable Agency information, both records and documents - - centrally storing and preserving data and analyses for use today as well as preserving the information as a primary knowledge assets for the future. The system will promote greater collaboration and efficiency as it will enable EPA employees to collaborate on electronic documents without leaving their offices.  Every EPA employee will access the ECMS repository from his or her desktop.  Significant efficiencies will result.  ECMS will enable comprehensive searches of Agency documents from any desktop thereby reducing document search time and improving the quality of responses to public, Congressional, and other information requests.Without the requested full funding, the ongoing development and enhancement of the ECMS application, provided by contractor support, will be significantly reduced.  This would further push out the planned transition to the anticipated operations and maintenance phase in 2014.","In FY11, the ECMS PMO moved help desk support in-house, which increased the percentage of tier 1 resolutions; final results TBD.  In FY11, the PMO developed a new technique to auto-register employees using PeoplePlus data, which will boost registrations; final results TBD.  In FY11, the PMO completed connections to two agency systems for records transfer: the Correspondence Management System (CMS) and Electronic Grants Records System (EGRS).","In CY (FY12), the ECMS PMO will develop a survey to measure customer satisfaction on a 5-point scale, with a goal of 80% (baseline) to 90% (target) 4+ average rating.In CY (FY12), the PMO will continue to auto-register employees, with a goal of 60% (baseline) to 70% (target).In CY (FY12), the PMO will establish connections with 1 (baseline) or 2 (target) agency systems for records transfer.In CY (FY12), the ECMS storage amount will reach 450GB (baseline) to 550GB (target).In CY (FY12), the PMO will begin to deploy a new Email Records application agency-wide.In BY (FY13), the ECMS PMO will migrate two existing applications to AJAX: Identity Self Service (ISS) and the Organization Administration Tool (OAT).In BY (FY13), the PMO will develop an auto-classification process for records captured via the new Email Records application.",20.827,4.192,3.554,6.518,2006.0,2020.0,0,The only contract awarded in support of the this investment that did not require EVM was the original acquisition for a software fixed price contract put in place to purchase the enterprise-wide license of Documentum software.

The PPL-HR application is a solution for managing employee's federal HR lifecycle. It automates many administrative tasks that require a great deal of time, allowing HR staff to focus on core business functions.  By streamlining the majority of administrative task, HR Managers can focus on strategic activities such as recruitment, workforce planning & competency management to align employee skills with organizational objectives.  This investment is currently in the O&M lifecycle.  EPA has developed a strategy for migrating HR IT data/system functionality to a Human Resource Line of Business (HRLoB) Shared Service Center (SSC) which began in FY2011.  A strategy is planned for transitioning EPA historical records from the current Peoplesoft production IT system to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS) at the Department of Interior.  Derived benefits of this migration strategy will be to align with Federal HR LoB requirements, enhance HR processing and reports management, and provide a workflow solution to improve Agency HR processing efficiencies.  In FY2013 & FY2014, additional funding will be requested to cover continuing PPL-HR migration activities and decommission of the current system.","This investment supports the Agency mission and published strategic goals to promote efficient and effective HR IT system solutions.  The President s Management Agenda (PMA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Human Resources Line of Business (HRLoB) require federal agencies select Shared Service Centers (SSC) to manage its HR personnel and payroll services.  The Agency selected a Human Resources (HR) SSC to serve as their provider ensuring standardization of the federal HR functions to improve effectiveness, reduce costs, and provide better service and value to stakeholders. Based on EPA's business needs, a provider was selected who had proven best practices for standardizing HR operations, policies and procedures, and simplified and better integrated payroll, human resources, and finance functions.  In support of the HRLoB, EPA chose the Department of Interior National Business Center (DOI-NBC), as their HR provider. DOI-NBC's HR technology offers HR transactional processing, compensation management and payroll processing, benefits administration, time and attendance, and HR reporting. The PeoplePlus Human Resources System is co-owned by OCFO and OARM.  PPL-HR provides personnel transactional support, and is the system of record for HR and benefit actions.  PPL-HR interfaces HR action data to the DOI-DFAS payroll system to ensure Agency employees are paid accurately. In addition to EPA migrating its personnel functions to NBC s Federal Personnel Payroll System (FPPS), the payroll and time and attendance functions will be migrated from DFAS and PeoplePlus to NBC s hosted FPPS and Kronos webTA.  Successful migration of all components is dependent on a well planned strategy and execution. An internal assessment of the Agency's inability to fully fund this investment has determined that EPA would be subject to varied risk and IT system lifecycle vulnerabilities associated with maintaining a viable HRIT system that supports necessary technological advancements and employee HRIT support services; in addition, affects our ability to confirm with OMB and OPM mandated requirements for Agencies to migrate their HRIT systems to shared service centers.","Completion of a fit gap analysis with DOI-NBC; development of an integrated project plan; signed interagency agreement; established project charter; draft communications strategy;  first cut at data mapping/data clean-up strateg; draft risk management plan.  EPA is working very closely with representatives from the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Interior, National Business Center to follow necessary Agency migration reporting reqiurements.  EPA has implemented weekly, biweekly, and monthly business meetings with various partners to support of the full migration strategy, implemented various forms of communication outreach vehicles for engaging Agency-wide employees, and has continued to receive support from EPA key senior officials for process success and checkpoint approvals.   PPL-HR maintained the DOD-DFAS interfaces; supported EPA SSC training; HR transaction and pay issue resolutions.","Current year planned list of phased approach pre-migration accomplishments are as follows:-An Interagency Agreement was signed in May 2011 between EPA and DOI-NBC for HR and Payroll to begin preliminary planning and pre-migration activities to align with NBC systems.  -Two Kick-Off meetings were held.  One focused on HR functions and pre-migration business processes per NBC lead direction.  The second Kick-Off meeting focused on the identification and formulation of various workgroups and project executive sponsors (representatives from the three primary AAs (OARM, OCFO, OEI)) in support of this effort. -Development of key project management documentation such as the project charter, integrated project plan, communications strategy, and first newsletter and HR LoB blog to go live soon.

021-161006572,21,Department of Transportation,12,Federal Aviation Administration,"Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) is the FAA's modernization program for oceanic air traffic control. With ATOP, the FAA significantly reduces the intensive manual processes that today limit the ability of controllers to safely handle airline requests for more efficient tracks or altitudes over long oceanic routes. This investment also allows the FAA to meet international commitments of reducing aircraft separation standards thereby dramatically increasing capacity and efficiency. Specifically this investment: - Fully integrates flight and radar data processing - Detects conflicts between aircraft - Provides satellite data link communication and surveillance capabilities - Removes the need for paper flight strips - Automates manual processesToday ATOP is being used to control air traffic at all three oceanic sites: Oakland, Calif., New York, N.Y. and Anchorage, Alaska Air Route Traffic Control Centers using an integrated oceanic system. Now fully deployed, ATOP manages approximately 80 percent of the world's managed oceanic airspace, including approximately 24 million square miles over the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans. New capabilities offered by the ATOP system have increased capacity for international air travel and automated the manual processes previously used by controllers. The primary beneficiaries of this investment are the airlines and the flying public. ATOP is currently mixed lifecycle with both safety and efficiency enhancements and sustainment activities. ATOP has a dependency on the following systems: ERAM, ADS-B, WARP, NNEW, CATMT, TFM and FTI.","Before ATOP, there was limited aircraft tracking and direct communications for oceanic air traffic. Pilots would radio position reports based on onboard aircraft navigational systems to the controller. Due to this uncertainty in position report reliability, overseas flights required greater separation margins to ensure safe flight, and were rarely able to obtain maximum fuel efficiency, minimum travel times, or access to preferred flight paths. Today, ATOP allows oceanic controllers to be in touch with aircraft in mid-oceanic flight thereby allowing properly equipped aircraft and qualified aircrews to operate using reduced oceanic separation criteria while preserving passenger safety and improving efficiency. This enables more aircraft to fly optimal routes, enhancing aircraft flight time as well as fuel and payload efficiency during the oceanic legs of their flights. Additionally reducing lateral (side-to-side) separation may provide space for additional routes between current locations or new direct markets. Reducing longitudinal (nose-to-tail) separation may provide more opportunities to add flights without delays. If funding is reduced the safety and efficiency enhancements would have to be proportionately reduced and the sustainability of the operational system would be deteriorated.  Also, depending on the size of the funding reduction several FAA initiatives such as ICAO 2012 implementation, Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) transition from the FDP/MEARTS ATC system to the Ocean21 system, establishing an ARCTIC flight information Region (FIR), and improvements to New York ARTCC control of Bermuda air traffic flow may not be implemented.","The ATOP systems have operated at a 99.99 % availability rate and systems enhancements have been added that allow safer and more efficient air traffic coordination. In FY 2011 the ATOP program was able to provide the capability for Oceanic Centers to implement the new international ICAO 2012 standards and operational procedures, and update the interface standard from the old X.25 protocol to the new Internet Protocol (IP) standard. Software enhancements were provided to allow air traffic controllers to issue automated tailored arrival clearances, allow better access to aircraft messages and improved the aircraft alert list functionality. The program also added functionality to ATOP to allow New York Center to better monitor Bermuda flights. In addition to the enhancements, software maintenance provided 310 software fixes to improve the day-to-day operation of the air traffic control capability.","In FY 2012: 1.) Allow processing of airlines preferred arrival routes for more efficient coordination between Oceanic and other air traffic facilities.   2.) Allow the ATOP system to automatically process remove strip messages from other air traffic control systems instead of manually.   3.) Allow automated conformance checking of National Air Space (NAS) amendments to reduce manual processing of flight plan amendments.  4.) Allow the ATOP system to automatically process aeroradio format messages versus controllers processing them manually.  5.) Provide ATOP changes required for the FAA to allow the Airlines to access aircraft conflict probe data to more efficiently route their aircraft.  6.) System maintenance is projected to deliver approximately 350 additional software fixes. In FY 2013: 1.) Provide hardware and software changes for use in the FAA's Anchorage oceanic, offshore and transition airspace. 2.) The automation is intended to address functional deficiencies and inefficiencies in the current automation, consistent with the FAA's Strategic Plan for Oceanic Airspace Enhancements and Separation Reductions. 3.)

021-142305975,21,Department of Transportation,12,Federal Aviation Administration,"The Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) program office is implementing Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a surveillance system designed to provide improved air traffic information for pilots and air traffic controllers. ADS-B supports the FAA mission and goals to increase economic competitiveness and safety, influencing the performance metrics for Average Daily Airport Capacity and National Airspace System (NAS) On-Time Arrivals. This investment provides operational, user and government benefits, and directly contributes to the FAA mission of reducing congestion and providing increased capacity in the NAS.ADS-B also facilitates the transition to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). ADS-B is the cornerstone technology for NextGen and promises to significantly increase efficiency and enhance safety by broadcasting aircraft position based on precise signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System - effectively tracking and managing air traffic. ADS-B provides more accurate, timely and comprehensive surveillance information. The aircraft's ADS-B Out equipment processes position information and flight parameters such as identification, indication of climb or descent angle, velocity, next waypoint, and other data for a periodic broadcast transmission, typically once a second, to the ADS-B ground station. This information will be used for surveillance applications and Air Traffic Services Displays on automation systems such as En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM), Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS), Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), HOST, and Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP). Nearby aircraft equipped with ADS-B In avionics may receive and process surveillance information for display to the pilot using the aircraft's multifunction display. Pilots use the display to enhance situational awareness of the surrounding airspace. ADS-B equipment may also be placed on ground vehicles to allow controllers and pilots to locate and identify them when they are on runways or taxiways. This program has dependencies with ERAM, STARS, Airport Surface Detection Equipment -Model X (ASDE-X), Traffic Management Advisor-Single Center (TMA), Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement (TAMR) and Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP).","While current surveillance methods are generally adequate for today's environment, these surveillance methods will not support continued aviation growth without loss of efficiency within the NAS. As the request for additional services and traffic demand increases, system inefficiencies will increase in the form of delays and restrictions across the NAS. The current surveillance systems do not take advantage of new technologies in navigation, communication, and flight management. Expansion of surveillance coverage is essential to support air traffic control modernization efforts. According to the Joint Government and Industry Roadmap for Surveillance Modernization, the Air Traffic environment of the future will be increasingly dependent on more accurate and timely information being available to Air Traffic Service providers and aircraft operators. Information pertaining to a variety of airspace conditions and accurate position data, including aircraft intent, will be necessary. With ADS-B, pilots will see what controllers see: displays showing other aircraft in the sky. Cockpit displays also pinpoint hazardous weather and terrain, and give pilots important flight information, such as temporary flight restrictions. ADS-B also reduces the risk of runway incursions with cockpit and controller displays that show the location of aircraft and equipped ground vehicles on airport surfaces. ADS-B applications, currently being developed, will give pilots direct warnings of potential collisions. ADS-B also provides greater coverage since ground stations are so much easier to place than radar. Remote areas without radar coverage, like the Gulf of Mexico and parts of Alaska, now have surveillance with ADS-B. Relying on satellites instead of ground navigational aids also means aircraft will be able to fly more directly from Point A to B, saving time and money, and reducing fuel burn, noise and emissions. The improved accuracy, integrity and reliability of satellite signals over radar means controllers eventually will be able to safely reduce the mandatory separation between aircraft and increase capacity in the nation's skies. Failing to complete the ADS-B infrastructure implementation due to lack of funding would result in loss of the business benefits that were identified as part of the ADS-B business case. Stakeholders would delay equipping aircraft, resulting in further reductions in benefits and the need to re-accomplish the rule for equipage by 2020.","- Released Request for Offer (ROF) to replace 9 ASDE-3/AMASS systems with Airport Surface Surveillance Capability. - Obtained the decision for expansion of SBS at the Anchorage ARTCC.- Developed ADS-B automation requirements for ATOP.- Updated the ADS-B Performance Route Strategy Plan.- Completed Target Level of Safety draft Performance and Safety Assessment for En Route 3 Nautical Mile.- Obtained approval of the ITT Design covering Critical and Multilateration Services for Colorado Phase 2 Service Volumes.- Began In Trail Procedures evaluation flights in the Pacific.- Began implementation of Essential and Critical Services for 40 Service Volumes.- Delivered Industry recommendations for incorporating ADS-B In into the NAS through the use of the ADS-B In ARC.- An Aviation Rulemaking Committee will make recommendations for the implementation of ADS-B applications requiring a cockpit display by 9/30/11, with detail and next steps by June 2012.","In CY2012 the program will include the following activities: - Continue NAS-Wide deployment of ADS-B.- Develop ADS-B software for the Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) automation platform.- Completion of Initial Operating Capability (IOC) at Montrose Key Site - Colorado WAM Phase 2.- Completion of Critical Services Implementation Service Acceptance Testing at 33 Service Volumes.- Completion of Initial Operating Capability (IOC) - Surface Advisory Services at 10 Sites.- Completion of Initial Operating Capability (IOC) - Terminal ATC Separation Services at 27 Sites.- Continue development of future applications: Ground-Based Interval Management - Spacing development and deployment Flight Deck Based Interval Management - Spacing flight trials In Trail Procedures Operational Evaluation Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerts. - Subscription Fees: Subscription Fees are being included as a Project and Activities in the E300 Part B.1 and B.2 tables.

021-996986499,21,Department of Transportation,12,Federal Aviation Administration,"The Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) provides direct mission support to the FAA by ensuring efficient flow of air traffic through the National Airspace System (NAS). TFMS is the automation backbone for the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) and the nationwide Traffic Management Units that assist the ATCSCC in strategic planning and management of air traffic.  The TFM system is the nation's primary source for capturing and disseminating flight information across the aviation community.  The TFMS automation and communication mechanisms support the decision-making process used to adjust flight schedules and/or routes as necessary.  When the NAS is impacted by severe weather, congestion, and/or outages, the TFMS has unique capabilities to predict chokepoints and facilitate the collaboration and execution of mitigation initiatives with stakeholders to minimize NAS delays. The TFMS is the access point for essential data exchange with airlines, General Aviation, Homeland Security, DoD, and international service providers. TFMS also serves as a source for travel data to the public.  The first useful and pre-Next Generation (NextGen) segment of this investment is composed of Traffic Flow Management- Modernization (TFM-M) and Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT) Work Package 1 (WP1), which were baselined as a single useful segment by the FAA's Joint Resources Council (JRC) on August 1, 2005.  Completed in FY11, TFM-M modernized the operating hardware and software, and CATMT WP1 added new software capabilities.  A new segment, TFM Infrastructure Technical Refresh (FY11-15), was approved by the FAA JRC on March 29, 2011.  This new segment provides a replace-in-kind technology refresh of the hardware providing the central data processing capability for TFMS.  The program replaces the  HW of the TFM Processing Center (TPC) and TFMS legacy application,  National Traffic Management Log (NTML), located at the William J Hughes Technology Center (WJHTC); it's back up at the Disaster Recovery Center (DRC); and prime contractor site. Last replaced in 2006, the HW is no longer produced, will become unsupported and unable to support future processing needs. The HW must be replaced to avoid obsolescence, system performance degradation and impact to other programs. This program has dependencies with the following programs and or systems: AIM, FTI, ERAM, ERAM D Position, ATOP, SWIM, TMA-TBFM, DATACOMM, NNEW, and CATMT WP2 and CATMT WP3.","The FAA must maintain mission essential operations at its 81 TFM-equipped ATC facilities and 41 external sites for its customers and continue to provide enhanced TFM services.  The TFM System provides direct mission support to the FAA by ensuring efficient flow of air traffic through the NAS.  Reduction in funding would jeopardize the performance and operational availability of the TFMS, potentially affecting the performance of other FAA systems, overall efficiency in the NAS; as well as reduced NAS delay savings.  Additionally, the TFMS Technical Refresh would take longer and cost more thus increase maintenance costs and impact the concurrent development of the NextGen CATMT WP2 and WP3 capabilities.  This investment's 1st segment performance gaps are: unused airport capacity; excessive ground delay, avoidable ground delay, excessive airborne delay, excessive restrictions, and lack of predictability. Through the 1st segments modernization of the TFM system and development and deployment of CATMT Work Package 1 capabilities, it is anticipated these gaps will be partially closed through the lifecycle, reducing delays associated with disruptive events. .  The TFM Technical Refresh replaces HW of the core elements of the TFM System, a major NAS system and the development platform for NextGen CATMT initiatives.  As such, the TFMS Technical Refresh program enables the TFM and CATMT programs to achieve their objectives. Currently the TFM System exceeds the current hardware processing specifications and as a result, experiencing performance degradation.  Performance degradation forecasts have not taken into account the planned CATMT WP2 and WP3 functionality, which will utilize the same hardware. Therefore there is added risk that the increased utilization due to the additional functionality will accelerate performance degradation. The TFMS Technical Refresh improves performance by replacing the hardware providing the central data processing capability for the TFM System.  Additionally, TFMS hardware, last replaced in 2006-7 is facing obsolescence; the TFMS HW is no longer produced and will no longer be supported in the next 0 -2 years. Though spares can be found to mitigate outages times due to failures, spares will not alleviate the performance degradation.  Funds are needed at the requested level to purchase hardware and continue the technology refresh installation activities for the TFM Processing Center at the William J. Hughes Technology Center."," TFM completed its first program segment, TFM-M/CATMT WP1, with deployment of the modernized TFM System software in 2010 and deployment in PY11 of the final 2 CATMT WP1 software enhancements, Reroute Impact Assessment (RRIA) and Execution of Flow Strategies (XFS). RRIA deployed in January 2011 in TFMS Release 4.  This enhancement assists TFM specialists better assess airspace demand/capacity imbalances as well as impacts of possible solutions to avoid unnecessary NAS user delay. XFS deployed in June 2011 in TFMS Release 5 and will be operational after ERAM is deployed nationally.  XFS automates the communication of pre-departure reroutes from the TFM system to ERAM for controller execution. The modernized TFM system with CATMT enhancements provides National Air Space (NAS) user delay savings as well as FAA user workload savings. A new segment TFMS Technical Refresh (FY11-15) was approved and started in PY11 to avoid hardware obsolescence and support the CATMT enhancements.","CY12 Continue and complete the initial activities for risk reduction of the TFMS Technical Refresh, which are the engineering analysis and purchase of system hardware spares. The current TFMS hardware are no longer produced. Spares of current critical equipment are needed to help keep current TFM system fully functional until TFMS Technical Refresh is completely accomplished, by minimizing outages due to equipment failure and as a result minimizes impact to concurrent development of the CATMT WP2 and WP3 capabilities on the system.   Continue first phase of the TFMS Technical Refresh activities to replace the hardware of the TFMS legacy application, National Traffic Management Log (NTML).  The first phase activities, occurring in CY12, include; completion of the NTML engineering analysis, procurement of NTML replacement hardware, and conduct test and installation of the NTML replacement hardware.

The process has been validated by an independent EVM review and TFM received a green rating. All work performed using Level-of-Effort (LOE) arrangements will be defined by Task Orders prior to the performance of any work by a contractor. These various contract types allow the government to provide an incentive to the contractor in critical cost intensive areas to meet project costs while meeting performance and schedule goals. Status reviews are conducted monthly to ensure progress against goals. Part of the overall strategy has always been to separate the individual statements of work into small manageable portions so that if a contractor does not perform, that contractor will be replaced, with minor impact to the TFM effort. The support service contractors are currently Level of Effort contracts/task orders.  These are LOE contracts/tasks orders in support of the government activities required to complete the program.

Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.  Runway entrance lights (REL) signal to aircraft crossing or entering a runway from an intersecting taxiway when it is unsafe to do so. Takeoff hold lights (THL) let pilots in position for takeoff know if another aircraft is crossing or entering the runway.RWSL has dependencies with the following investments: Airport Surface Detection Equipment Model X (ASDE-X), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI). RWSL requires the ASDE-X surveillance data which it receives through an interface with the ASDE-X Data Distribution Unit (DDU).  San Francisco International (SFO) is the only designated RWSL airport without an ASDE-X system.  Therefore, the installation of RSWL at SFO is dependent on the installation of the ADSB Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC), a multilateration only capability being deployed to select airports with no ASDE-X in support of NextGen.",The RWSL Program directly supports the DOT Strategic Plan and FAA Destination 2025 Goal Areas of Safety and Next Level of Safety respectively.

This infrastructure enables the ASKME program and its applications that support new aircraft certification, plus the SASO program and its applications that collect information on the safety records of aviation operators and aviation maintenance companies.Segment 2 will upgrade and improve the hardware and software that help safety inspectors integrate information from these databases to improve their oversight of the industry.  It will also increase the rate of data transfer from centralized databases to their mobile devices.  Improving the rate of data transfer will increase the time available for safety inspections.  The portable devices that inspectors use during field work to maintain connection with the available databases will be updated to keep up with technological change. Segment 2 will also upgrade the protection of safety data systems to prevent this important data from being destroyed by natural disaster.  It will improve protection of the facility where the data is stored and prevent access to the data by unauthorized users.Program activities include lifecycle replacement and acquisition of the following IT infrastructure components supporting AVS's Safety Workforce: mobile tablet personnel computers; telecommunications services; application servers and data storage devices (hosting national AVS safety applications); and COTS Software licenses.

021-391613792,21,Department of Transportation,12,Federal Aviation Administration,"Future air traffic operations as envisioned by the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System will require a new flexible networkable voice communications system with flexible networking capabilities. Needs have been identified for: efficient use of communications resources to reduce acquisition and support costs; elimination of constraints on expansion of capacity and supportability imposed by parts obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources; support of dynamically defined airspace; maintenance of business continuity in the event of a loss of a facility; elimination of architectural constraints on system capacity; and increased sophistication of system security to counter threats. Currently, thirteen different switches are used in the NAS and many are already experiencing severe obsolescence issues. Technical refresh can sustain the Enroute Voice Switching and Control Systems (VSCS) for the near term but a new switch system is needed to alleviate supportability issues. Also, current voice switches are not network enabled and cannot be modified for installation in new facilities resulting from NextGen. The National Airspace System (NAS) Voice System (NVS) is the key voice communication component for the NextGen System to satisfy these needs and NVS has been identified as a key enabling program for NextGen. The NVS is currently in a planning phase. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Executive Council (EC), sub-board to the Joint Resource Council (JRC); Investment Analysis Readiness Decision took place in September 2007. A strategy brief was presented to the JRC in July 2010 in place of an Initial Investment Decision (IID) as previously planned. At this strategy JRC, the IID was waived and segmentation of the program was defined. Since the IID was waived, analysis supporting many of the performance measurements was not completed and performance measurements for FY09-10 were not met. Subsequent budget cuts of $130.2M from the passback for FY12-16 led to restructuring the planned approach. During this first segment, several demo and test systems will be procured, but not deployed. A Final Investment Decision (FID) is planned for FY15 prior to system deployment. This program has dependencies with Next Generation Air/Ground Communications Segment 1a and Segment 2, FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure, Voice Switching and Control System, and Alaskan Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure.","FAA has established an operational plan for the Air Traffic Management (ATM) system of the twenty-first century.  This plan, reflected in the Concept of Operations for NextGen, will restructure the NAS.  These concepts will involve new rules and regulations governing the use of airspace, new technologies that enable air traffic services, new airspace structure, and dynamics for adapting the NAS to meet user needs.  At the same time, NAS voice communications infrastructure continues to age and operational analyses continue to identify opportunities to co-locate or consolidate facilities.  Needs associated with these changes are addressed in the FAA Flight Plan goals and objectives, Strategic Management Plan objectives, and the NAS Enterprise Architecture.To provide Air Traffic Control (ATC) voice communication services the NVS will be needed.  In both the near and long term, the NVS will provide solutions for the efficient use of communications resources to reduce acquisition and support costs, as well as eliminate the constraints on expansion of capacity and supportability imposed by parts obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources. As the NAS evolves toward the future defined by the NextGen concept, the need for voice communication will be reduced but will not be eliminated.  The NVS will therefore address both current needs while evolving the infrastructure toward the future.  The NVS will provide a common platform for voice communications that complements the evolving data communications infrastructure that will be used to an increasing degree to accomplish tasks previously allocated to voice communications. By providing new network enabled voice switches throughout the NAS, NVS supports the DOT Strategic Plan goal of maintaining operational availability of the NAS at 99.7 percent, and also supports the similar FAA Destination 2025 goal of Optimizing Airspace and Performance Based Management Procedures to improve efficiency an average of 10% across Core Airports by 2018.  If NVS is not fully funded and the old switches remain in place for an extended period of time, voice communication in the NAS will be subject to equipment obsolescence issues and failures, and the current architectural constraints on system capacity will persist.","In the PY, NVS has released the strategy paper for industry comment, and also requested industry comments on the draft technical specifications.  Other accomplishments include conducting the Voice over IP (VoIP) interoperability tests, as well as providing an updated briefing to the JRC, and the release of a draft of the Screening Information Request (SIR) for industry comment.  These accomplishments over the last year have positioned NVS for future success in the upcoming budget year.","In the current year, NVS plans to incorporate the industry comments into the SIR, as well as complete the system specification. Once complete, the plan will be available for financial review and eventual approval. The SIR will then be released to the industry and NVS will conduct evaluations on all the returning proposals. Once a proposal has been accepted, NVS will award a contract to acquire test systems in order demonstrate NextGen capabilities and have a production-ready system for deployment to any target environment.

021-097274776,21,Department of Transportation,12,Federal Aviation Administration,"The Next Generation Air/Ground Communications (NEXCOM) Segment 2 program is the second phase of NEXCOM whose mission is to modernize aging air to ground (A/G) equipment infrastructure used for air traffic control (ATC).  NEXCOM Segment 2 addresses the air traffic voice channels for aircraft flying in the Terminal and Flight Services environment (below 24,000 feet) of the National Airspace System (NAS). ATC is provided in the NAS by a combination of control and remote facilities. Control facilities are assigned specific airspace responsibilities over which to provide ATC services. Associated with each control facility are remote communications facilities (RCFs) where radios are located. Remote transmitter/receiver (RTR) locations provide a service for Terminal airspace. In some instances, the FAA retains control of remote communications outlets (RCOs) associated with flight services control facilities (AFSS/FSS). RCOs provide flight planning and advisory services. NEXCOM Segment 2 will focus on replacing air to ground voice communication radios at 1814 RTR and RCO sites. The program expects completion by 2027. The modernization of key A/G elements, such as VHF (Very High Frequency) and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) radios, antennas and cabling, under NEXCOM Segment 2 will ensure the continued operation of the ATC system. NEXCOM Segment 2 received a JRC Authorization to Proceed in December 2010 which allowed for installation of NEXCOM Segment 1a radios at Terminal sites when completed in parallel with En Route sites.  NEXCOM Segment 2 received a JRC Final Investment Decision in September 2011. NEXCOM Segment 2's program management team and contract officers will award the prime radio contract in April 2012. NEXCOM Segment 2 has dependency relationships with the FTI, DATACOMM, NVS, and NEXCOM Segment 1a investments.","NEXCOM Segment 2's new VHF and UHF radio technologies support the FAA's goal to reduce congestion and increase economic competiveness, which it does by making more efficient use of existing radio spectrum and replacing older, unrepairable radios.  The older radios (GRR/GRTs) were purchased between 1965 and 1980, and installed in the late 1960s and 1970s with a predicted life cycle of 20 years. As these radios age, the likelihood of failure increases and given the size of the installed base, this scenario can tax the National Airspace System's (NAS's) resilience. Other operational radios were installed between 1995 and 2005, with a predicted life cycle of 10 years. Currently, failed older radios are repaired with components cannibalized from out of service units. NEXCOM Segment 2 will insert the latest radio technology into the NAS. By replacing these old radios and their higher failure rates with the newer VHF and UHF radios, NEXCOM Segment 2 is reducing the future increase in O&M costs, which is a cost avoidance.  Additionally, with more planes flying during peak periods and Air Traffic Controllers becoming empowered to work more efficiently, more radio spectrum will be needed for Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications; either for more voice, data, Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) technologies or a combination of these.  If the NEXCOM Segment 2 program is not fully funded, it will not complete on time by 2027.  This will cause a continued stress on the current older radios as they become unrepairable with obsolete parts.","In December 2010, NEXCOM Segment 2 received a JRC Authorization to Proceed.  This Authorization allowed Engineering Services to start NEXCOM Segment 2 implementation. To date, over twenty Terminal facilities (RTRs and RCOs) have been completed and many others are in the planning and installations stages.  There has been a quick learning curve for Engineering Services as skilled installation crews are retained during the gradual transition from NEXCOM Segment 1a to NEXCOM Segment 2. Additionally NEXCOM Segment 2 is currently in the evaluation process of prime contract award as the program management team reviews multiple radio vender proposals that were submitted to the FAA after the FAA released the SIR. This radio contract will serve as the prime contract for the investment and is scheduled for award in September 2011. The finalized NEXCOM Segment 2 cost and schedule model will be completed and baselined in 2011 as NEXCOM Segment 2 will receive its FID in September 2011.","With the prime radio contractor selected in September 2011, the NEXCOM Segment 2 team will spend a large majority of FY2012 working with the selected radio vendor to ensure radio specifications are met and the radios work properly after they are installed. In April 2012, NEXCOM Segment 2 will complete factory acceptance testing (FAT) with the prime contractor.  Operational test & evaluation (OT&E) is currently scheduled for completion in September 2012.  Additionally, over five hundred radios (from the NEXCOM Segment 1a radio contract) will be installed at RTR and RCO Terminal sites during FY2012.

GSA also has the capability to offer additional value-added services to agencies, beyond just core financial management system functions.Our current customer base consists of GSA Services and Staff Offices and over 45 external client agencies.Our dozens of financial management client agencies are successfully using the Pegasys application as their financial management system of record.","GSA offers agencies the CGI Momentum Enterprise Solution; agencies may select to migrate to only the core, the core plus one or more additional modules, or the entire solution (includes additional functionality such as acquisitions and performance budgeting). Because potential client agencies are able to have their own instantiation of the application (same Momentum version, hosted on the Pegasys technical platform and in GSA's data center environment), there is no dependency to GSA's internal financial management system operations and existing GSA projects, but the benefits of economies of scale and skill are realized by common sharing of resources such as infrastructure. During the past year, GSA OCFO has focused on developing a strong business model and plan that positions us to provide cost-competitive, best value financial management services to a new, larger size client market. GSA is also continuing to service and market to new small client agencies. GSA is positioned to scale up to provide hosting and other FM services for a mid or large size agency. Because GSA is partnering with the private sector to provide IT hosting and support, time to &quot;scale&quot; up is minimized and significant Government capital costs outlays are avoided.","Security Contracts (C&amp;A, IV&amp;V) Billing and Accounts Receivable (BAAR) Investment OCFO Reporting Strategy (Business Objects/Data Warehouse) Pegasys Hosting Increase Pegasys Upgrade to 6.x (2 year refresh cycle).","Security Contracts (C&amp;A, IV&amp;V) Billing and Accounts Receivable (BAAR) Investment Billing and Accounts Receivable (BAAR) Refresh OCFO Reporting Strategy (Business Objects/Data Warehouse) Pegasys Upgrade to 6.x (2 year refresh cycle).",280.316,48.577,30.621,33.363,1998.0,2018.0,The summary of spending has increased from the Current Year President's budget request to this year's submission largely to the maturation of the Billing and Accounts Receivable (BAAR) Project.,N/A.,5,"The performance of this major IT investment is monitored as part of the Agency's monthly investment control review.

Advantage is a web-enabled e-commerce shopping mall that enables global users to purchase products and services with a government Purchase Card or their federal Activity Address Code (AAC).  The 2010 Advantage sales were over 660 million.  GSA Advantage offers a catalog of 31 million products and services from over 19,000 GSA and VA Schedule vendor contracts.  It is fully FAR-compliant and allows customers to select vendors to meet their socio-economic goals. GSA Advantage replaces direct contact with multiple vendors, offline use of other FAS systems, and the need for users to maintain paper copies of GSA schedule documents and catalogs. It provides users with the latest product information and prices, and reduces research time. The system also enables customers to compare product features and prices in accordance with FAR 8.4, obtain quantity discounts, review delivery options, select payment methods, place orders online, receive order confirmation via E-mail, view order history and track status, report problems, find vendor contact information, cancel orders or reorder, reconcile invoices and credit card statements, and receive customized data based on interests, purchases and visits.The system allows users to browse or search for products or services in a variety of ways, including key words, part numbers, National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and vendor names.  In addition to the basic product search capability, GSA Advantage provides customers with the ability to search for products that are environmentally friendly, energy efficient, recycled items, small business items, or items made by the National Industries for the Blind or the Federal Prison Industries. The system also allows customers to submit electronic Requests For Quotes (RFQ) for products and services offered by Advantage vendors.

It also states that GSA will  ...provide best-value service and product offerings on time.   GSA Advantage e-commerce systems close this gap by providing the means for agencies and military services to acquire needed supplies and services in order to perform their mission.

The system also provides support to the FAS Customer Supply Center System and GSA Advantage! system. In the event of national disasters like forest fires, work stoppage, and other emergencies, agencies can place emergency orders 24 hours a day for items like protective suits and respirators. Internal FSS 19 customers include FAS personnel located in the acquisition centers, depots in Region 2 (New York) and Region 9 (San Francisco), and the Office of Acquisition Operations and Electronic Commerce Center. External users (in other Federal agencies and the military, District of Columbia government, eligible State and local governments, and educational institutions receiving Federal funds) send orders to the FSS 19 system through other systems such as the Defense Automated Addressing System, Customer Supply Center, Warehouse Management System, GSA Advantage! for product information, and the Touch Tone Ordering System for the U.S. Postal Service. Over 210,000 customers use FSS 19 each year. FSS 19 is an end-to-end order processing system, performing all major phases of the order process. Automation features of FSS 19 include managing pricing and cataloging of items, receiving and storing stock, maintaining currency of items in stock and recommending stock replenishments, writing and correcting purchase orders, collecting and maintaining contract information of vendors on schedule, negotiating schedules, managing the bidding process, supply decision-making and routing of customer orders to the stock or special order programs, maintaining backorders, processing cancellations, generating all depot documentation for packing and shipping stock items, providing the status of all customer orders, billing the customer, sending billing data to the Office of Finance, retrieving data on-line, maintaining summarized information on customer demand and the history of over 10 million orders, tracking vendors, and using Workload Selection Instruction so each depot can determine how to consolidate shipments based on route, carrier and/or area. FSS 19 interfaces with the order processing systems mentioned above, and with various financial accounting systems (NEAR/Pegasys).","The following performance gaps are being addressed by FSS19, directly and in coordination with supporting systems CSC and Advantage:Improving product and service offerings so that customers can select the level of service and pricing model that best meets their needs;Enhancing the customer experience by increasing visibility, consistency and customer choice regardless of customer location or product need;Increasing the efficiency, visibility and consistency of internal operations, including managing the proper balance between stock and direct delivery inventory;Integrating more fully with DoD planning and operations while attracting civilian agency users to maintain strategic balance.There would be a negative impact to many areas of the FAS CIO if this investment isn t fully funded.

FFATA directed that a free, single, searchable website be available to the public and described the type of information which must be include with each award (e.g. unique name, award amount, description) and USASpending.gov fulfills this requirement.USASpending.gov contains data on federal obligations for contracts and first-tier subcontracts, grants, and first-tier subgrants, loans, direct payments, insurance, and other forms of financial assistance.  USASpending is closely aligned with GSA s mission to foster an effective, sustainable, and transparent government for the American people.  An individual can easily perform searches to discover how much government money has been spent in a particular state or a specific time period and could also isolate particular types of government spending, as desired.USASpending obtains data from multiple external sources (e.g.  FPDS-NG, CCR, CFDA, FSRS, DUNS) and it is dependent upon the continued operation of those systems.","This investment has closed many of the performance gaps identified in GAO s report 10-365, which was issued in March, 2010.  One of the audit findings was that OMB had no plan for collecting and reporting of subaward data.  This plan was implemented on August 27, 2010, by issuing the Open Government Directive -  Federal Spending Transparency and Subaward and Compensation Data Reporting.  The necessary changes were made to the USASpending.gov website and the required subaward data was collected and became publically-available on October 1, 2010.If this investment is not fully funded, compliance with FFATA is likely to be jeopardized and any subsequent GAO audit is likely to produce negative results.","During FY 2011, USASpending.gov was updated with many new features and functionality.

Since FPDS currently fulfills only a portion of FFATA requirements, it must first be expanded to include the remaining data segments (i.e. grants, loans, direct payments, insurance, and others financial assistance).If this expansion of FPDS can be accomplished, the partial integration of the two systems is expected to yield significant cost savings.

All EaaS offerings will be secured &amp; certified by GSA.The FCCI manages several governance groups, including the FCCI Executive Steering Committee, the FCCI EaaS Working Group, &amp; the FCCI Security Working Group. All are composed exclusively of federal employees from across government who represent the interests of their home department. Also, these groups serve as a forum for requirements sharing &amp; networking, &amp; ensure strategic focus on cloud planning &amp; implementation within the federal enterprise.FedRAMP will create a unified risk management process that increases security through focused assessments; eliminates duplication of effort &amp; facilitates associated cost savings; enables rapid acquisition by leveraging pre-authorized solutions; &amp; facilitates multi-agency use of shared systems. FedRAMP can help agencies avoid the 6-9 months and $150,000-$180,000 the average Authorization &amp; Accreditation (A&amp;A) package requires to complete.

The FCCI helps agencies improve access to modern technology needs faster and with lower costs, allowing agencies to pay only for the resources they use in response to high and low demand, avoid the expenses of building and maintaining an IT infrastructure, and control the appropriate level of security for data and applications. Also, cloud computing is a key technology for achieving &amp; enabling cost effective data center consolidation, an area identified as a key federal priority.Furthermore, the average IT acquisition takes months or years, and can cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to complete. With the FCCI's pre-competed acqusition solutions, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) capabilities can be rapidly acquired, provisioned, and implemented, allowing agencies to quickly support mission-critical programs and activities.

023-999990230,23,General Services Administration,30,General Activities,"IAE is the largest and most complex of the initiatives promoted by the E-Gov Act of 2002 that calls for electronic procurement initiatives. The IAE mission is to standardize, integrate, and streamline the Federal procurement processes, through electronic means, for the acquisition workforce and business partners, while increasing transparency. The vision is to provide the environment where the power of Federal procurement standandards is realized. IAE strategic goals are to: A) Integrate Business Processes; B) Enhance Data Quality, Data Sharing, and Transparency; C) Provide Secure Technology Platforms; D) Maximize the Benefit; and E) Empower Efficient Acquisition.IAE optimizes resources to deliver services. Examples include capabilities for:- Vendors, grantees, and loan recipients to register to do business with the government (Central Contractor Registration and Dun and Bradstreet services)- Vendors to find government opportunities (FedBizOpps)- Vendors to report subawards (eSRS/FSRS)- Agencies to report contract actions (Federal Procurement Data System)- Contracting officials to check on past performance, if a party has been excluded from doing business with the Federal Government, and check vendor s certifications and representations (Past Performance Information Retrieval System, Excluded Parties List System, and Online Representations and Certifications Application)As a result of these efforts, IAE simplifies, unifies and streamlines the acquisition process for buyers as well as for vendors and sellers.  This is done through the essential core of shared services which has freed up agencies to focus on Agency-specific needs while leveraging these government-wide shared services.Currently, IAE's 2010 Strategy Plan efforts are focused on delivery of service centric, open architecture, aggregation of applications to provide more full-service and integrated capability for both the acquisition community and vendors.  Accomplishments expected by the end of the BY include System for Award Management (SAM) 1st and 2nd Migrations develop awards, completions, and Go Live; Common Hosting Services (CHS) hosting for the SAM Migrations; and FSD helpdesk services for the SAM Migrations.  IAE has a strong and vibrant governance structure.  The Acquisition Committee for E-Government (ACE), a subcommittee of the Chief Acquisition Officer's Council (CAOC) , conducts monthly reviews of the IAE program, sets priorities, and approves funding.","The Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) facilitates and supports cost-effective acquisition of goods and services by agencies. The IAE provides common acquisition functions and shared services that benefit all agencies, such as the maintenance of information about business-partner organizations (e.g., banking, certifications, business types, capabilities, performance). IAE provides benefits to the government and business-partner organizations by improving cross-agency coordination that helps to improve the government s buying power, while providing business partners maximum visibility and transparency into the process. IAE provides various services, tools and capabilities that are leveraged by the acquisition communities  buyers and sellers to conduct business across the Federal Government space.The IAE has offered a portfolio of nine acquisition services which facilitates all phases of the Federal acquisition lifecycle for buyers, sellers, and the public   bringing transparency and visibility to the process of Federal acquisition. These services evolved from the  Adopt, Adapt, Acquire  strategy. In FY 2008, due to the need to meet new challenges, a fourth strategy was added  aggregate.   The  aggregation  strategy focuses on both business services and data in the acquisition lifecycle. The functions performed by the current IAE applications will be migrated to a set of acquisition business services that will be implemented consistent with Service-Oriented Architecture concepts and technology, and will leverage open source software and open source software development methodologies. Aggregating and leveraging a set of common services such as reporting and database management will greatly simplify the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. Managing a few databases, as opposed to the current nine, will reduce data redundancy, contribute toward establishing a more secure platform, improve data integrity and reduce the cost of ownership and operation.If not funded, each Federal Agency would have to create their own systems to mirror IAE systems. In addition to cost for new agency systems, this would lead to duplication of efforts, lack of standardization, and data quality issues.","In FY11, IAE:-  Proceeded on its aggressive goal of a May 2012 launch of the System for Award Management (SAM) Phase 1 (CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS). Phase 1 requirements were finalized, development solicitation released, contractor selected, and meetings/outreach to prepare the user community conducted.  -  Initiated requirements gathering for SAM Phase 2 (FBO, CFDA, eSRS, and FSRS).-  Implemented the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) allowing prime grantees to input awards to first tier subs-grantees and forward the information to USAspending for display to the Public.-  Modified the Federal Awardee Performance &amp; Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requiring contracting officers to report terminations for default, terminations for cause, and defective pricing determinations.-  Maintained operations and support of the nine IAE systems. This included version releases, data reloads, and extended helpdesk services for the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS).","For CY12, IAE plans include:-  Continuing on its aggressive aggregation strategy with a May 2012 launch of the System for Award Management (SAM) Phase 1 (CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS). Phase 1 development and user testing will be completed, meetings and outreach will increase to prepare the user community for the new operational environment, training will be conducted, the actual GO Live launch, and operations and support. -  Completing development for SAM Phase 2 (FBO, CFDA, eSRS, and FSRS).

024-000005064,24,Department of Homeland Security,58,Customs and Border Protection,"CBP is responsible for securing the nations borders against illegal entry of people and goods while managing legitimate travel and trade. To support this mission, CBP operates and maintains one of the largest Land Mobile Radio (LMR) tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal government. Tactical communications capabilities are essential to coordinating mission activities and protecting the safety of over 44,000 CBP law enforcement agents and officers. These agents and officers operate in remote areas where their radio is often their only communications channel to coordinate activities or summon assistance.  However, much of the LMR equipment currently in use has surpassed its expected service life, does not provide sufficient coverage in remote locations, and is not compliant with current mandates concerning narrowbanding and encryption.  CBPs Tactical Communications Modernization (TACCOM) program began as a nationwide effort to implement digital Project 25, Advanced Encryption Standard narrowband systems with improved coverage and capacity.  It currently has active projects in the Tucson, Yuma, Houlton, El Paso, and Rio Grande Valley Sectors. ''''At the outset of the project, there were no options for providing wireless communications in the remote areas of CBP operations other than government-owned LMR.  However, recent developments in LTE technologies as well as efforts within Congress and the Administration to fund a nationwide broadband public safety network have opened new broadband wireless network options. This approach has several potential advantages, including broadband data and video capabilities in addition to narrowband voice; alleviation of spectrum shortages in the VHF band, and potential to provide and enterprise DHS wide solution. CBP received an ADE1 decision in 2011 to pursue this approach, called TACCOM2, and to establish it as a Department-wide project.  TACCOM has thus been rescoped from a nationwide modernization and expansion of CBP systems to TACCOM1 - the completion of projects already underway, capped by a digital-in-place (DIP) upgrade or replacement of any remaining analog equipment.  This Exhibit 300 will focus on the contracts, milestones, and performance standards for TACCOM1, while indicating that future year funding may be redirected to TACCOM2.   A separate DHS-level Exhibit 300 for TACCOM2 will be created in the in FY14 cycle''.","TACCOM1 provides direct support to DHS Mission #2, Securing and Managing our Borders.  By improving coverage, capacity, reliability, and encryption, the modernization effort provides critical communications support to the agents and officers who secure the nation's borders.   If the program is not fully funded, CBP will likely have to prioritize the completion of ongoing modernization projects in Houlton, El Paso, and Rio Grande Valley, and delay deployment of the digital-in-place (DIP) project (the Tucson and Yuma modernization projects are in IOC).   This would delay several operational and policy requirements, as indicated below: Uniform Technology Platform.  CBP requires a uniform technology platform.  LMR systems in use in CBP cover a variety of technology platforms.  Bringing the enterprise to a common digital platform will simplify and improve operations, training, interoperability between sectors, and systems sustainment, as well as allowing for a Radio Over IP (ROIP) platform that will pave the way for interoperability solutions along and across the borders.  Reliability and Availability.  CBP requires high reliability and availability of LMR systems.  Existing analog hardware has been in service since the late eighties and is failing at an increasing rate resulting in more downtime. Cannibalization of equipment is the only option for maintaining this antiquated hardware and supplies are dwindling. The failure rate is roughly 6 to 1 when compared to newer equipment.   AES Protection.  DHS Management Directive 4300A, Sensitive Systems Handbook, requires AES encryption for Sensitive Systems.  The DES Encryption used on analog system degrades coverage by up to 35%, so that agents are often forced to operate in the clear.   Narrowband Compliance.  CBP has failed to meet the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) narrowbanding deadlines for Federal land mobile radio systems.  The new deadline is FY2013. If CBP remains out of compliance, it will experience interoperability problems with partner agencies who have met the deadline.Improved Interoperability.  The 9/11 Commission Report cited failures in public safety communications, particularly in interoperable communications between responders, as a significant issue in the 9/11 response.  TACCOM1 addresses the first step for improving interoperability by bringing the full CBP LMR baseline to a P25 standard.","CBP made a significant number of key accomplishments in FY11.  In Rio Grande Valley, TACCOM completed project kickoff, Project Documentation, and Critical Design Review milestones.  In Arizona, TACCOM completed Operational Readiness Review and transition to sustainment of 72 sites, supporting appproximately 7,000 subscriber units.

TACCOM has focused Earned Value requirements on high-risk contracts (e.g., the cost plus contract awarded for El Paso).  For the Firm Fixed Price contracts (which constitute 62% of the planned or awarded dollars), TACCOM uses methods other than earned value to manage vendors and assess progress. TACCOM has added more experienced COTR resources to its staff.  In addition, TACCOM egular status meetings with all vendors, and vendors attend the monthly Project Management Reviews with the Assistant Commissioner OIT.  All invoices from these contracts are vetted through a review process that ensures the government is satisfied that the deliverables were complete, correct, and accepted.   Using this data and project schedules, project managers are able to report on cost and schedule performance, and do track SPI.  Furthermore, three of the FFP contracts consist almost entirely of commercial-off-the-shelf equipment procurement, so EVM would not necessarily help in contract management.Finally, EVM has not been a requirement of project management office support contracts.  These contracts provide level-of-effort support to the TACCOM PMO, and are not structured along billable milestones.

SEVIS also maintains information on the schools, sponsor organizations, and their appointed representatives.  SEVIS supports the DHS Mission by enforcing and administering our immigration laws and the related goals to strengthen and effectively administer the immigration system and prevent unlawful immigration.  The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) within the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the business sponsor that funds SEVIS. SEVIS also supports the Department of State (DoS) Office of Private Sector Exchange in its mission.  The ICE Office of the Chief Information Officer's (OCIO) System Development Division (SDD) SEVP IT Systems Branch provides IT program/project management support and coordinates access to other OCIO support to SEVP.  The SEVIS modernization effort will replace the current SEVIS with SEVIS II.  SEVIS II will fully address current SEVP needs and close SEVIS vulnerabilities identified by the Homeland Security Council Policy Coordinating Committee.  SEVIS II enhancements will close a range of identified process, performance, functional and technical gaps that cannot be closed under the constraints of the current SEVIS architecture.  SEVIS II enhancements will help in guarding against terrorism and protecting the United States and its citizens from harm.  The approach will aggregate multiple SEVIS records that can exist for a nonimmigrant under a single SEVIS II account tied to biometrics and a unique immigration identification number (IIN).  The creation of the account and coordination across DHS is a key dependency for SEVIS II.  ICE is collaborating with the Screening Coordination Office (SCO), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), and other government agencies.  The beneficiaries of SEVIS include government users at DHS, ICE, CBP, CIS, and Federal law enforcement.  Public beneficiaries include the schools, sponsors and F/M/J non-immigrants and their dependents.  SEVIS depends on interfaces with systems across DHS, DoS, and DoJ to accomplish its mission.  SEVIS modernization is fully funded by fees that are collected by SEVP from the schools, sponsors, and non-immigrants.","If the SEVIS investment is not funded national security will be adversely affected by limiting the ability to track and monitor foreign students, exchange visitors, and their dependents that are granted entry to the United States.

Ownership of both DM-Framework and DM-OPEN 2.0 has been transitioned from the Disaster Management (DM) Program to the FEMA National Continuity Programs (NCP) Integrated Public Alerts and Warning System (IPAWS).  These systems are no longer in scope for the DM Program.  FEMA has developed a public web strategy that focuses on achieving greater cost efficiencies, improving ease of access to key disaster preparedness and assistance information for the American public, and instituting an agency wide, web-centric culture for information sharing and collaboration.  The focus of the Web Strategic Plan is to ensure the information that is relevant to disaster survivors, the general public and the emergency management community is organized and presented in a manner that engages and improves the overall user experience.  Adopting a new, up-to-date content management system (CMS), consolidating websites, centralizing operational and maintenance costs, and standardizing the way information is presented are key goals of the plan.  The end result is to make the public web presence for FEMA a primary medium for information exchange in a manner that is cost effective, easier for all to use and maintain, and which has a much greater range of capabilities, including Web 2.0 functionality, all of which will help instill an internal web-centric culture within the programs across the agency.  There are no dependencies between this investment and other investments within FEMA, however the technology refresh and updating will be available to all DHS components.","FEMA's public web presence has been challenged by a lack of a consistent, uniform, and consolidated approach to providing information via the Internet. Information is spread out over more than 50 identified sites hosted at 14 different locations using a multitude of content management systems that are not integrated and have usability issues that prevent widespread adoption throughout the FEMA web-based community. If the technology updates being worked by the DM Program are not completed, the cost of maintaining this scattered web approach to the public will continue to be in the tens of millions of dollars due to multiple sites, inconsistent and outdated data due to a lack of oversight, and absence of shared standards for branding/presentation, and the effective central control mechanism for the dissemination and mgmt of the info.  The current FEMA sites are using a content management systems multiple generations old, are very limited proprietary systems developed by third parties, which severely inhibit sharing of information across platforms, and which have very little functional capability. The Teamsite content management system utilized by the main FEMA.gov website, and shared by DHS.gov, TSA.gov, Citizens Corps, USFA and other agency sites, was installed in 2004 and has been struggling to maintain currency through an endless series of quick fix upgrades that do little to increase overall functionality. The current CMS is undergoing a technology refresh in  FY11/12 to address these issues, and will be adopted across all DHS components.  Benefits of the technology refresh include content management publishing and authoring for FEMA and DHS components with with decreased costs, publishing and approval oversight, defined workflows, and less impact to FEMA infrastructure. This technology refreshment is overdue for FEMA and is required so that FEMA can continue to meet their mission in a cost effective and efficient manner, utilizing current technology. Fewer resources will be required to maintain the CMS, it will be utilized across all DHS components, will reduce costs, provide more flexibility than legacy system, and will provide more mobility and availability of access to information for the public.","An AoA was completed to identify alternatives for the CMS refresh.  The CMS will operate in the cloud and will not touch the DHS/FEMA infrastructure.  IPT meetings are held weekly with DHS and FEMA program offices to ensure open communication regarding the CMS refresh.  A services SOW has been completed and approved.

024-000005625,24,Department of Homeland Security,45,Transportation Security Administration,"The USA PATRIOT Act prohibits states from issuing to any individual a license to transport hazardous materials in commerce without determination as to whether the person is a security risk. The Act requires that checks be conducted against criminal history, immigration, & international databases. TSA Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) meets this mandate by conducting a security threat assessment (STA) on drivers applying to obtain, renew, or transfer a hazardous materials endorsement (HME) on state-issued Commercial Driver's License. Prior to the inception of the investment, the driver endorsement process for transporting hazardous materials focused on the states driver safety record to reduce the risk of a Hazmat incident.  However, a security gap remained, because a drivers safety record does not adequately identify persons who would do harm by transporting hazardous materials with the intended purpose of terrorists acts.  This investment addresses the specific level of risk posed, and supports the mission of preventing terrorism and enhancing security to the homeland.  HTAP leverages existing criminal history, legal status & intelligence data to perform a STA on commercial truck drivers who transport hazardous materials to determine the threat status to transportation security.  The STA is dependent upon the efficacy of the information contained in intelligence, criminal and legal status data bases. STAs utilize national data sources and consistent vetting standards which are universally applied to applicants seeking a HME.  ''''The HTAP is an important and key component of the DHS/TSA layered management approach to transportation security in its mission to protect our nation from dangerous people. This investment supports DHS strategic goals and business objectives of awareness, prevention, protection, response, service and organizational excellence. Primary beneficiaries of this investment are citizens of the homeland through identifying persons of risk who could do harm and prohibiting those persons of risk from holding a hazardous materials endorsement.  Commercial trucking industry and carriers are derived beneficiaries.","The USA PATRIOT Act prohibits a state from issuing a license to transport hazardous materials in commerce unless a determination has been made that the individual does not pose a security risk. TSA's investment for Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) meets this statutory mandate and conducts a security threat assessment (STA) for those that seeks to apply for, renew or transfer a hazardous materials endorsement on a state-issued Commercial Drivers License (CDL). HTAP is an important and key component of the TSA layered approach to transportation security in its mission to protect our nation from dangerous people.  Prior to the inception of the investment, the transport of hazardous materials required states to perform checks of HME applicants to reduce the risk of a Hazmat incident.  State licensing agencies checked applicants' state backgrounds for driving infractions, illegal drug usage, and criminal history for specific offenses such as driving while impaired.  The state licensing agencies did not check national criminal, intelligence and immigration sources as required by the USA PATRIOT Act, nor were the states collecting fingerprints in order to access national databases.  In addition, there were no universally applied methods for determining if a once valid HME holder was still eligible for the privileges originally granted.   The establishment of this national program as required by the USA PATRIOT Act continues to close this gap and address the weaknesses in state licensing issuance procedures. Threat assessments are more thorough using reliable national data sources, more consistent standards using HTAP criteria to assess risk, and universally applied to drivers from all states and D.C.  HTAP reduces the performance gap in increased efficiency, leveraging existing intelligence data, to perform threat assessments on commercial truck drivers who transport hazardous materials to determine threat status to transportation security.   In creating and utilizing consistent standards, HTAP improves information sharing and data integrity with other Federal and state agencies so that timely decisions and reliable information better serve the public and enhance security. TSA's addresses continuing HME eligibility as derogatory datasets are updated and modified, offering real time responses to emerging threats and intelligence information.   HTAP is a fee based program and receives no direct appropriations.","Prior to the implementation of TIM and this investments migration, the existing HME system will be sustained to meet operational and business requirements. Accomplishments in the  prior year included sustainment to support completion of all security threat assessments. HTAP continued to meet its mission, accomplishing  O & M sustainment and completed over 230,000 threat assessments  in 2010.  In FY2011, HTAP has completed over 220, 000 as of July 1, 2011  ."," TSA has established comparability standards and identified comparable Security Threat Assessments (STAs) to reduce the burden on individuals that are required to have multiple STAs because of the nature of their work. For example, individuals who have had successful background checks for purposes of the U.S. Coast Guard Merchant Mariner Credential, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Free and Secure Trade (FAST) card, or state commercial drivers license hazardous materials endorsements (HMEs) are entitled to a reduced fee when applying for a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC).  Similarly, this investment has a planned accomplishment for the CY to implement HME/TWIC comparability which will allow the program to leverage previously completed TWIC security threat assessments for applicants applying for an HME,  This accomplishment shares the goal of Congress and stakeholders that programs be harmonized to alleviate the burden and inconvenience placed on individuals by the need to obtain multiple STAs, to the extent legally possible.This planned accomplishment will address the changes necessary to implement comparability across the HME/TWIC background checks and provide ease of use for the individual transportation worker.  The planned accomplishment supports the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, P.L. 110-53 (9/11 Act) signed into law on August 3, 2007.  As part of the 9/11 Act (H.R. 1 - 210 Section 1556),  Section 5103a of 49 U.S.C. was amended to state that individuals who had a valid Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) required by Section 70105 of title 46, U.S.C. shall be deemed to have satisfied the background check required for the HME.  TSA is working to satisfy the requirements of the 9/11 Act by implementing comparability between the HME and TWIC programs for HME applicants via changes and updates to the existing programs' systems and processes.

024-000005605,24,Department of Homeland Security,45,Transportation Security Administration,"Secure Flight (SF) enhances the security of domestic and international commercial air travel through the use of watch list matching. SF strengthens security by operating a threat-based, watch list matching capability to identify potential matches. SFs primary beneficiary is the traveling public. Ensuring the security and privacy of those individuals is a priority, as evidenced by the following program goals: 1) Identify known and suspected terrorists who appear on the No Fly or Selectee Lists and attempt to board a domestic or international flight or gain access to the sterile area within a domestic airport; 2) Prevent individuals on the No Fly List from boarding an aircraft and subject individuals on the Selectee List to enhanced screening to determine if they are permitted to board an aircraft; and 3) Ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce while protecting privacy. ''''By collecting specific passenger data, SF can conduct effective watch list matching while facilitating the travel experience for passengers, including those who have been misidentified in the past. SF provides earlier insight into potential matches to the watch lists, an interactive capability for recurring watch list matching, and integrates the DHS redress results into the watch list matching process to help prevent future delays for misidentified passengers. SF has relieved airlines of the responsibility for conducting their own passenger watch list matching, ensuring a consistent approach to identifying potential matches. ''Passenger information screening under SF is ultimately more timely and accurate than the information previously used in airline matching efforts. This further ensures that potential terrorists are not provided clearance to board a scheduled passenger aircraft or enter the sterile area of an airport.  SF provides earlier insight into potential matches to the watch list prior to departure. This enables SF to clear (for boarding pass) 99% of prescheduled passengers prior to airport arrival. ''''The SF system interfaces with airlines primarily through the DHS Router, a single portal through which airlines transmit passenger data to multiple DHS agencies. This One DHS Solution minimizes the burden on airlines of needing to submit unique sets of passenger data to the various agencies depending on their respective requirements; the DHS Router accepts the full submittal of passenger data from each airline and disseminates data elements to agencies accordingly.","TSA created the Secure Flight program in response to the 9/11 Commission recommendation and the intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act that requires TSA to assume watch list matching responsibilities from the airlines. As of November 23, 2010, Secure Flight conducts watch list matching for all covered aircraft operators with flights into, out of, and within the U.S., as well as for covered U.S. aircraft operator flights between two international points. Effective April 11, 2011, in addition to the No Fly and Selectee Lists, Secure Flight conducts watch list matching against the Expanded Selectee List which contains all TSDB records with full name and full date of birth, but not included on No Fly or Selectee Lists. Secure Flight notifies aircraft operators via automated message of passengers who are confirmed matches to the Expanded Selectee List and should be designated for enhanced screening. This addresses a screening gap identified after the attempted attack on December 25, 2009. Secure Flight is capable of randomly selecting a percentage of passengers for additional screening to build unpredictability into the matching process. Secure Flight is also capable of identifying passengers for enhanced screening using information derived from threat-based intelligence scenarios run by CBP's Automated Targeting System. Secure Flight enhances overall watch list matching by providing earlier detection (as much as 72 hours) of individuals who may pose a threat to aviation or national security. Secure Flight also reduces name mismatching. TSA has established a performance measure for a system false positive rate of not more than .06 percent. The false positive rate has consistently remained below .005 percent. Secure Flight also incorporates an integrated redress process for individuals with similar identities to those on the No Fly, Selectee, and Expanded Selectee Lists. Passengers who apply for redress via DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) and who TSA determines are not individuals on the No Fly, Selectee, and Expanded Selectee Lists are added to a Cleared List. Secure Flight matches all passengers against this Cleared List, reducing future misidentifications. If the Secure Flight program is not fully funded, the ability to meet its mission will be severely and negatively impacted. Full funding ensures that the human resources, technology, and flexibility to meet stringent requirements is adequately maintained.","During FY 2011, Secure Flight was deployed for all covered U.S. aircraft operators and foreign air carriers flying into, out of, and within the United States - completing a 9/11 Commission recommendation a month ahead of schedule. Secure Flight improved air carrier compliance regarding the submission of full passenger data by implementing the functionality to reject incomplete submissions. Secure Flight enhanced its watch list matching capabilities by incorporating additional subsets of the Terrorist Screening Database and improving the Operations Center review process. Secure Flight also improved its reporting capabilities with the launch of the Reporting Management Sub-System (RMS).By the completion of FY 2011, Secure Flight will launch the Known Traveler Proof of Concept, which will allow low-risk passengers to receive an improved checkpoint screening experience. In addition, Secure Flight will begin screening against new populations, such as private charter operators.","For FY 2012, Secure Flight will continue development of the Secure Flight system to ensure efficient, accurate, and reliable watch list matching. This will include system enhancements to improve the ingestion, automation, and reconciliation of watch list records through the DHS Watchlist Service. Secure Flight also plans to expand the Known Traveler Proof of Concept to additional airports and air carriers, enabling Secure Flight to more effectively deploy its resources against high-risk passengers, while facilitating the travel of low-risk passengers. Secure Flight will continue its population expansion by screening against covered flights that pass over the continental United States. For FY 2013, Secure Flight will focus on optimizing system capabilities and identifying opportunities to apply risk-based principles to passenger screening. This will include the enhancement of the tools utilized by the Secure Flight Operations Center to improve efficiencies. Similarly, Secure Flight will continue to improve its reporting capabilities, providing expanded metrics to key stakeholders. These approaches will continue to promote increased efficiency, while facilitating air travel and enhancing passenger security.",408.265,84.194,92.414,107.074,2001.0,2021.0,There are no changes to the FY 2012 CIP at this time.,"As Secure Flight is in O&M, EVM is not required.

024-000005624,24,Department of Homeland Security,45,Transportation Security Administration,"STIP is an agency-wide data management system that provides a centralized focal point connecting passenger and baggage screening security technologies to one network, addressing current data, threat response and equipment challenges. STIP assists managers in effectively administering Technology Security Equipment (TSE), deploying personnel and adapting to changing security needs. The priorities of DHS and TSA guide STIPs direction, and its three strategic goals to increase performance of key activities: (1) Enables the automatic collection, standardization, analysis and dissemination of critical asset and personnel performance data, improving TSAs situational awareness and risk-based decision making processes; (2) Remotely manage TSE threat detection capabilities, enhancing TSAs ability to respond to new and emerging threats; and (3) Enables TSA to remotely monitor, diagnose, troubleshoot and manage TSEs, allowing TSA to address equipment issues, prevent failures and reduce the need for on-site visits. STIP will leverage and be fully integrated into TSA's Operating Platform (TOP), which is TSA's existing computing infrastructure.  By integrating with TOP, STIP will be able to utilize the existing operations and maintenance environment that is currently employed for TSA systems.  STIP will be expanded to enhance its interface with existing DHS and TSA systems, including Sunflower, Performance Indicator Management System (PIMS), Performance Management Information System (PMIS), and Regal, which will allow them to share information more efficiently than the currently existing manual processes.  STIP will allow all systems to remotely capture and transmit data in real time, providing on-the-fly capability for assessing risk, determining performance, and conveying accurate and timely information. The program has a wide variety of stakeholders who are the primary beneficiaries, including Airport personnel, TSA leadership, the Passenger Screening Program (PSP) and the Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP). As the technology component of PSP and EBSP, STIP will seek to meet the information collection, retrieval, and dissemination requirements of both programs, as well as address potential areas of improvements within operations and maintenance for airport security equipment. STIP enablement is dependent on the readiness of the screening technologies and availability of network infrastructure provided by the TSA Office of Information Technology.","STIP was initiated to meet a need to automate the gathering and analysis of data to assess security technology equipment performance.  The aviation security environment encompasses more than 18,000 pieces of security equipment deployed to nearly 450 airports nationwide.  Currently, these pieces of security equipment are not networked to a single hub for centralized management and monitoring, which limits TSA's ability to develop a holistic view of airport security operations.  The security environment has limited information sharing and analysis and impedes TSA's ability to adapt technology to dynamic threats.  STIP offers that hub in the form of an Enterprise Manager  that provides a central location for the storage and analysis of officer and equipment performance data such as Threat Image Projection (TIP) scores and baggage throughput.  STIP will address capability gaps in effectively managing Transportation Security Equipment (TSE) and enabling more effective mitigation of threats through: enhanced security, improved data management, information sharing and enterprise management, configuration management, resource management, and remote monitoring and maintenance.  STIP supports several of the TSA/DHS strategic goals including:  Enhanced Security/Protect Infrastructure - STIP enhances TSA's threat management capabilities through increased situational awareness and control of TSE performance and operations in addition to improving response times to new threats through automated and remote updates to TSE; Improve Resource Management/Strengthen our Nation's preparedness and Emergency Response - STIP enables the automatic collection of operational and screener performance data from TSE, improving the timeliness and accuracy of this information.  Ready availability and increased accuracy of the data will enable TSA to perform the analysis necessary to make data driven decisions regarding the allocation of equipment and personnel; Decrease Operational Costs/Strengthen and Unify DHS Operations and Management - STIP provides the capability to proactively address equipment issues and prevent failures and increase equipment uptime and availability.  If the investment is not fully funded, TSA will not be able to improve decision making through automated data collection, realize cost savings from advanced remote monitoring and maintenance procedures, nor have the ability to increase detection capabilities for screening technologies through remote updates.","In BY11, STIP continued the development of additional functionality for the enterprise applications and the development/upgrades of STIP solutions for the security equipment.  Development of the Maintenance Ticketing Application, updated TIP functionality, and upgrades of the Itemizer 2 ETD equipment have been completed.  The completed Maintenance Ticketing Application will enable TSA to synchronize maintenance tickets with the  maintenance service provider and enable the automatic generation of tickets when errors on fielded equipment occur. The updated TIP functionality will allow automatic updates of training image libraries on Advanced Technology X-Ray units and enhanced reporting which will give TSA leadership better insights into screener performance. STIP has also begun the upgrade 500DT ETD units in parallel with PSP of this technology. This approach reduces rework and saves costs of having technicians perform STIP upgrades as a separate effort.","In BY12, STIP will be developing solutions for additional Explosive Trace Detection (ETD), X-Ray, and Explosive Detection System (EDS) technologies and deploying the upgrades to fielded equipment.  This effort will involve coordination with EBSP and PSP to issue STIP development contracts for additional screening technologies which both programs are in the process of procuring. The program will be conducting an operational assessment of the Remote Monitoring and Maintenance (RMM) functionality using operational screening equipment at three different airports. The 180 day operational assessment will assess the effectiveness of STIP RMM functionality in an operational setting, using functioning equipment at actual airports. Once the assessment is completed, the STIP System Evaluation Team, which operates independently of the program, will evaluate the results and produce a Systems Evaluation Report. This report will be submitted to DHS which will generate a Letter of Assessment used to inform the DHS ARB ADE3 which would ultimately grant STIP the approval for full deployment of the Remote Monitoring and Maintenance functionality.  Additionally, it is anticipated by the end of BY13, Trace, X-Ray, and EDS technologies will be upgraded and connected to STIP.  Integration of maintenance ticketing and performance management systems by  BY13 will establish efficiencies in reporting and monitoring of operational readiness across the agency.",81.45,16.601,16.585,15.572,2005.0,2020.0,The funding levels have not changed.,"All TSA acquisition programs in Development, Modernization and Enhancement (DME) phase, in accordance with TSA MD 300.8, will apply EVM to cost or incentive contracts which exceed twenty million dollars ($20M).  In the case of STIP, deploying EVM does not make practical sense, due to no contracts falling into the categories mandated by TSA MD 300.8.  The resources required to administer and report on EVM related data will negate the benefits of the Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts the program utilizes, and no contracts exceed or come close to $20M in value.  When applicable, STIP will seek to utilize EVM on tasking related to deployment activities in accordance with DHS Earned Value Management Guidance (Nov. 06), TSA Management Directive MD 300.11 and OMB Circular A-11.  STIP will utilize compensating controls, such as weekly vendor calls, to collect and analyze cost, schedule, and performance information from contractors.  STIP will also create mitigation strategies to ensure that the project stays on schedule and deliverables are tested and accepted. Although EVM is not conducted STIP has a schedule to track major program tasks and milestones.  This information has been included in the Cost and Schedule Milestone Table.  Furthermore, the STIP Team has conducted an operational analysis to assess the current STIP Operational Activities.  This analysis addressed cost, contract performance and schedule related to operational tasks.",4,"STIP establishes a common data reporting system that works reliably and securely on multiple vendor operating system platforms.  It collects and standardizes unique TSE data in near-real time.  Because STIP enablement is managed on a TSE model-specific basis, the duration of each test event is highly dependent on the OEM's ability to meet development and test milestones.  As a result, schedule planning for TSE enablement must take into account a number of internal and external constraints and dependencies.  The STIP team has completed the site surveys at the nation's airports and, in working with TSA Office of Information Technology, has developed a comprehensive plan for deployment that addresses infrastructure gaps identified by the survey.  This approach allows for connectivity of machines where infrastructure exists, while planning and implementing fixes to locations where connectivity is not present.  As evidenced in the accomplishments since the last review, the program is streamlining processes to become more efficient.  STIP continues to be a well run program that provides long-term benefits.

The SAFE Port Act of 2006 further specified requirements regarding program timelines and conducting an extensive pilot to evaluate TWIC reader performance and impacts on maritime business operations.  The program began issuing credentials in October 2007.  By the national compliance date of April 15, 2009 the program had issued over 1 million credentials.  As of July 2011 more than 1.9 million workers applied for a TWIC.  The TWIC population includes longshoremen, truckers, port employees, and others who need access to maritime facilities.  In addition all U.S. Coast Guard documented and licensed mariners require a TWIC.''''The TWIC program is entirely funded through the fees paid by applicants. The benefit of the TWIC program is that it will improve security by establishing a system-wide common secure biometric credential that can be used by operators of the nations maritime  transportation system to make access control decisions.  The TWIC card technology and procedures for issuing the credential align with the Federal standards for issuing Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials to government employees and contractors.  This allows the TWIC to be recognized as a secure credential and to be interoperable with PIV readers including PIV biometric readers.  The TWIC program established standards and processes for enrollment, card activation and issuance, STA adjudication including a robust appeal and waiver process, and card revocation,  The beneficiaries of this  investment are:  facility employees; longshoremen; U.S. mariners; long-haul and drayage truck drivers; and, other individuals requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels.  ''''Starting in BY12 the program will be reliant on TTACs Universal Enrollment Services (UES) contract for all TWIC enrollments.  Over time the UES contract is expected to expand the number of enrollment centers capable of service the TWIC population by approximately 50%.  Also, starting in BY14 the program will be reliant on the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) program for Identity Management System (IDMS) services.","Prior to this investment ports and maritime facility operators could not determine which individuals accessing secure areas of their facilities might present a security risk.  Furthermore, there was no common, secure credential that could be relied on nation-wide to verify these individual's identity.  If this investment did not exist or was not fully funded it would increase our security risk back to the pre 9/11 state. This would inherently introduce secure risk at national ports and provide opportunities for those with hostile intent to access key transportation nods.   This investment now provides a common credential which is mandatory to be used by port and facility operators verify the identity of workers eligible for unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA 2002 regulated facilities.  Without the TWIC and full funding to ensure the production of TWIC Cards to transportation workers there would not be a way for maritime facility operators to determine if individuals would pose a threat to their facilities.","2011 - 350k workers enrolled this year Enrollment centers open and operational 99% of the timesConcluded card reader pilot at 5 major ports Maintained comprehensive stakeholder outreach program to port facilities operators, worker unions, biometric industry  Completed card end of life card stock change over from 72k chip to a 144k chip.","2012 Continue to advance the TWIC Reader rule in coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard.

TWIC is in the O&M phase where EV is less critical.  Nevertheless, there are a number of measurements that are currently gathered and monitored at various critical points during the processes of enrolling, performing STAs, card printing, and card activation.  These measurements help the Program Management Office monitor performance of the entire TWIC operation.  What follows is a description of the metrics that are being collected by the program.  A summary of program performance is found in the Cost and Schedule section.   Lockheed Martin (LM) performs all enrollment and system Operations and Maintenance tasks.  Weekly, LM reports its performance, including the number of Enrollment Centers opened, the number of enrollments and activations completed by each Enrollment Center, TWIC applicants' wait time at the Centers, help desk wait times, how long it takes to enroll the applicants, and the percentage of fingerprints that were rejected by the system. Other metrics are gathered and monitored weekly by the organization performing STAs, including the number of cases that await adjudication, the number that are pending additional information, the number at various other stages of the adjudication process, and the total number of cases that are cleared to be issued TWIC cards.   At the USCIS card printing facility, the two primary metrics collected are the number of cards in the queue awaiting printing, and the number of cards printed.  Once the cards have been sent back to the Enrollment Centers, the program keeps track of the number of cards that are ready to be picked up by enrollees and the number of cards that have been finally issued.    In accordance with a DHS regulation, the TWIC population must all be issued TWIC cards by April 15, 2009. In order to manage the flow of workers applying for TWIC cards without taxing system capacity, a compliance schedule has been established mandating when each Enrollment Center must comply with the regulation at various deadlines prior to April 15.  Thus, the program tracks weekly  the number of enrollments and activations at each Enrollment Center in relation to planned enrollments and activations.",4,"The Transportation Security Agency (TSA) Transportation Workers Identification Credential (TWIC) program continues to successfully provide outstanding support for issuing and utilizing this critical credentialing. Enrollments are approximately 25,000 per month which generates the steady stream of fee income.  The TWIC program is working closely and effectively with the Terrorist Threat Assessment and Credentialing ((TTAC) Infrastructure Modernization (TIM)) program to ensure program needs will be met going forward.  TSA is pursuing a rulemaking for a Universal Fee Rule that will provide necessary flexibility for TSA to provide common screening, vetting, and IT support capabilities to the universe of programs supported by TTAC.  Implementation of the Universal Fee Rule will help mitigate any funding issues the TWIC program might otherwise face as a stand-alone fee-funded program.  This success is a direct result of the management skill and ability shown by the TWIC program management office.

Currently, over 90,000 key stakeholders benefit from TOP including: TSA Headquarters, National and International Airports, Federal Air Marshall Service, Transportation Threat Assessment & Credentialing, Federal Security Directors, Field Offices, Transportation Security offices and industry (KSMS, IACMS, STAT, VISAT). Applications residing in TOP easily disseminate information and data across TSA, resulting in improved execution of mission critical responsiveness and operations to constituents and stakeholders as matters of National Security arise. The capabilities of TOP provide the following performance characteristics and tangible benefits: Common functionality across constituent user groups, increasing communication and collaboration; High level re-use for IT component, reducing investment costs; A simplified IT environment, creating consolidated operations and maintenance support at lower costs; Shared enterprise data/content repositories, for easier, faster dissemination of critical data; Centralized security and role-based access, enabling stronger IT security efforts against potential threats; Elimination of redundant application and data stovepipes, reducing investment costs; and a single face  to citizens, increasing communication during National Security issues. The TOP program is compliant with the DHS Enterprise Architecture, is sufficiently robust and scalable to directly support other DHS components, while also serving as a model for other federal, state and local agencies. TSA upgraded this investment during the past 36 months to a highly virtualized and multi-tenant environment when the entire infrastructure migrated to DC1/2, resulting in enhanced server uptime and technology infrastructure, operations, and maintenance cost reductions. The TOP effort is dependent on the continued operations of the TSA IT Infrastructure Program to provide the core infrastructure which enables TOP to operate. Conversely, several other TSA investments rely on the continued success of TOP, such as Air Cargo, PMIS, and STIP primarily due to the fact that TOP provides the environment that these programs use to maintain their support operations. Therefore, without proper funding these programs may not have an environment to operate within and TSA employees would not have Network capability to sustain the day-to-day mission.","The TOP investment provides the backbone for all automated voice and data communications at TSA which helps close the mission critical gap to deliver an automated information network. To support an automated information network TOP also maintains all programmatic software and core mission applications, such as PARIS, the No-Fly List, and Alerts and Notifications. TOP enables a streamlined provisioning process to acquire secure and reliable information and software IT applications that have helped and will continue to help TSA meet legislative mandates and deliver integrated database and network resources. Through delivering a centralized Platform, TOP also reduces IT lifecycle costs resulting from a patchwork or piecemeal approach to systems development. TOP provides TSA the capability to coordinate cyber security threats and limits the unsustainable cost growth of IT Operations and Maintenance (O&M) through increased system transparency. TOP supports several core TSA functions.  Therefore, not fully funding this effort would result in the inability to deliver application functionality for mission-support solutions or develop new applications as a result of ever-changing security threats across land, sea and air.  The ability of TSA to quickly identify threats and develop solutions to mitigate those threats is essential for continued success and minimizing terrorization of the general traveling public.","TOP delivered Secure Flight Release (SF) 3.3.1 to implement changes required to support mission, improve UI Manual Review and Resolution processes, and implement Playbook changes. TOP also led the Correspondence Control Mgmt System (CCMS) Dataloader Release 1.1, for the Office of Special Counselor (OSC) so they can respond to incoming correspondence requests from public and/or Government agencies. Correspondence Control Mgmt System (CCMS) will provide OSC with the capability to track and manage correspondence (between 8,000-9,000 packages annually).  Additionally, the Claims Mgmt System (CMS) Release 2.1.4 is a public-facing site that allows claimants to search for the status of a pending claim or find status of their claim through a Claim Number and either Home City or Zip Code.

With the events of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard identified the need to modernize its numerous and often disparate logistics processes to a more unified mission support organization model.  After much study, the Aviation Model of logistics support was selected as the best example of sound business processes to support a unified support structure to more effectively provide mission support.  ALMIS had evolved within the Aviation model and was the ready resource in the DHS and USCG Enterprise Systems Inventory to be the core technology by which all districts, sectors, and asset types are now transformed (i.e. modernized).  To date, ALMIS has over 18,000 registered users and processes approximately 500,000 transactions per day.  It is operated under a fully functional, four-tier life cycle management process, and all releases are versioned and recorded according to Coast Guard standards.  In addition to the ongoing support of USCG Aviation, ALMIS has accomplished the induction of small boat forces at all of Coast Guard districts. AMMIS, a subsystem of ALMIS, recently achieved United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliancy giving AMMIS a modernized accounting system compliant with USSGL uniform chart of accounts.

024-000006064,24,Department of Homeland Security,60,United States Coast Guard,"The Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) System is a fully deployed information technology investment that is in an operations and maintenance status. It continues to be effective in meeting its intended purpose and supporting new initiatives. Continued funding for operating support and making enhancements is necessary to meet continuing Coast Guard missions as well as evolving Homeland Security missions and new legislative requirements. For example, recent port and vessel security enhancements have been made to support the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and Security and Accountability for Every Port (SAFE Port) Act. MISLE is a mission essential application that directly supports Coast Guard missions rated under the PART Program, including: Drug Interdiction, Fisheries Enforcement, Marine Safety, Marine Environmental Protection (MEP), Migrant Interdiction, Port, Waterway and Coastal Security (PWCS), and Search and Rescue (SAR). MISLE collects, stores and disseminates data on vessels, cargoes facilities, waterways and parties (both individuals and organizations) as well Coast Guard activities involving all of these entities. MISLE Activities include, law enforcement boardings, vessel sightings, marine inspections, marine safety investigations, response actions, search and rescue operations, operational controls, and enforcement actions. MISLE is an integrated system that manages the flow information from the initial triggering event, to incident management and response, and the resulting follow-on actions. It improves efficiency by reducing manual processing of information capture and communication. MISLE shares data with other systems to facilitate maritime domain awareness, data analysis, and program management. The data captured in MISLE is used to measure progress towards strategic goals. MISLE includes two citizen centric components. The Vessel Documentation System (VDS) allows the public to order Abstracts of Title via the internet. The Coast Guard Maritime Information Exchange (CGMIX) is collection of self-service internet web sites that provide information directly to the public on USCG approved equipment, incident investigations, MARPOL reception facilities and Coast Guard vessel actions. MISLE continues to be the most appropriate solution to meet Coast Guard operational requirements. No other system exists that can as effectively support and integrate the data required by the diverse CG operational missions.","The Marine Information for Safety & Law Enforcement (MISLE) system replaced the Marine Safety Information System (MSIS), Law Enforcement Information System (LEIS) and Search and Rescue Management Information System (SARMIS).  MSIS was built in the early 1980's and provided support to the Marine Safety Program.  LEIS supported law enforcement missions in a separate database and SARMIS supported Search and Rescue missions in another database.  Due to hardware and software that was technologically obsolete and expensive to maintain, these systems were at high risk of failure and were not fully supporting Coast Guard marine safety and law enforcement mission needs.  Gaps addressed by MISLE include:- Created a single database for all Coast Guard Marine Safety and Law Enforcement missions.  In MISLE, those missions share common vessel, party, facility, waterway and unit tables to create a unified view of mission activities.  This in turn facilitated information sharing. - Created the Vessel Indentification System (VIS) as required by law (PL 100-710).  None of the systems replaced by MISLE could have accomodated VIS. - Improved the user interface and better aligned the information system with Coast Guard business processes.- Eliminated redundant data entry.- Created a mobile computing capability not available in the systems replaced by MISLE. - Enhanced system reliability and availability. - Consolidated system management and created efficiencies that reduced overall operation and maintenance cost. - Created a geographic display of MISLE data. - Added data analysis capability, including measurement and oversight information that was not previously available. The MISLE acquisition project was completed in 2003.  If Operations and Maintenance is not fully funded, the system cannot be patched and maintained to meet security and operational requirements.  System reliability will decrease and Coast Guard personnel will not have the information needed to perform and manage their mission activities.  For example, without historical information in MISLE to use in targeting activities, Coast Guard personnel will be less effective in accomplishing their marine safety, security and law enforcement missions.  There are also certain documents that can only be created through MISLE, such as Certificates of Documentation and Certificates of Inspection.  The inability to issue these documents would adversely impact maritime commerce.","FY 2011 (PY) Accomplishments - Improved system availability to users and reduced data errors. Continued funding for operating support and making enhancements is necessary to meet continuing current Coast Guard missions and new legislative requirements.

024-000006117,24,Department of Homeland Security,60,United States Coast Guard,"As stated in the Maritime Port Operations Handbook (Jan. 2009), the objectives of IOCs are to:  a) Maintain a common situational awareness picture of the maritime domain. b) Provide enhanced information sharing between port partners. c) Foster planning and coordination efforts with local DHS and other Federal, State, and local partners on a regular schedule through designated points of contact. d) Coordinate local asset operations to improve mission performance, eliminate redundancy in mission execution and avoid mission conflicts. e) Conduct risk assessment and analysis, resulting in risk management of operations. IOC is the vehicle for acquiring the information systems, facilities, and sensor networks necessary to deliver three new capabilities that form the IOC Process which facilitates the coordination of all IOC missions: Integrated Vessel Targeting (IVT); Interagency Operational Planning (IOP); and Operations Monitoring (OM).''''Segment 1 will field an IOC information system, currently titled WatchKeeper, as a technology demonstrator with incremental fielding of capabilities to locations prioritized by the Sponsor.  Evaluation of the pilot effort will occur prior to internal CG approval for full operational implementation.

Overall, these gaps illustrate a lack of: a) basic awareness of vessel activities near vulnerable port and coastal infrastructure. b) Systems linking the ever-increasing volume of information with vessels in ways that help decision makers determine threat and develop the correct course of action. c) Infrastructure for effective information sharing and joint operations with port partners.   IOC is designed to enhance unity of effort among maritime stakeholders: * IVT: Integrates targeting results of agency-specific screening processes and builds a consolidated threat picture of people, vessels and cargo operating within IOC OPAREA as provided by intelligence and law enforcement communities in support of the Ports, Waterways and Coastal Security mission.  This includes:  * AIS Services  * Data Services * Interagency Operations Planning: Integrates federal, state, and local asset status and schedules.  Mission Requests are created from IVT results, along with other mission demand sources, such as regattas, patrols, and escort missions. These Mission Requests are prioritized by IOC decision makers, who assign assets to missions and form the IOC Daily schedule. * Operations Monitoring:  Manages the IOC Daily Schedule against all emergent events - search and rescue, spills, and other events occurring outside the operational planning window.  Creates and shares the tactical picture, including command and control, mission status, and status of IOC forces/Blue Force Tracks. These capabilities support the interagency operations process described in the DHS IOC CONOPS and reflect the best practices outlined in the DHS Maritime Port Operations Handbook.    WatchKeeper will take advantage of existing enterprise IT components, evolving products, initiatives, COTS, and pilot projects with demonstrated capabilities. The products chosen support three core areas of the architecture: Information Presentation & Interface Layer; Information Discovery and Understanding Layer; Information Sharing, Processing and Consolidation Layer.  Because IOC is not fully funded, the program is not able to develop existing or new sensor integration.  Existing radar overlays and video monitoring, for example, will not be integrated resulting in reduced situational awareness and reduced information sharing for USCG and port partners.","Accomplishments for FY2011 include: a) Release of WatchKeeper software as a Technology Demonstrator to key target sites : Detroit, San Diego, Puget Sound, New York, Long Island Sound, Boston, Miami, Key West, and Guam.b) Completion of a WatchKeeper Operational Assessment/Analysis. c) The Integrated Logistics Support Plan (ILSP) v1.0 approved 11/16/2010d) An independent Logistics Assessment completed 2/08/2011e) Signed ORD and ABP were submitted to DHS for review In addition, IOC successfully completed the following DHS Investment Reviews:a) Project Level ARB review (11/2010)b) Project Level ADM Review (12/2010)c) Segment 2 ADE 2B (03/2011)d) Segment 2 System Definition Review (SDR) (02/2011)e) Segment 2 Preliminary Design Review (PDR) (04/2011) The following Segment 2 test activities have been completed:a) TMOT Charteredb) TEMP v2.0 at DHS for approvalc) DT&E Plan draftedd) Operational Test Authority (COMOPTEVFOR) in place.","The WatchKeeper Technology Demonstrator will be deployed to the following sites: San Juan, New Orleans, San Francisco, Honolulu, Ohio Valley, LA/LB.

It is the intent that all contracts, where required, will include the requisite EVM clauses and the government will review EVM data on at least a monthly basis. EVM will be performed and reported in compliance with ANSI guidance using a variety of tools, policies, and procedures. These data will be mapped against specific performance measures and requirements and included in the quarterly DHS periodic reporting and USCG quarterly PMA reporting. Performance measures will also shared within USCG and across DHS and DoD so that lessons learned across the organizational investments are leveraged. Once systems are deployed, operational analysis including contract reviews in the context of the performance goals is performed for the IOC investment in conformance with OMB and DHS Operational Analysis Guidance.   O&M contracts may include EVM clauses; use of EVM will be determined closer to O&M contract initiation.               For those contracts that do not require EVM because they are either FFP or are below USCG established EVM reporting thresholds, the IOC project team reviews monthly status reports to verify that work accomplished is consistent work reported in the status report.  Regardless of contract type, size or duration, the CG IOC PM meets regularly with the contractual PMs to verify that work is being met within contractually established cost, schedule, and performance metrics.     In addition to external contractors, IOC leverages other 'in house' offices such as C3CEN, OSC, etc. to provide services to the IOC project.  These intra-agency agreement Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) include specific cost, schedule, and performance metrics similar to IOC contracts with external entities.  The IOC PM meets regularly with the USCG assigned PMs to verify that metrics are being met.     In both instances (external contractors and intra-agency entities) if metrics are not being met, remediation plans are formulated and implemented. Regular reviews of the IOC risk matrix assists to identify potential issues before they occur and implement remediation plans in a proactive manner.",4,"While Congress has earmarked money for the Interagency Operations Centers program to develop and deploy, it has not provided any Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding.

CGBI supported 6.2 million user access hits from all areas of the Coast Guard in FY2011.CGBI is accessed by over 77,000 employees, contractors and Auxiliary members.","CGBI as the enterprise Business Intelligence system closes the gap in the mission delivery and management support areas not otherwise available by providing analysis capabilities and performance reporting capabilities not found in our transactional, source data systems. The unique capabilities of CGBI allows leadership, managers and personnel to assess, validate and correct effort, activities and resource use daily if needed, to ensure operations are effective and efficient. Performance metrics are maintained in CGBI to measure performance against established standards. CGBI utilizes data from over forty authoritative systems and is used to monitor core mission, business support and mission support lines of business. Insufficient funding would also severely impact established management and performance reporting processes across the Coast Guard in the Prevention and Response areas, as CGBI has been integrated into processes across all lines of business in the Coast Guard. Failure to fully fund the CGBI project would have severe support and operational repercussions as offices supporting 16 of the 20 functional areas of the USCG Business Reference Model directly utilize CGBI capabilities. All Operational areas also directly or indirectly utilize the system for reporting and analysis. Failure to fully fund CGBI would cause severe degradation in the Coast Guard's ability to effectively carry out many support operations, planning and corrective actions or to manage resources effectively. Insufficient funding would further lead to the creation or implementation of redundant, costly, inefficient and stove-piped Business Intelligence systems to fill the gap.","New functionality inlcudes the build your own Scorecard tool based on the USCG strategic direction and the Balanced Scorecard Methodology. Users are able to build a customized Scorecard using hundreds of standard measures arranged in six perspectives; Mission Outcomes, Processes, Resources, Workforce, Leadership and  Customer. Each Scorecard has built-in data visualizations and links allowing further graphing of the data and linkage to other relevant content within the CGBI system. The Scorecard may be created, modified, saved and then shared via HTML links. Each time the scorecard is opened it is refreshed with data from CGBI's Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). At the time of this submission, there are over 549 unique Scorecards built and in active use across the Coast Guard utilizing this functionality. This has reduced the number of non-standard measurement tools in use, leading to greater efficiency, uniformity of data, and  higher user satisfaction.","CY and BY planned accomplishments include the addition of a Dashboarding capability tied to Strategic Initiatives and existing measures in the CGBI system, minor revisions to the build your own Scorecard tool, Revision of the Enterprise View and Executive Tabs on the main CGBI screen with new measures and data visualizations, automating the CGBI self-audit for disused products and reports, mapping all measures to the FEA BRM, Revising the Organizational Chart Viewer (based on approved unit structure), Data Quality Reporting (measures and reports), automation of CGBI training through increased use of computer-based training (CBTs) and tracking, and Mobile applications. This listing does not include O&M issues such as software patches, server upgrades, etc., but those projects passed to the CCB and approved as having value to specific USCG programs, lines of business, units, or the entire USCG as providing improvement to specific outcomes and improving operational efficiency through actionable reporting and BI feedback. Operational efficiency is directly improved via CGBI products such as the Operational Planning Assessment Report (OPAR) as part of the Standard Planning Direction (SPD). In brief, the SPD provides general guidance from HQ to the field on how to deploy/operationalize assets to meet the coming FY12 needs. The OPAR provides the operational reporting needed back up the chain of command to answer as to how well we are meeting those goals and to make necessary adjustments. As adjustments are made (such as more boat SAR hours in District 5, less cutter LMR hours in District 1) the relevant metrics and targets in CGBI are updated to reflect the ongoing assessments of performance influencing effectiveness and efficiency ini the CGBI products.",50.365,6.288,6.308,6.328,2006.0,2017.0,N/A.,"EVM is required under the contract.

024-000006079,24,Department of Homeland Security,60,United States Coast Guard,"Rescue 21 (R21) is the U.S. Coast Guards (CG) advanced command, control, and communications system for missions in the coastal zone. R21 was developed to better locate mariners in distress and save lives and property at sea and on navigable rivers. This system is replacing the legacy National Distress and Response System in use since the 1970s. R21 system components include radio transceivers, towers for antennas, operator consoles, data servers, and interconnecting networks. Commanders and watch-standers benefit from the capabilities that R21 provides in helping to ensure the successful outcome of Search and Rescue missions. These capabilities include: Advanced Direction Finding (DF) which more accurately identifies the location of callers with lines of bearing to the VHF radio transmission source which reduces response time and search area; Continuous, enhanced VHF-FM marine radio coverage out to 20 nautical miles from shore; The ability to indentify suspected hoax calls, eliminating unnecessary response actions and conserving resources; Increasing the number of voice channels from 1 to 5, and protected (secure) communications for homeland security missions;  Digital voice recording with immediate playback, which improves the ability to review and resolve garbled or unclear transmissions; Timely flow of information between the CG and other government and law enforcement agencies, and communications with mariners; and providing Digital Selective Calling  (DSC) capability to meet the international Global Maritime Distress and Safety System requirements for Sea Area 1. With increased communications coverage, advanced DF and DSC capabilities, R21 significantly enhances the CGs ability to detect and respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. publics marine safety and save lives. To date, R21 has been used in more than 30,000 SAR cases. In FY2012, the R21 Production Contractor System Design will be deployed to the 32 Sectors/Groups under contract with the production contractor providing a total of 41,871 miles of costal coverage, encompassing the continental United States, Great Lakes, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  In the Western Rivers Sectors the system will have begun low rate initial production at select sites in the first of three Sectors. In Alaska, initial design work on a new console and DSC system will continue. Completion of R21 is not dependent upon other projects.","The Rescue 21 Project eliminates many existing communication coverage gaps (dead zones) while ensuring continuous, enhanced VHF-FM marine radio coverage out to 20 nautical miles from shore within the coastal zone.  The system provides digital voice recording capability with immediate playback to resolve unclear transmissions, which is a critical function to support search and rescue planning and response asset management.  The system also provides improved direction finding capability for more timely response to mariners in distress and an ability to distinguish hoax calls from actual distress calls, which helps avoid unnecessary costs and risks to response crews and assets.  The system provides additional voice communications channels to allow watchstanders to conduct multiple operations including protected (secure) communications for homeland security missions.  The system enhances Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) by maintaining communications with mariners and facilitating the timely flow of information between the Coast Guard and other government and law enforcement agencies.  Finally, the system provides Digital Selective Calling (DSC) capability to meet the international Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) requirements for Sea Area 1 per the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) treaty.Failure to fully fund the Rescue 21 Project will impact the Coast Guard's ability to fully execute its missions in the Alaska region.  The continuous VHF-FM marine radio and DSC capabilities are critical to the timely receipt of mariner's distress calls and deployment and direction of response assets.  Legacy VHF-FM communications capabilities are near the end of their service life and must be recapitalized, and the addition of DSC is required for SOLAS treaty compliance.","The Rescue 21 (R21) program has acceptance milestones which mark accomplishments achieved by the project. The Conditional Acceptance (CA) milestone signifies beneficial use and completion of the deployment of the R21 system in a Sector. R21 has already CA two Sectors in FY2012: Lake Michigan  01Dec 2011 and San Juan  31Jan 2012. In FY2012, CA will occur in 2 remaining Sectors:  Honolulu 02Apr2012 and Guam 28Jun2012, adding Rescue 21 coverage to a total of 3,190 miles of U.S. coastline amongst the 4 Sectors. Final Acceptance (FA) occurs when removal of the legacy system has been completed and the R21 system is completely transition to the System Support & Maintenance organization. In FY2012 R21 will complete FA in 15 Sectors. For both the Western Rivers (WR) and Alaska (AK) projects Systems Engineering Life Cycle documentation was prepared, system specifications were updated to meet Sponsor requirements, and deployment planning for the respective systems was conducted.","By the end of FY2012, the Rescue 21 system will be fully deployed in 32 Sectors, providing a total of 41,871 miles of costal coverage.

The CG performs several broad missions, which include maintaining a system of Aids to Navigation, conducting Defense Operations, Maritime Law Enforcement, Marine Inspection, Port Safety, Search and Rescue, Marine Science, Ice Operations, and Environmental Response. Primary mission of CG Logistics Program: provide logistics support which encompasses all of the activities associated with developing, acquiring, testing and sustaining all assets to ensure safe and effective use throughout their lifecycle. Vessel logistics supports over 240 cutters and over 1000 standard boats.  FLS provides an integrated logistics system for configuration management, financial and procurement management, supply support, maintenance and supply data. CMPlus feeds configuration, maintenance and supply data to FLS. FLS uses the data from CMPlus for decision-making to support logistics. FLS provides NESSS with historical and future supply data via the maintenance information captured in CMPlus and FLS. NESSS provides supply data for use by FLS. NESSS supports all supply activities needed for the naval and electronics program. NESSS supports the financial management system for the Coast Guard Yard. FLS feeds CMPlus with new updated configuration, maintenance and supply data. CMPlus and FLS via ARMS enables field units to create and send MILSTRIP requisition transactions and generate obligation accounting data. VLS is steady state and is currently in the Control Phase of CPIC. Software Change Requests to the system will only be approved and performed if they are required to keep the system in operational/steady state mode and to support the logistics transformation.  Per ALCOAST 620/05 the Coast Guard is transforming/aligning our business processes for logistics.  Logistics will use a single set of business processes modeled after the Aviation BPM. Resources not aligned will be refocused and redirected to support the logistics transformation. VLS will be replaced by the new Single Logistics Information Management System in a phased approach.","This investment closes the performance gaps identified in the mid-90s by continuing to provide a suite of tools supporting the Coast Guard's surface logistics community.  The youngest application in the VLS suite moved to Produce/Deploy/Support stage in 2000.  There are existing performance gaps not met by VLS.   Some of these will be met when CMPlus is tech-refreshed in 2012.  Most gaps will exist until VLS is replaced by CG-LIMS.  The impact of not funding support for the existing VLS suite would be a scaled erosion of logistics services provided to, and to some extent, managed by the operational Coast Guard fleet, proportional to the reduction in funding.  Specifically, there would be losses in the ability of the surface community to perform configuration management, financial and procurement management, supply support, and maintenance documentation. Further, historical and future supply data that drives logistics decisions would not be available, hindering logistics decision-making and leading to less efficient logistics support.  ICP inventory tracking capability for surface assets would be lost.",NESSS incorporated the ability to provide an additional layer of transaction processing for ICP-to-Remote Stock Point and Remote Stock Point-to-Asset to allow for Total Asset Visibility (TAV). The change is referred to as Mobile Unit Support (MUS). MUS also provides the ability to replenish parts at the Sector level based on usage and need.  Developed the ability to directly send requisitions from FLS to NESSS for items that are managed by the SFLC streamlining the requisition process.,"The first phase of the CMPlus tech refresh project is expected to be deployable first quarter FY13.. This will include new capabilities in FLS to support CMplus. 1) Inventory Management - provide inventory management for shore side units that currently utilize CMplus for this functionality. 2) Shore Side Support - the ability for cutters to request shore side assistance from their respective product line who will manage and coordinate the appropriate service providers through FLS ensuring the best method and provider is engaged.. These projects will allow CMplus to become the tool to be used on mobile units only as it will be developed with limited connectivity in mind. All other units will utilize the FLS or NESSS proper. The tech refresh will change the development environment for CMPlus. This, in turn, will support a modular deployment of additional functionality in BY13. This functionality is enumerated in (10).

These documents provide evidence of their immigration status, eligibility to live in or enter the U.S., and as authorization to work in the U.S. These documents are mission critical to Department of Homeland Security (DHS). IDP Division is a leader in the production of secure identity cards using optical memory card technology with embedded biometrics. IDP Division manages a card personalization process that unites seamless, continuous, automated and integrated card personalization technology to produce highly secure DHS issued cards. The current system is a steady state system that reflects a mixed level investment and that provides USCIS with the capabilities to personalize cards foreigners and others need to document their legal status and to demonstrate that they are eligible for a wide range of immigration and other benefits. Over 47 million cards have been produced since the program became operational in FY98. Documents currently produced by IDP include the following: the Permanent Resident Card (PRC), Form I-551, (Green Card), the Employment Authorization Document (EAD), Form I-766, Travel Document Booklets including the Re-entry Permit, (Form I-327) and the Refugee Travel Document Form I-571, and the TSA Transportation Worker Identification Credential card. Card production services are acquired by USCIS through the effective use of a publicprivate partnership where IDP provides management oversight and a private sector contractor provides the necessary resources to deliver card and travel document production services. IDP investment supports the USCIS priorities of eliminating backlogs, improving customer service, enhancing national security and increasing productivity and efficiency. Specifically, IDP allows is required to :produce quality, tamper-resistant, machine-readable, biometrically enabled documents using the latest state-of-the art printing and identity management technologies; enable the U.S. to keep ahead of the threat of document counterfeiting, fraud and tampering by periodically upgrading and enhancing the security features of our documents; foster electronic verification by creating documents with security features and technological media capable of being verified electronically. See No. 30/ Overview for more info.","As part of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) statutory mission, USCIS produces a variety of secure identification documents used to provide evidence of eligibility for immigration benefits to its customers. The IDP is responsible for USCIS' secure identity document production operations. USCIS' statutory mission to produce cards is described in the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) (at 8 USC 1304(d), codified at section 264) which requires that every alien who has been granted lawful permanent residence status be issued a certificate of alien registration or an alien registration receipt card in such form and manner and at such times as shall be prescribed under the regulations issued by the Attorney General. Federal courts have held that this provision imposes upon DHS a nondiscretionary duty to issue such documentation in a timely manner.  As such, document production management has been a critical component of the USCIS mission because timely evidence of benefits is statutorily mandated. If IDP is not fully funded the USCIS  will not meet its mission.","Major FY 2011 accomplishments included:-  December, 2010 launch of the capability to send initial mailings of Permanent Resident Cards (PRCs) and Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) using Secure Mail Initiative (SMI) protocols; -  Launch of an EAD that is travel-enabled. The SMI replaced the practice of mailing secure documents with first class mail with a new system that allows USCIS and its customers to track secure identity documents by telephone and internet.  Gaps closed by this include enhanced security and accountability, speedier delivery times and improved customer service;- February 2011, USCIS began issuing employment and travel authorization on a single card for certain applicants filing an Application to Register Permanent   Residence or Adjust Status.

USCIS ELIS implements customer and case management, workflow management, document and knowledge management, risk and fraud and rules engines, and identity management systems to process benefits applications received by USCIS.  To implement this system, USCIS is reengineering business processes for all USCIS lines of business; implementing change management and training for more than 10,000 employees; implementing or upgrading the hardware and software infrastructure for multiple environments, and upgrading the technology in USCIS field offices. Transforming the Agency will help USCIS meet its customer service, national security and operational excellence goals by closing many gaps in current business processes associated with paper files, forms and evidence. It will also address typical customer and advocate complaints such as a lack of consistent, complete and accurate answers; frequent and duplicative requests for evidence; lost or misplaced files; and limited transparency. After the transformation, customers will be able to manage and save their information and evidence in online accounts, access case status and will have multiple options for communicating with USCIS. Third-party filers can also establish online accounts to file and manage their customers cases. Adjudicators will receive complete, decision-ready cases, rather than checking multiple legacy systems and managing paper files. New tools will identify potential fraud and route riskier cases to subject matter experts for rigorous review. USCIS managers can conduct quality checks, monitor and report detailed performance more readily; respond to workload fluctuations more efficiently and effectively, and improve transparency and accountability. Transforming USCIS will also enhance information sharing among the Agencys Federal partners, ultimately strengthening the immigration system and national security. The transformed system will be deployed incrementally to cover USCIS lines of business: Nonimmigrant for customers, adjudicators and third-party filers in Releases A and B; Immigrant in Release C; Humanitarian in Release D; and Citizenship in Release E.  This investment incurs O&M only after Release A1 is deployed in FY12 (See Summary of Funding.) O&M incurred up through FY 2011 is for digitization costs only and is not for O&M of USCIS ELIS.","Without the implementation of USCIS ELIS, the current form-centric, paper-based business processes will continue to be non-standard across field offices; decisions will be made in a non-standard way, which leads to inconsistency and impacts customer service.  Files that may contain unique evidence provided by an applicant may be lost, leading to much frustration on the part of the applicant and also on the part of USCIS employees. USCIS will not be able to streamline processing of benefit applications; both in terms of improving efficiency and avoiding delays in processing applications.  USCIS ELIS, enables USCIS to better improve security of the process and to further enhance information sharing with other government agencies. Without USCIS ELIS, USCIS will continue to spend valuable time on performing manual tasks that could be automated.  Without USCIS ELIS, USCIS will continue to experience typical customer and advocate complaints such as a lack of consistent, complete, and accurate responses to inquiries; frequent and duplicative requests for evidence; lost or misplaced files; and limited transparency.  Without USCIS ELIS, USCIS Adjudicators will continue to receive incomplete information and have to follow an inefficient process in order to render decisions. Without USCIS ELIS' e-filing capability, the volume of manual scanning of benefit requests sent to the lockbox will not be reduced.  Paper files will still need to be mailed around the country resulting in storage costs and creating the possibility for lost or misplaced applications.  Without USCIS ELIS, information sharing among the Agency's Federal partners will continue to be hampered by inconsistent data and lack of real time availability. Without USCIS ELIS, the costs and risks inherent in the legacy systems will remain. USCIS will have to continue to support very expensive enhancements for these systems, such as CLAIMS 3 and Central Index System for which there are very few skilled programmers, and which the latest security and monitoring systems cannot support. USCIS ELIS is a requirement to enable USCIS to be in compliance with security mandates.  Without this investment, USCIS will not be able to further enhance business processes and realize efficiencies as envisioned by the component.","USCIS identified all requirements to deliver end-to-end functionality for Release A (Nonimmigrant benefits); developed and demonstrated an end-to-end electronic immigration processing prototype which was used to complete detailed design and development of three of four iterations of the core account and case management functions to support the intake and adjudication of the I-539,  including account management, workload management, document management, Web-enabled account and identity management, while keeping stakeholders updated on progress, and gathering their feedback."," In FY 2012, the Office of Transformation Coordination (OTC) will: Deliver Release A1 and A2 (Phase 1) of Transformation to implement Account and Case Management, customer and case management, workflow management, document and knowledge management, risk and fraud and rules engines, and identity management systems to process benefits applications received by USCIS.

The DHS CIOs vision to fortify this foundation is embodied in the Infrastructure Transformation Program. It is through ITPs execution that collaboration barriers within and across DHS Components are reduced and operations are more efficient. ITP represents an enterprise-wide transition toward developing, implementing, and managing cross organizational efforts. Recent accomplishments include: a)Network Services: Further consolidation of network capability by deploying full functionality of OneNet, through the completion of the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) infrastructure at DC2, and the transition of  the configured TIC at DC1 and DC2. Significant strides were made in migrating each of the Components network sites to the central network management at the NOC. b)Data Center Consolidation: Accomplished further migration activities and implementation of power upgrade projects at DC1. Currently, DC1 hosts 65 systems, an increase of 55% over the previous year. DC2 accomplishments include: migration of TSAs legacy Hazelwood DC, HSDN migration , transition of FEMASs Intelligent Road/Rail information Server and migration S&Ts Field Network Phases 1& 2 (6 additional servers installed.) c)Email. Major milestones include a common email technology, with a common address list for quick and easy access to contact information. Plus, a complete build out of an Active Directory architecture to which adopted Components align. d)Wireless: This domain continues to support the Components and spectrum requests for Federal Protection Details; emergency response to tropical storms and disasters; and border initiatives such as ground based radar assignments. Progress made since the genesis of ITP has benefited critical infrastructure, cyber security, and disaster recovery gaps noted in FY05-07 GAO and DHS Inspector General Reports. The uniform network services, consolidated computing asset footprint, standardized email platform and wireless capabilities provided by ITP will continue to reduce system maintenance, management and administration costs. Going forward, for FY 11 and 12, ITP priorities include: Enabling Department TIC, continuous support of Component transition and data center migration to the Data Centers; and increased focus into Component disaster recovery capabilities.","The Infrastructure Transformation Program (ITP) is a group of interrelated initiatives designed to improve the Department's Information Technology (IT) infrastructure by unifying disparate Component information technology networks, platforms and services into a set of enterprise wide IT Services.  ITP will provide robust, reliable, scalable, secure, survivable, and cost effective infrastructure to support DHS mission and business-critical systems and applications. ITP provides the foundation for DHS's Information Sharing Environment (ISE).  ITP fulfills the DHS vision of  One Infrastructure-One DHS.1)  One Net  creates a secure, survivable enterprise network with centralized operations (NOC), security (SOC) and governance. 2) E-Mail - Establishes a common, reliable and standardized email communication system to facilitate information sharing across the Department; provides a single enterprise Global Address List 3)Data Center - Consolidates 43 primary Component Data Centers into 2 physically secure, geographically diverse Enterprise Data Centers (EDCs).

DCD supports the consolidation of legacy data center environments to two enterprise-wide DHS Data Centers by funding essential infrastructure, capability enhancements, disaster recovery and support services to meet current and anticipated data service requirements. This includes essential power upgrades and other investments required to enable DC1 and DC2 to reach full capacity and meet service level objectives.","This investment is predominantly in the O&M phase and are thus not required to use EVM.  DHS does not intend to use EVM on Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Time and Materials (T&M), and service contracts because it may not be a cost-effective way to measure the performance of the contractor. Of the contracts outlined above, 5 are FFP, T&M, service contracts, and/or contracts that solely support O&M functions not requiring EVM. There are an additional 19 contracts involving interagency agreements or small awards (<$5M) for which EVM is also not intended. Notably in the table, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), Creative Computing Solutions, Inc (CCSi), and Electronic Data Systems LLC (EDS), contracts would normally require EVM due their total contract values respectively. The application of EVM on T&M efforts however is optional (at the discretion of the program manager) under DHS guidelines. EVM, in this instance, is only applied to Logical Follow-On (LFO) task orders associated with these contracts. ESD primarily uses Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with financial incentives and disincentives based on agreed-upon performance standards.  These standards have been defined at various levels to manage contractor performance; and cascaded from enterprise level requirements to each Component's mission-centric subscribed service needs. Contract layering from this perspective has yielded compliance with enterprise level targets, better information sharing across Components, and efficient deployment of critical technical support when needed. Contracts under this Investment are also subject to a rigorous Quality Assurance Surveillance process and routine Contract Technical Review as supplementary mechanisms to mitigate the Government's risk while employing T&M contract vehicles. Negative results from these reviews are not only documented and further addressed in accordance with the Risk and Issues Management approach outlined in the Appendix of this Exhibit, but may also expose the contractor to financial penalty outlined in the SLAs.The ITP's acquisition approach has been successful thus far in aggregating a picture of performance necessary to ensure consistency with the Program's objectives.

The ISS LoB investment will improve the level of cyber security across all government agencies, reduce costs by consolidating certain security products and services into centralized Shared Service Centers (SSCs), and improve security decision-making through an agency-neutral governance structure.  Currently, the ISSLOB conducts the following in the four Activity Areas: 1) Security Training; currently overseeing activities of 4 security awareness training SSCs. 2) FISMA Reporting; Currently overseeing activities of 2 FISMA reporting SSCs.  3) Situational Awareness and Incident Response; SAIR Tier I BPA awarded in 2009, resulting in $85M cost savings to date ($78M in FY11).

Currently overseeing activities of 6 C&A SSCs.","If the ISSLOB were not funded, then the program could not sponsor Shared Service Centers (SSCs) or Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) for cybersecurity tools and services. Although agencies can procure these tools and services independently, they cannot achieve the same benefits that are currently available because of the ISSLOB's government-wide scope. The ISSLOB fills gaps for agencies by increasing cost avoidance, standardizing security, and strengthening security posture across government.

Gd.If the SSCs are not operational, agencies cannot use offerings such as C&A services and security awareness training (SAT). Successful security programs require these tools/services, and if agencies cannot take advantage of the SSC offerings, they will be required to purchase vendor tools/services at higher prices. This dependency on private sector offerings will mean a loss of cost savings for potential SSC customers. The SSCs submit regular metrics and their offerings must meet ISSLOB standards, so if they are not operational, then agencies will have to use tools and services of varying quality. A lack of standardization of these tools/services results in weaker government-wide security posture.If the ISSLOB cannot sponsor GWACs for cybersecurity tools and services, agencies will have to undergo lengthy procurements to purchase similar offerings at higher prices. Agencies will lose time and money that they could have saved if they had access to ISSLOB-sponsored GWACs. To date, these GWACs have resulted in $85M in cost avoidance that would have been unachievable were the ISSLOB not funded. As with SSC offerings, the use of ISSLOB-sponsored GWACs allows agencies to implement tools/services that meet ISSLOB standards, creating security standardization that is not possible without the ISSLOB.

As TTAC continues with its infrastructure modernization effort through FY2014, CVP systems will provide a reliable and consistent vetting infrastructure to TSA and other components of the federal government such as the FAA while TTAC plans for a smooth transition to the modernized platform to be implemented for FY2014.","The Crew Vetting Program supports the mission of identifying potential threats to aviation security from air crews that fly into, out of or over the United States.  To date, the CVP infrastructure has provided 24/7 name-based vetting capabilities to all transportation sectors regulated by TSA including port workers, hazardous material drivers and FAA airman certificate holders.  The 24/7 ability also allows for recurrent vetting when new information is added to derogatory datasets.   In addition, the vetting capabilities provided through the program allows TSA to onboard and vet new population in an efficient and effective manner.  The ability to modify the vetting algorithms and the ability to conduct recurrent vetting as derogatory datasets are updated and modified offers TSA the ability to respond in real time to emerging threats and intelligence information.  If funding is diminished, it would eliminate a critical capability and component for TSA and the federal government in ensuring transportation and aviation security and protecting the homeland.","The Crew Vetting Program and associated vetting platform/engine continues to provide TTAC the capability to conduct vetting of over 20 million individuals on an annual basis covering more than 20 plus separate populations ranging from port workers, hazmat material drivers and individuals requesting access to all aspects of aviation infrastructures.  The infrastructure has the capability to quick on-board new population, perpetually vet all individuals on a daily basis with any changes to terrorism related derogatory datasets and maintain 24/7 operational capabilities.",The Crew Vetting Program vetting engine anticipates onboarding of additonal populations to be vetted by TTAC.  New populations planned for FY2012 and beyond include chemical facilities workers; ammonium nitrate workers; mass transit and rail workers. The onboarding of new anticipated populations in FY2011/FY2012 will be in addition to the estimated 32 million names to be vetted by system in the upcoming fiscal year.  The ability to vet so many names brings operational efficiency and effectiveness to TTAC's core capabilities and competencies in identifying potential threats to aviation and transportation security.   Also planned for FY2012 is CVP's goal to work closely with TTAC's Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) initiative to ensure seamless transition of technical capabilities and ensuring requirements are properly identified to facilitate the new TTAC vetting technical infrastructure.  The capability and capacity  to be delivered through CVP and in the future via TIM will allow for  efficient on-board of new populations outside the traditional TSA arena and provide DHS department wide capability to conduct vetting and protect the Homeland.,93.019,11.6,11.6,11.832,2003.0,2017.0,"There are no changes to the BY13-17 CIP at this time.

024-000005352,24,Department of Homeland Security,55,Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"The DRO Modernization (DROM) program is a Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) initiative to modernize the DRO IT systems. Managed under the ICE OCIO Automation and Modernization (AM) Program, the DROM mission is to support the systems upgrades and improvements of DRO business processes for the detention and removal of illegal aliens from the United States. The major goal of DROM is to create an efficient system and a streamlined process to minimize the length of detention, increase bed utilization and increase removals of aliens ordered removed from the U.S. Areas targeted as part of the Development, Modernization or Enhancement (DME) effort are: a) Real-time dynamic reporting on statistics and metrics for events from apprehension through the detention and removal process (aggregate and individual aliens); b) Removal management including alien case status information from apprehension to removal (e.g. awaiting credible-fear review, awaiting travel-document issuance); c) Detainee Management providing detainee tracking, property logging, and bed assignment data; d) Bed-space Management including ability to make reservation and cancellations and show availability of beds by location, relative likelihood of availability, and alien characteristic or classification; and e) Transportation management for efficient scheduling and routing detainees for detention and removal. Chief in the modernization is the replacement of the DRO legacy case management system  the Deportable Alien Control System (DACS)  with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based systems. This core requirement provides better flexibility in building applications and business processes in an agile manner to leverage existing DHS/ICE application infrastructure to compose the new DRO Web services. The program and requisite projects ensure DRO has the technical ability to continue to meet DHS goals and continue to contribute in supporting the DHS Secure Border Initiative (SBI); the 287(g) program providing state and local law enforcement officers support in identifying, processing, and when appropriate, detaining immigration offenders; the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) identifying criminal aliens while incarcerated and providing automated processing to remove aliens upon prison release; and other ICE enforcement initiatives.","At the time DROM was originally conceived, ERO systems lacked functionality in supporting the business needs of the organization. These systems also were poorly integrated & led to creation of duplicate sources of data that contributed to reduced data quality & unreliable performance & decision support metrics. The DROM Program was initiated to improve the effectiveness of ERO & strengthen ERO alignment with the Secure Border Initiative (SBI). The DROM Program modernizes ERO IT systems & automates manual processes with highly scalable robust IT solutions. DROM is focused on closing the following performance gaps: Integration & Information Sharing, Systems Automation, Systems Flexibility, Trend Analysis & Resource Management, Data Quality. DROM will focus on the following areas of the ERO mission: Reporting, Case Management, Detainee Location & Tracking, Bed Space Management, Transportation Management. The enhancements to these areas focus on removing current information silos, providing an ERO-wide view of removal operations, improving efficiency through the automation of manual processes, & providing enhanced reporting capabilities for executive & front-line decision makers. To date, DROM has narrowed the gaps in these areas and continues to make progress towards closing them. In FY13, DROM will complete development of the EARM-Executive Office for Immigrant Review (EOIR) system-to-system interface. The new interface will provide EOIR with real-time access to detainee case information in support of court-based activities & actions. These data provide courtroom officials real-time detainee information that aids in preventing the release of detainees that may pose a threat. The enhancements to EARM provide greater utilization & productivity of the system & provide ERO with the ability to perform automated business processes in a timely & efficient manner. Finally, integrating and interfacing the individual projects into EARM are vital activities that increase DROM's overall system functionality and effectiveness.  If funding is reduced, phase two of the EOIR interface will not be complete. This will result in EOIR not having access to real-time detainee case information in support of court-based activities. Also, the increased utilization of EARM will adversely impact system performance, thereby decreasing ERO's ability to complete automated business processes in a timely manner. These deficiencies will add time & expense to the detention & removal process.","EARMS V3 was released  May, 11. EARM V3 introduced new functionality to support the Alternatives to Detention Program (ATDP).  In addition EARMS V3 will also enhance the electronic Travel Documents (eTD) interface.  e-TD deployed two major releases in FY11, with expected release in July, 2011.DROM integrated the following standalone systems into the case management system of record: Electronic Bonds (e-Bonds) version 2; Fugitive Case Management System; Risk Assessment/Intake Classification; and Enforcement Priorities Reporting Support (aka Crime Button).

024-000005116,24,Department of Homeland Security,58,Customs and Border Protection,"Under LBI, CBP is capitalizing on the success of WHTI by reusing the capabilities developed for inbound vehicles in other mission areas:  pedestrian inbound, vehicle outbound, and Border Patrol checkpoints.  CBP is further leveraging these capabilities by integrating systems and sharing data across these missions.  This integrated approach and expanded scope is reflected in the program name change from WHTI to Land Border Integration (LBI). The original Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) investment allowed CBP to effectively address the requirements imposed by Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended, by the deadline of June 1, 2009.  The WHTI investment made modifications to inbound vehicle primary processing lanes at U.S. land border ports of entry.  LBI is leveraging WHTI developed RFID technologies, upgraded license plate readers (LPRs), and a greatly improved primary inspection application.  These capabilities were originally deployed under WHTI to ensure that inbound primary processing time would not increase as a result of the new WHTI documentary requirements (which could cause significant border crossing delays).  Instead, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options resulted in more efficient processing methods (20% - 60% faster than standard processing without RFID).  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The investment enhanced border security by reducing the number of acceptable documents that can be presented from thousands to a relative handful.  This reduced number of acceptable documents makes it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents due to increased familiarity with the documents.  LBI extends the benefit by ensuring that the vehicle and/or document data can be acquired not only on inbound, but on outbound and at Border Patrol checkpoints.  CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and the traveling public all benefit from the improvements introduced by LBI to land border crossings and checkpoints.","WHTI, addressed the key capability gaps for providing advanced information, streamlining documentation requirements, assembling comprehensive travel histories and enhanced intelligence and targeting rules.  CBP lacks these capabilities in other environments (pedestrian, outbound, checkpoint) and therefore lacks an integrated view of vehicles and people as they enter and leave the country. CBP is extending the WHTI capabilities to other mission areas. The Key Pedestrian Gaps are; no advanced traveler information; ineffective directional signage; insufficient tactical control (manual port absconder deterrent); travelers with and without compliant travel documents intermingled, creating an inefficient processing environment; limited biometric capability, resulting in extended processing times. If unfunded, security gaps will continue; port absconders will continue to put officers' lives at risk; and processing will remain labor intensive, and long waits will continue at the largest pedestrian crossings. Key Outbound Gaps - unlike inbound operations, most POEs do not have adequate infrastructure or technology to conduct effective outbound operations and intelligence gathering.  Outbound operations lack the basic tools inbound uses (LPR, RFID, VPC) to properly inspect vehicles and travelers.  Existing LPR technology is old, and does not contribute significantly to intelligence gathering.  Without funding, millions in cash and weapons will continue to cross the land border into Mexico, fueling the drug war, border violence, and the emerging violence on U.S. soil.  Failure to fund will continue to put American lives (officers and citizens) in danger. Key Checkpoint Gaps - BP checkpoints lack the basic information and technologies provided in the inbound vehicle environment: LPR, RFID, and VPC.  These technologies would provide and correlate license plate information and passenger document information to the Border Patrol Agent. In a limited one week test at a very small checkpoint - two arrests were made solely due to the mobile (handheld) LPR and document read capabilities - and the handheld is the least robust capability envisioned by CBP in the outbound environment. Without funding, BP agents will have little to no intelligence by which to conduct checkpoint inspections and protect the U.S. interior.  Failure to fund precludes CBP from providing needed vehicle and traveler intelligence to advance its targeting abilities.","WHTI Implemented the LBI Triangle Strategy (integration of information between inbound, outbound and OBP Checkpoint processing) including: deployed WHTI inbound technical solution on 10 lanes at 4 locations; began deployment of re-engineered pedestrian processing on 3 lanes at 1 location; piloted a Tier 3 outbound solution; began southwest border deployment of 1 Tier 1 outbound solution, 5 Tier 2 outbound solutions, and 36 Tier 3 outbound solutions. Deployed integrated LPR capability to 1 fixed and 14 tactical OBP checkpoints on the southwest border. Deployed the following lane optimizations to improve lane discipline and speed up processing of inbound traffic. Lane Flow Optimization involving the placement of descriptive signage within individual lanes and a paint scheme which reduces visual clutter and emphasizes locations within each lane. Ready Lanes for travelers with RFID-enabled travel documents at 12 locations.","Planned CY (FY2012) accomplishments include:- Pilot of pedestrian re-engineering deployment begun in FY 2011 (unfunded)- Begin upgrading Tier 3 outbound deployments to Tier 2 (24 locations) or Tier 1 (14 locations) - (unfunded)- Deployment of an additional 10 to 20 Border Patrol Checkpoints (unfunded)- Implement Ready Lanes, Variable Message Signage, and Lane Flow Optimization to additional crossings (funded)Planned BY (FY2013) accomplishments include:- Complete upgrading of Tier 3 outbound deployments begun in FY 2012 (unfunded)- Implement Ready Lanes, Variable Message Signage, and Lane Flow Optimization to additional crossings (funded)- Implement technology refresh of inbound technical solution deployed during FY2008 (unfunded).",554.187,75.78,76.5,76.5,2007.0,2019.0,"For FY 2013 in Table 1 there is a reduction from the FY 2012 President's Budget.

024-000006074,24,Department of Homeland Security,60,United States Coast Guard,"The PAWSS encompasses a number of vessel traffic data and administrative applications on integrated operator workstations installed in Vessel Traffic Centers, which are located in busy Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) ports. PAWSS is composed of VHF radio communications  and surveillance sensors (meteorological, hydrological, radar, Closed Circuit Television, and Automatic Identification Systems) that are integrated and interfaced to provide automated decision support. PAWSS provides a series of navigation safety related information systems that facilitate the safe and efficient transit of vessel traffic, thus reducing the risk of collision, ramming, grounding, and associated environmental damage. Gaps addressed: it enhances the good order and predictability of vessel traffic by providing clear, concise, accurate, meaningful, and timely advisories to mariners in each Area Of Responsibility (AOR) as defined in Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR), and Navigation and Navigable Waters, Part 161 [33 CFR 161]. PAWSS supports the 2002 Maritime Transportation Security Acts requirement for the Secretary of DHS to collect, integrate, and analyze information concerning vessels operating on or bound for waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. PAWSS enables VTS operators to respond to customer needs, helps safeguard U.S. waterways and enhances navigation safety throughout the VTS area. PAWSS has been deployed to 9 VTS ports and 1 System Maintenance and Engineering Facility. Approximately $68.6 million has been invested in this acquisition project, and it is one of the most comprehensive U.S. vessel traffic management systems. Recent enhancements include upgrades to the usability and functionality of the system interface for operators; the integration of additional sensors; and the interconnection of PAWSS with the Coast Guard Data Network, thereby enabling vessel traffic track data to be exported to the Maritime Domain Awareness community. The first beneficiaries of PAWSS are the vessels participating in VTS areas with PAWSS system who receive up-to-date vessel traffic management information and services provided through the PAWSS capabilities.

024-000005137,24,Department of Homeland Security,58,Customs and Border Protection,"The AFI Program is helping U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) evolve into an efficient, intelligence-driven organization.  Through previous accomplishments of the AFI Program and those scheduled for BY13, CBP will be better enabled to effectively secure U.S. borders against varied and numerous homeland security threats. AFI helps to facilitate the analysis, production, and dissemination of mission-critical intelligence to frontline CBP officers, other law enforcement partners, and where necessary, the intelligence community. To accomplish its objectives, the AFI Program consists of two coordinated projects.  These projects are: 1. AFI System Development-The AFI system provides additional capabilities to CBP in the gathering, analysis, information sharing, and reporting of critical intelligence information within CBP and other partners.  AFI will be deployed across the Unclassified, Secret, and Top Secret Networks. 2. Homeland Secure Data Network (HSDN) Infrastructure Buildout-The HSDN Infrastructure Buildout project provides for additional facilities throughout the country where CBP personnel can access HSDN and the Secret version of AFI. Program also included hiring of 27 GS-0132, Intelligence Research Specialists (IRS). During BY13, the AFI Program will build on existing AFI system development efforts by providing additional analytical and intelligence product capabilities to CBP intelligence analysts.  Significant capabilities scheduled for delivery include the broadening of the AFI user community beyond CBP to include other parts of DHS, including the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and other DHS components such as the Coast Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Within CBP, additional users from CBP field office and border patrol locations along the southern and northern borders will gain access to AFI and its intelligence product area for improved border security threat and situational awareness. Additional HSDN facilities will be brought online and with development of AFI at the Secret and Top Secret levels, AFI access on these classified networks will begin to be available in CBP HSDN locations. The AFI PMO will oversee all programmatic aspects of the AFI Program during BY13 and will continue to work within CBP and DHS to identify additional efficiency and cost savings that can be realized through continued development of the AFI System and HSDN facilities. Only dependencies are with HSDN project and the DHS HSDN contract.","The AFI Program will narrow performance gaps related to the timely production and dissemination of intelligence products to CBP users in the field as well as to CBP partners in the law enforcement and intelligence communities. CBP intelligence analysts today spent significant amounts of time in the manual and time-intensive process collecting data that then requires additional analysis.  For a typical intelligence product, the analyst will login and search a variety of CBP, DHS, and open source data systems and then work to find common themes and elements from which to develop an intelligence product that could have significant operational impact for CBP.  We have anecdotal evidence that an intelligence analyst spends roughly 75% of their time searching for data and only 25% rigorously analyzing it.  Through AFI, we intend to reverse that level of effort so that significantly less time is spent searching for information and more time assessing trends, linkages, and potential threats to the United States.  The capability that AFI brings to search multiple data systems from a single search interface will not be limited just to this program, but has the potential for adaptation to a number of other CBP, and potentially DHS, programs.  AFI is working to simplify the process of creating intelligence products that meet the needs of various users as well as requirements of other CBP data systems.  There are some intelligence report types stored in multiple data systems that require the same information but have varying mechanisms for producing the report. An analyst may prepare three different reports for three different systems that all require basically the same information.

The NCPS consists of the hardware, software, supporting processes, training, and services that are being developed and acquired to support the Departments mission requirements as delineated in the CNCI and mandated in NSPD-54/ HSPD-23.  NSD is responsible for the development, acquisition, deployment and support required to implement the NCPS. NSD supports the Departments mission through QHSR Goal 4.1, Create a Safe, Secure, and Resilient Cyber Environment. NCPS is independent of other Department cybersecurity systems. The primary beneficiary of NCPS is the Federal Executive Branch civilian government. NCPS currently consists of discrete increments, also referred to as Blocks or EINSTEIN 2 and 3.   These blocks roll out in successive but overlapping phases. EINSTEIN 2 (Block 2.0) enables the analysis of network flow information to identify potential malicious activity of traffic entering or exiting Federal Government civilian networks using signature-based intrusion detection technology. Blk 2.0 is in steady state.  Block 2.1 is a spiral release of Block 2.0, and adds a Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) solution. With the addition of this SIEM capability, the NCPS will maintain the following capabilities: correlation of disparate data source events, data normalization, automatic correlation analysis, intelligent event monitoring, advanced threat visualization, and analytics. Blk 2.1 is in DME. Block 2.2 augments the visualization of Department and Agency threat information and provides an advanced mechanism for information sharing and collaboration, tiered to support multiple user communities. It provides a Common Operating Picture of the threat landscape of Federal Executive Branch civilian networks as generated from D/A data sets, allowing for advanced visualization, analysis, and workflow capabilities. Blk 2.2 is in DME in FY13. EINSTEIN 3 (Block 3.0) represents the next evolution of protection for civilian departments/agencies within the Federal Government.  This approach will draw on commercial technology and specialized government technology to conduct intrusion prevention and threat-based decision-making on network traffic entering or leaving. Blk 3.0 is in DME.","The NCPS Program aligns to Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) Goal 4.1: Create a Safe, Secure, and Resilient Cyber Environment.

The Common Operational Picture (COP) is a shared understanding of information across all aspects of the operating environment. This is accomplished using modern electronic components, such as interoperable radio and satellite communication systems and improved optical/radar sensors, that can improve visual sightings and can detect maritime targets in all weather conditions, and by using an interoperable network to bring all operational and intelligence data together, transforming that data into operationally-focused, intelligence-infused information in a Common Operating Picture (COP). The C4ISR Project provides an integrated Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance suite of systems that are interoperable across all Coast Guard ships, aircraft, and shore sites to provide the eyes and ears for mission execution.  The system will help fill our gap in maritime domain awareness identified in the post-9/11 Deepwater mission needs statement.  This system will provide operational commanders, ship COs, aircraft commanders, and operational planners, the tools, intelligence, and common operating picture necessary to survey, detect, classify, identify, and prosecute intended targets; the cornerstone of ALL Coast Guard and DHS missions.  In FY12, the project intends to deliver a federated C4ISR baseline (Segment 2) for installation on NSC, HC-130J, and HC-144A.

024-000005052,24,Department of Homeland Security,58,Customs and Border Protection,"The Automated Targeting System, or ATS, is a web - based enforcement and decision support tool that is the cornerstone for all CBPs targeting efforts. ATS incorporates intelligence information and technologies to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for examinations and passengers for inspection. In this way, ATS allows Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers that most warrant further attention. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of a passenger, import, or export in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subjected to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analysis, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS consists of modules that provide selectivity and targeting capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. Currently ATS consists of several modules that focus on exports, imports, passengers, land border private vehicle crossings, and import trends over time.The primary beneficiaries of ATS are:  CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO), CBP Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison (OIIL), CBP Office of International Trade (OT), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). There are no dependencies between ATS and other investments''''.","The ATS systems have allowed the CBP Officers to process large volumes of data efficiently.  However, as volumes increase in people, cargo and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to information and more information on which to base crictical admission decisions.

024-000005119,24,Department of Homeland Security,58,Customs and Border Protection,"The Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) Systems Program (large scale and small scale) supports the detection and prevention of contraband, including weapons of mass effect, illicit radioactive materials, illicit drugs, currency and other illegal contraband, from entering or furthering their entry into the U.S.  The program is vital to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) layered enforcement strategy.  The NII Program seeks to match the technology and equipment with the conditions and requirements at, and between, domestic ports of entry and U.S. facilities that process international mail; and helps ensure CBP can meet its goal to inspect 100 percent of all targeted high-risk shipments.  The programs business objective is to optimize deployment of NII across every air, land and sea port of entry given identified risks and available funds.  To achieve this objective, CBP considers factors such as traffic volumes, types and density levels of imported commodities, port infrastructure constraints, and appropriate mix of equipment, as well as commercial technology and cost effectiveness.  This also means pursuing a mix of technologies designed to complement one another and present a layered defense to smuggling attempts while efficiently processing a significant volume of passengers and trade. The primary beneficiaries of the NII Systems Program are American citizens who benefit from its contribution to Preventing Terrorism, Enhancing National Security, and Securing and Managing U.S. borders; and CBP Officers and Border Patrol Agents who are protected from exposure to potentially hazardous materials when they use NII technologies to inspect cargo and conveyances for contraband. The NII systems are stand-alone technologies and are not connected to a network. As such, there are no electronic dependencies. However, the program depends on support from the CBP Office of Information Technologys (OIT) Enforcement Technology Program to maintain and dispose of NII systems and on the OIT Technology Training and Support Program for NII training assistance.","The use of NII technologies increases the probability of discovering weapons and other destructive devices and preventing their entry into the United States. NII technologies also help identify undeclared currency and contraband, preventing their being smuggled into the United States. As identification and interdiction increase through the use of NII equipment, the program becomes more of a deterrent because it imposes a high cost on illegal activity. Once CBP successfully interdicts contraband at a rate that is painful to the smuggling organizations, criminals change their mode of operation to avoid the types of inspections that are successful.  Gap: The Program will have 74 pieces of NII equipment that have reached the end of their life-cycle by the end of FY13. The use of the older technologies increases the risk of equipment failure, difficulty in obtaining parts and increased maintenance costs. Assessment of program impact if investment is not fully funded: The NII Systems Program will be in the operations and maintenance phase in FY13-17. There are no new acquisition dollars and limited replacement dollars reflected in the FY13-17 Resource Allocation Plan. As such, CBP will conduct further assessments to identify alternatives and develop strategies to ensure mission goals are achieved.

This equipment is serviced and repaired by technicians and service personnel located in numerous geographical locations across the country.  The personnel are not Government FTE, but are personnel provided via service contracts and the funding for them is categorized as services therefore EVM is not required. The NII Systems Program is managed using established project management processes and procedures, and coordinates with the system contractors to ensure successful system integration and handles problems associated with site-related issues. A DHS-warranted contracting officer administers the contracts, and a COTR is assigned to each contract to manage contract performance. To ensure performance, each contractor is required to work with the COTR to do the following:  submit a project management plan that details the required deliverables and resources dedicated to the completion of the project; provide a series of technical reviews, such as a kick-off meeting (within 20 days of award), systems review (within 40 days of award), final configuration review (within 60 days of award), factory acceptance test meeting, and quarterly reviews; provide monthly progress reports that contain at a minimum the major milestones, open action items, program hazards, man-hours scheduled to perform, major activities new month, and cost data (quarterly); preparing and submitting an acceptance test plan to the NII Systems program for approval and performing the tests necessary to ensure the equipment is operating as specified in the plan; work with the NII Systems Program team to conduct its own factory acceptance tests when requested; and work with the NII Systems program team to conduct the final operational test (site acceptance test) at the POE to ensure compliance with the CBP-developed government acceptance test plan for the respective equipment type.",3,"The NII program is a key component to CBP's layered defense against smuggling while efficiently processing a significant volume of passengers and trade. The program's inspection time is close to 1/16th of the manual inspection time, which has improved the efficiency of the point of entry inspection process. The benefits of this system had reduced the threat to life and property due to terrorism and increased CBP Officer/Border Patrol Agent safety. NII is a well-managed program; however the program's funding was significantly reduced due to budget cuts. The negative impacts from the budget cuts are the program will have to move to the sustainment phase, there will be a delay in purchasing replacement NII equipment that has reached end of life, and there will be no NII equipment for new or enhanced ports. CBP anticipates no impact on the deployment schedule for NII Systems that are already purchased and is assessing any alternatives to resolve the funding cuts.

HRIT funds plan for, acquire, configure, and implement COTS/GOTS packages and eGov/HRLoB shared services to consolidate, modernize, and/or replace HRIT systems at the Enterprise-level.  The program is governed by the HRIT Executive Steering Committee (ESC), established per Deputy Secretary guidance.  Once IT solutions have been acquired and deployed to DHS components, their Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is funded via Component contributions to Working Capital Funds (WCF).''The DHS Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) and Component HC Executives, in partnership with the Chief Information Officer (CIO), have redefined a long-term strategic plan for HRIT through a Human Capital Segment Architecture (HCSA) study.  The goal of the study was to develop a new strategy to deliver a more efficient, consolidated, modernized suite of Enterprise-level HRIT solutions to provide core HR functionality and data access across all of DHS. While DHS currently operates four enterprise solutions: NFC Corporate (Payroll/Personnel), EmpowHR (Personnel), webTA (Time and Attendance), and the eOPF (Electronic Personnel Folders); there remains a critical need for additional HR enterprise solutions in areas such as end-to-end hiring, performance management and personnel accountability for continued operations.  By consolidating and modernizing existing multiple, independent platforms, this strategy benefits HR offices and employees across DHS by leveraging common solutions, increasing process automation and system interoperability, and eliminating duplicative systems and applications and associated independent contract vehicles, all of which will result in increased efficiencies for the DHS HR community.  The strategy also benefits ongoing efforts to implement One DHS by simplifying data access and improving data consistency across the Department, resulting in more timely, accurate Department-level HR reporting.  The current strategy focuses on acquisition and implementation of new HRIT solutions; however the long-term strategy will also involve centralized management of the HRIT portfolio across the Enterprise and will become interdependent with other DHS IT investments.","By means of the Human Capital Segment Architecture (HCSA) study, HCBS has led an initiative to identify performance gaps and areas for potential enterprise solution consolidation to achieve efficiencies across the DHS enterprise.  The HCSA initiative has identified 15 Strategic Investment Opportunities (SIOs), involving over 50 potential projects that will meet enterprise business needs and provide upgrades for more efficient, consolidated Enterprise solutions.  HCBS anticipates completion of the study in FY 2011 and initial implementation of high priority SIOs beginning in FY 2012.  Pending approval by the HRIT Executive Steering Committee (ESC), HCBS plans to initiate the following high priority SIOs immediately in FY 2012:   -- Implement an Enterprise Performance Management solution   -- Improve Data Reporting   -- Implement Document Management to support Consolidated Case Management capabilities   -- Deploy an interim Position Description LibraryA failure to fully fund this effort would reduce Enterprise-wide efficiencies and service level improvements, as well as associated cost savings expected to result from ongoing deployments and the implementation of the results of the HCSA study.  This reduction would impede the ability to achieve Department-level integration of processes and data, and ultimately efforts to integrate HR processes and systems supporting the One DHS principle.  Failure to fully fund the Working Capital Fund operations and Maintenance (O&M) portion of the HR IT budget would result in temporary suspension of key services such as processing of payroll or time and attendance tracking.","In FY 2011, HCBS completed a number of enterprise system upgrades, as well as the deployment of WebTA to CIS.  HCBS completed a Business Case Analysis (BCA) for Learning Management Systems (LMS) and developed a transition plan for the implementation of an Enterprise LMS system. HCBS also continued development of a potential Enterprise-level reporting tool, began development of an Enterprise Personnel Accountability System (PAS) solution, and conducted the HCSA study.  HCBS also continued to provide support for the OPM-led initiative to develop USAJOBS 3.0.  HCBS completed the HCSA study in FY 2011, the implementation of which will result in improved operational efficiency through a more comprehensive, focused approach to the acquisition and deployment of consolidated Enterprise HRIT solutions.  HCBS provided O&M support for deployed systems, such as EmpowHR and WebTA through the HCBS and NFC Working Capital Funds.","In FY 2012, HCBS will deploy EmpowHR to FEMA and complete migration of OIG to the DHS instance of WebTA.  HCBS will also develop the selected PAS solution, and complete the first phase of  PAS deployments to FEMA, USCIS, ICE, FLETC, and DHS HQ. Pilot development and testing of the potential Enterprise-level reporting tool and support of USAJOBS 3.0 development will also be continued, and HCBS will complete solution engineering and acquisition of a Balanced Workforce  Survey Tool. HCBS will continue to provide O&M support for deployed systems such as EmpowHR and WebTA through the WCFs, including transition of full hosting of WebTA to NFC.  The HSCA study results are still pending HRIT ESC approval, however, six top priorities have been selected for immediate implementation.

024-000007001,24,Department of Homeland Security,70,Federal Emergency Management Agency,"The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) has two major components. First is IPAWS-OPEN, an application and data center infrastructure that provides alert aggregation, authentication, and dissemination to multiple communications media. Communications media include radio via the EAS, cellular phones via the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS), NOAA All Hazards Radio, TV, Internet, and social media services. Authenticated government officials at all levels nationwide can access the system. The second component of IPAWS is the EAS Primary Entry Point (PEP) Expansion and Modernization program. PEP stations are commercial radio stations with additional FEMA-supplied capabilities that allow stations to operate and broadcast alert and warning messages under all-hazards. The IPAWS Program is expanding the number of PEP radio stations to provide direct coverage to 90% of the U.S. population and is modernizing legacy PEP stations with retrofitted fuel systems, all-hazard protection, and redundant communications equipment. A National EAS Test will also be conducted to assess the operational readiness and effectiveness of the EAS system. These components benefit mission delivery by ensuring coverage of existing gaps in the emergency communication chain. IPAWS will reduce the risk of system failure in delivering life saving information. The American people are the primary beneficiaries of IPAWS. Additional beneficiaries of the program are the government emergency management personnel at all levels. IPAWS is working to bring about the successful integration of existing technologies through a collaboration of organizations having the same goal  saving lives and property. In the end, emergency managers at State, local and tribal levels will be able to alert their communities using more communications channels than they currently have available to them. The expansion and modernization of the Primary Entry Point (PEP) system, the adoption and use of standard protocols for messages, and the capability of State and local governments to send text warnings via mobile devices all ensure that timely alerts and warnings can be sent over more communications pathways and reach more Americans. The IPAWS Program is solely dependent upon the voluntary participation of the private sector and their participation as broadcast stations and mobile device capability providers. Without the private sector, IPAWS would not be able to function.","There are a number of capability gaps in the communications chain from the Government to the public which could fail and impact delivery of alert and warning messages. This investment closes significant performance gaps. First, the initial Emergency Alert System (EAS) capability only provided direct coverage for 66% of the American population. With the expansion of the system, Primary Entry Point (PEP) broadcast stations will be able to broadcast alerts and warnings to more than 90% of the population. In addition to expanding the EAS infrastructure, measures are being taken to upgrade existing infrastructure in order to provide better protection and capability measures.  Overall, this will provide a more reliable and resilient alert and warning system.  The second performance gap, a recognized need for an alternative message delivery channel using Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), will be closed with the deployment of IPAWS-OPEN. IPAWS-OPEN is deploying a nationwide capability to aggregate and distribute alert and warnings messages created using CAP. Distribution channels will provide Federal, State, territorial, tribal, and local alert and warning authorities a broad range of messaging capabilities through multiple pathways that includes radio, television, cellular phones, and internet technologies. The implementation of the Commercial Mobile Alerting System (CMAS) will close a significant performance gap.  The American people no longer rely solely on a single source of information. Alerting techniques, procedures and methods have changed rapidly and the integration of CMAS as part of IPAWS ensures that a greater segment of the population will be able to receive alerts and warnings from Federal, state, local, tribal or territorial officials.  Finally, the implementation of a National test of the EAS will ensure the infrastructure and capability are ready to be used in the event of an all hazards emergency.  The IPAWS Program cannot withstand further funding reductions in the current year, budget year or out-years.  The Program experienced significant budget reductions for FY11-17 resulting in a $47.0M funding gap between approved program funds and the life cycle cost estimate. This has caused delays in the PEP modernization schedule and has eliminated funding for contingency reserves, market research of alert and warning capabilities for Non-English Speaking and Functionally Disabled Americans, and emerging technologies.",A.

024-000005536,24,Department of Homeland Security,55,Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a clear mission to share its collected law enforcement (LE) information with Federal, State, Local, Tribal (SLT), and International LE partners, as well as with intelligence and homeland security agencies in accordance with privacy rights, civil liberties, and criminal justice laws and regulations. The DHS LE Information Sharing Initiative (LEISI) provides the business sponsorship for LE information sharing initiatives, directing business operations, program management and stakeholder management support to the various LE initiatives that the Department and its components undertake. Presidential and Congressional mandates such as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 call for the sharing of federal LE information and for the advancement of the DHS-ISE (Information Sharing Environment) and Federal ISE. The functional capabilities included in the Enforcement Information Sharing (EIS) support s these mandates and the DHS mission by providing ICE agents information sharing capabilities to acquire, analyze, and appropriately share intelligence and other information  to indentify criminal activity and disrupt criminal and terrorist organizations.  EIS is an umbrella program that pairs current efforts with new development efforts to support the common goal of providing sophisticated information sharing capabilities to the law enforcement community. EIS will close this capability gap by: Enhancing the information sharing web service and identifying new partners; Continuing to develop and add functionality to the existing information sharing components, and; Creating a centralized access point for ICE and other DHS task forces, agents, and analysts. The primary beneficiaries of the EIS Investment include: ICE Agents , ICE Office of Intelligence (Intel) and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) will use added capabilities such as, additional data sets, expanded search capabilities, lead generation,  geospatial analysis and Global Name Recognition applications to provide better tools to their agents in conducting their investigations. SLT LE entities who will use LEIS Service to establish bi-directional connectivity between DHS and external partners. EIS is not dependent on any other system but through the LEIS Service is able to share information.","The primary system of the EIS Program, ICEPIC, is currently not capable of expanding to fully support the DHS mission and the Presidential and Congressional mandates for information sharing, nor will it allow for the expansion of Law Enforcement (LE) partners and types of law enforcement data to be shared. Without the EIS Program, the expansion of additional data sources and data types would be halted and DHS would be unable to meet the needs of its LE partners.The ICE EIS Program is comprised of distinct, but cooperative efforts designed to enhance and modernize DHS's information sharing capabilities.  As set forth in both Presidential and Congressional mandates, DHS has a clear mission to share its collected law enforcement information with Federal, State, Local, Tribal (SLT) and International LE partners.  EIS is an umbrella program that strategically groups efforts currently underway with new development efforts, all of which support the common goal of providing sophisticated information sharing capabilities to the LE community.  An integrated information sharing service that can facilitate bi-directional connectivity among DHS and its LE partners is a work in progress.   The purpose of the EIS program is to close this performance gap by:(i)                 Enhancing the information sharing web service and identifying new partners(ii)               Continuing to develop and add functionality to the existing information sharing components(iii)             Creating a centralized access point for ICE agents, analyst, task forces and other DHS component officersIn an effort to address information sharing issues, the President established DHS and Congress mandated better coordination with SLT LE partners. A web service was built (the LEIS Service) to enable SLT partners to access various ICE databases, but not all SLT partners are connected through this service.  ICE must continue to expand these efforts, connect with more SLT LE partners, integrating more information into ICEPIC. If EIS is not funded then the EIS program will not be able to expand to additional sharing partners, increase additional data sources and data elements, and provide additional capabilities that would aid ICE agents conducting their investigations.","-   Completed Hardware upgrade to support migration to new RELRES software 4.2 and re-ingestion of expanded set of data sources to improved entity resolution and better sort capability.-    Completed development of Search UI to improve ease of use, provide enhanced search capabilities, and improved results sets. -   Completed the Requirements for Launching Panel to provide a single point of entry for ICE agents to all enforcement applications. -   Completed Planning and hardware purchases for the Data Center Move (DCM).- Added sharing partners- AZLink (Tucson, Maricopa, Mesa, Phoenix PD), LInX National Capital Region (NCR), State Department Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) -   Completed design and development of LEX 3.1 schema that will provide a more robust data sharing capabilities by increasing the data elements that can be shared. -    Completed development of phase 1 of the leads generation capability allowing leads generation from multiple sources.",EIS has experienced reductions in budget limiting or eliminating its ability to expand or service new law enforcement customers.

LSCMS Phase 1 began in 2006 with implementation of a COTS solution for ordering and warehouse management in two FEMA Regions.  Phase 1 was expanded through FY2009 to include support for requests, FEMA Incident Support Bases, and semi-automated orders/shipments for three FEMA strategic partners. LSCMS Phase 2 began with award of a full and open solution competition in September 2009.  Phase 2 Initial Operational Capability in 2011 implements warehouse management at all FEMA Distribution Centers, and provides hand held capture of receipt and shipment information at field sites.  Phase 2 Full Operational Capability in summer 2012 will integrate requests and orders for disaster goods, support acquisition of transportation resources from commercial carriers, upgrade the LSCMS COTS SW and technical environment to a DHS/FEMA EA compliant Service Oriented Architecture running in the FEMA Consolidated Services Infrastructure at DHS Hosting Centers, and leverage the FEMA enterprise SOA GSS for external interfaces with Citi Groups 3rd party payment system for disaster transportation carriers. ''LSCMS replaces ad hoc manual processes with standardized processes leveraging state of the art industry software and best practices.  It provides improved efficiency, effectiveness, and visibility at each stage of the end-to-end disaster supply chain.  Primary beneficiaries include: FEMA logistics HQ and field operations staff who use LSCMS to respond to disasters; FEMA logistics managers who use LSCMS information to plan and manage disaster response; DLA/GSA/USACE and other partners who receive disaster orders and provide shipment information through LSCMS; DHS, higher authorities, and State executives who leverage LSCMS situational awareness; and disaster survivors who rely on LSCMS to ensure disaster goods they need are delivered at the right time to the right place.","The Logistics Supply Chain Management System (LSCMS) Program supports FEMA's mission of responding to all hazards expediently and efficiently by managing the nation's end-to-end supply chain of disaster assets and commodities. LSCMS addresses performance gaps identified in the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, SEC. 636. LOGISTICS, which identified the lack of an efficient, transparent, and flexible logistics system for procurement and delivery of goods and services necessary for an effective and timely response to natural disasters, and Recommendation 38 from the President's report on Hurricane Katrina which identified the need to provide full disaster logistics supply chain visibility to FEMA and its partners. LSCMS addresses these gaps by providing systems and processes for managing the disaster supply chain including initial request for assets and commodities, orders to FEMA and partners, transportation of disaster goods, inventory management at FEMA locations, shipment, and receipt by the States. LSCMS provides situational awareness and in-transit visibility through reporting and GIS mapping capabilities showing in-transit location of disaster shipments.  LSCMS  will provide FEMA with the flexibility to respond to and recover from all-threat disasters, and provide logistics supply chain management capabilities and systems to ensure that the right assets are delivered in the right quantities to the right locations at the right time to meet the public's needs.  LSCMS full operational capability is scheduled for 2012, including new application SW, support for requests for disaster goods, management of transportation of disaster goods, and migration to DHS hosting center.

024-000009561,24,Department of Homeland Security,65,National Protection and Programs Directorate,"ADIS is a core operational system for US-VISIT with a useful life cycle of 8 years (FY 2010-17). The annual Operational Analysis has confirmed the useful life of the investment. ADIS collects arrival and departure information on non-U.S. citizens traveling to the United States as well as current immigration status updates for each traveler. ADIS receives information from multiple systems and matches events to a unique person to create a complete record of events during a visit. Contributing systems are IDENT, SEVIS, CLAIMS3, and TECS. ADIS matches traveler departures with arrivals to check compliance. It stores travel and status adjustment records and provides ad hoc queries and reporting capabilities. ADIS incorporates additional data elements and transactions associated with all US-VISIT systems and other immigration systems to maintain complete traveler histories for nearly 170 million travelers. Data includes biographic and biometric identifiers and information for law enforcement and other stakeholders. ADIS receives 100 percent of all system-confirmed arrivals and all air/sea arrival and departure manifests, along with Form I-94/I-94W departure records. ADIS uses 16 high-end servers at both DHS data centers and processes more than 1 million transactions a day. ADIS O&M costs include support for infrastructure management (hardware), application management (product support and help desk support), and network and data center support. Services are growing to support more stakeholders and users, including a 24/7 help desk and system uptime reliability at 99 percent or greater. ADIS performance is measured through the availability and accuracy of the system and its ability to generate law enforcement leads, including the number of in-country visa overstay violator records, which are manually verified and forwarded to ICE for further investigation. The US-VISIT Data Integrity Group reviews and analyzes data from ADIS, IDENT, and nine other systems to support interior enforcement activities by ICE.","ADIS was developed to address the lack of a comprehensive, integrated system to track entry to and exit from the U.S.  Prior to ADIS, the Non-immigrant Information System (NIIS) was used to house all information from Form I-94 arrival and departure portions and was largely paper intensive. The 9/11 Commission noted that several of the airplane hijackers had overstayed the terms of their admission and Congress has expressed continuing concern about visa overstays in the United States.  Determining if foreign nationals have overstayed their allowed periods of admission enhances homeland security and provides a cost-effective means responsive to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the U.S. ADIS is the only system in the federal government that can provide visa overstay data, which is a critical component in determining whether Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries can remain eligible for visa waiver status.  Further, ADIS integration with nine other automated systems is responsive to the direction from the 9/11 Commission to breakdown information silos and provide more comprehensive and investigative intelligence leads to enforcement, intelligence, and adjudicative agencies. Failure to fully fund ADIS would deprive the Government of the performance enhancements described above.  More specifically, the U.S. Government would not be able to determine whether VWP countries are adhering to conditions required for them to remain eligible for visa waiver status.  ICE would be deprived of its largest source of investigative leads for visa overstays.  In FY 2011 alone, US-VISIT referred over 48,000 leads to ICE resulting in 121 arrests.  Further, through use of ADIS and its related systems in FY 2011, US-VISIT established more than 16,000 lookouts to assist CBP in visa violators who might seek re-entry into the U.S.  These lookouts resulted in more than 3,000 POE or visa refusals during FY 2011.","During FY 2011, ADIS operations allowed US-VISIT analysts to surpass FY 2010 levels of examinations of overstay records of ICE overstay arrests, out-of-country lookouts created, and POE/visa refusals. Since FY 2007, US-VISIT analysts, using ADIS and its connectivity to other systems, have contributed to well over 2200 arrests of overstay violators and more than 7200 refusals of visa requests.  US-VISIT adhered to quality standards for lead referrals while reducing all unvetted (nonpriority) overstay records by more than 70 percent when compared to FY 2009. US-VISIT Data Integrity Group (DIG) analysts reduced the backlog of in-country overstay violators by more than 580,000 records in FY 2011. US-VISIT provided more than 3,841 overstay leads to ICE in FY 2011 from reviews of previously unvetted populations, and completed these additional reviews without impacting the reviews of priority overstay records and lead recommendations to ICE.","FY 2012Maintain ADIS operational availability at 97% or better - This is the ratio of the time that ADIS is available to process end-user transactions during the period divided by the total scheduled uptime for that period.

024-000009560,24,Department of Homeland Security,65,National Protection and Programs Directorate,"IDENT is a core operational steady-state system for US-VISIT and is the largest fingerprint repository and biometric-matching system in the world. The useful life of the investment is 8 years (FY 2010-17). The annual Operational Analysis has confirmed the useful life of the investment. IDENT processes more than 165,000 transactions per day for DHS and the Department of State, as well as other stakeholders. IDENT has over 120 million individual fingerprint records and contains biometric data for legitimate travelers to the U.S., immigration benefit seekers, visa applicants, individuals seeking credentialing benefits, and immigration violators; and has information on known or suspected terrorists (KSTs), criminals, sexual offenders, domestic and international fugitives, officer safety threats, military detainees, other persons of interest, other egregious offenders, and subjects who are otherwise inadmissible to the United States. IDENT compares a subjects fingerprints against stored fingerprint records. Identity is determined within 10 seconds or less (on average) against the watchlist (highly actionable) subset. IDENT has identified more than 60,000 criminals, immigration violators, and KSTs. IDENTs system architecture is made up of approximately 600 servers, more than 140 highly specialized fingerprint matchers, and 130 terabytes of data storage. This growth rate of 1.2M fingerprint records per month is expected to continue through FY 2012 and beyond, which requires a continuous investment in IDENT IT infrastructure. IDENT services include a 24/7 help desk, and system uptime is maintained at 99 percent or greater in accordance with service level agreements. IDENTs performance is measured through the systems ability to successfully meet service level agreements with US-VISIT customers related to the timeliness, accuracy and availability of the system. Specific performance metrics include average biometric watchlist search times for queries from Ports of Entry and Department of State consular offices, system uptime and biometric-matching accuracy.","IDENT enables DHS to comply with legislative, operational, and executive mandates to increase the certainty involved in identity verification and watchlist matching through analysis of biometrics.  Biometrics provide unique, reliable and forgery resistant capabilities for identity verification. The demand for IDENT services continues its rapid growth in response to the needs of such users as the FBI, DOD, DOS, USCG, CBP, ICE, USCIS, and State and local governments. IDENT enables its users to determine identity with more certainty which protects the nation from dangerous individuals. A failure to fund IDENT would be tantamount to failure to comply with legislation that requires biometric identity verification of foreign travelers seeking travel visas and arriving at POEs. Further, US-VISIT would lose the capability to comply with the Congressional and Executive Branch mandates to achieve interoperability with FBI IAFIS.  The IDENT user agencies would be deprived of biometric identity verification and watchlist matching for use in determining admissibility or eligibility for immigration benefits. The IDENT capability to provide rapid identification of KSTs, criminal aliens, and repeat immigration violators, even if such individuals try to conceal their true identities by using aliases or fraudulent travel documents, would be seriously compromised.  Failure to fully fund IDENT would compromise its ability as the DHS target biometric vetting service to support to the ICE Secure Communities program and the DHS Preventing and Combating Serious Crime (PCSC) initiative.","In FY11, US-VISIT adhered to SLAs for supporting customers while experiencing growth of approximately 12 percent in transaction volume and over a 14 million record increase in gallery size over FY10 levels. The growth in gallery size particularly challenges the accuracy and timeliness of IDENT responses. At the end of FY11, IDENT contained over 132 million fingerprint records of legitimate travelers to the United States, immigration-benefit seekers, and immigration violators. In FY11, IDENT processed 47.2 million transactions, 9 million more than in FY 2010. Over 547,000 persons were biometrically matched against the US-VISIT watchlist.

Current duplicate entries enhance the likelihood of human error and may delay the delivery of the appropriate care. Real-time reporting of medical information remains unavailable to IHSC to respond to requests from leadership, making it very difficult to respond quickly to inquiries regarding the detained population.  The results are increased cost of care, limited quality of care improvements, increased staffing costs due to workflow inefficiency, and partially electronic  medical records. Other challenges include: providing appropriate, timely information enterprise-wide to guide custody decisions (e.g. medical alerts and identification of detainees with infectious diseases like Tuberculosis); electronic tracking of medical tasks due to special medical needs of detainees; and, ensuring accurate workload reporting and quality auditing.The eHR-S solution acquired by this investment will allow IHSC to replace the legacy systems; enhance its capabilities to manage healthcare provided to detainees; improve compliance with standardized clinical practices to reduce negative patient outcomes (e.g., medication errors, unexpected detainee deaths, and limited access to healthcare); reduce costs (by eliminating duplicate data entry, medical tests, and improving data accessibility); improve communications with ICE staff to ensure that medical conditions are factored into custody and transport decisions; enhance medical management and oversight;  provide data exchange/sharing capabilities to facilitate faster and timely dissemination of information; reduce risk within the overall system (both medical and legal); and, migrate paper-based medical systems to an electronic system, in compliance with federal laws and regulations.Failure to fully fund will result in: failure to address current systemic problems; failure to replace legacy Health IT applications (CaseTrakker, MedEZ, CIPS); failure to achieve improvements in medical operational effectiveness and efficiency (potentially saving $297M in cost avoidance over 10 yr); and, failure to satisfy recommendation #10 from the OIG-08-52 report.","FY11 funding supported the program planning and acquisition of a COTS/GOTS/SaaS electronic health record solution with mimimal customization that will be delivered in phases. FY11 funding was also used to complete the eHR Acquisition and Validation Study that produced and delivered the key business and investment documents (Market Research, AoA, CBA, CEBD, LCCE); and, assessed IHSC current state staffing, data governance, and communication strategy to develop transition recommendations to assist in deployment of the EHR.","In FY12, the program will complete the acquisition and development activities to: acquire the eHR-S Increment-1, conduct solution design and development activities; support IHSC transition preparation activities for deployment of the new solution; complete privacy act, paperwork reduction act, and security assurance clearances; conduct system user/integration/acceptance and operational test and evaluation activities; deploy the solution to the test, training, and pre-staging environments; and recieve authority to operate.In FY13, Increment 1 will be deployed to 22 IHSC staffed facilities (including IHSC HQ).

FAMSNet components include, but are not limited to, desktops, laptops, Personal Electronic Devices (PEDs) and other wireless devices, telephones, video telecommunications equipment, printers, network and security hardware, software and infrastructure systems.   FAMSNet facilitates access to FAMS information systems including, but not limited to, email, database access, file sharing, printing, and a number of critical administrative and enforcement related programs.  FAMSNet's primary beneficiary is the FAMS, Other beneficiaries include DHS, FBI, FAA, DOJ, and other law enforcement agencies.  The FAMSNet Transportation Information Sharing System (TISS) is utilized by state, local, and airport authorities in the logging and reporting of suspicious as well as addressed incidents. FY11 enhancements to FAMSNet include efforts to mobile-enhance current desktop applications so that they are available to FAMs in mission status, via PED.  The FAMSNet air to ground component continues to expand with over 1000 aircraft now equipped with communication capabilities, with aircraft equipage continuing into FY12 and beyond.

The TIM Program will receive services from other Federal agencies such as the FBI and Terrorist Screening Center. The TIM objectives align with TSAs strategic goals including innovative use of analytical and detection technologies and techniques to collect and manage information regarding potential threats to persons, cargo, and commerce in the transportation arena and to disseminate relevant transportation security and intelligence information to appropriate entities in a timely and functional manner. The development of the TIM System will result in an integrated, end-to-end solution to manage identities, credentials, and assessment results for millions of transportation sector workers resulting in more accurate and timely integration of information directed at the identification of terrorist threats. The TIM acquisition strategy provides for the implementation of a service oriented architecture framework, mission services, and service capabilities while considering COTS and component reuse across legacy systems. The program will capitalize on significant economies of scale associated with unified business benefiting maritime, surface, aviation and other TTAC programs through decreased O&M and  transaction costs. The Initial Operations Capability is anticipated in FY13 with the development of the initial service capability supporting the maritime population.  The incremental migration and disposal of legacy systems will follow the implementation of each service capability with programs transitioning to fee based programs.

EO 12472, Assignment of national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications functions, directs the NCS to seek to ensure the national telecommunications infrastructure is capable of satisfying priority telecommunications requirements under all circumstances through use of commercial, government and privately owned telecommunications resources. Currently, the Priority Telecommunications Service (PTS) provides priority communications over the commercial public switched telephone network (PSTN). However, the commercial carriers are replacing their aging circuit-switched telecommunications networks with packet-switched networks. The NGN Priority Services Program objective is to fill the missions operational gap created by the telecommunications industrys plans to replace their current circuit-switched technology with packet-switched technology. The Program acquisition strategy is designed to achieve cost-effective priority services by continuing to leverage the highly survivable, commercially-owned public telecommunications assets. When deployed, the NGN Priority Services will provide the Government with priority communications capabilities over robust and diverse nationwide communications networks at a fraction of the cost required to build a Government-owned system. The NGN Priority Services Program has been defined as a multi-year, multi-phase, and multi-increment technology initiative. This approach will allow the Program to take advantage of changes within the industry as they occur.

Private sector organizations involved in telecommunications, national security, emergency preparedness and public safety are also beneficiaries of this investment. Dependency: NGN is a technology refresh for the PTS Program.","An operational gap exists because the commercial carriers providing the public telephone systems are modernizing, eventually replacing, the current circuit-switched infrastructure with one that is packet-switched.  It is known that the four largest U.S. interexchange carriers (AT&T, Verizon Business, Sprint, and Qwest) are transitioning to IP-based networks.  As the transition occurs, the PTS Program will lose access to transitioned access segments.  The NGN priority Services Program Management Office (PMO) is working with the telecom industry to ensure that critical national security and emergency preparedness requirements continue to be met.  Transitioning priority services in parallel with industry's transition will allow the Government to avoid losing current priority capabilities due to the possible decommissioning of the circuit-switched core, or incurring increased service costs to maintain priority capabilities. Not fully funding the program would result in gradual degradation and eventual loss of current priority telecommunications.

024-000004054,24,Department of Homeland Security,40,United States Secret Service,"The USSS relies heavily on Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and communications systems to achieve its protective and investigative missions. USSS generated a classified Mission Needs Statement (MNS) for Information Integration and Transformation (IIT) that identified existing deficiencies and disparities in the USSS IT infrastructure, database architecture, cyber security, communications, cross domain application multi-level security, access control, investigative technologies, information assurance, and resource management capabilities.  At present, the USSS IT networks, data systems, applications, and system security do not fully meet basic operational requirements. The dated infrastructure lacks the ability to support newer technologies (e.g., internet protocol, IPv6), share common DHS enterprise services, or migrate to approved data centers. The IIT MNS indicates the need for a comprehensive modernization of the USSS IT Infrastructure and communications systems to close the identified technology gaps. This modernization will be implemented by means of an extensive re-architecting of the current infrastructure and the careful selection and integration of interoperable capabilities based on USSS core functions and priorities. The USSS will develop interrelated capability segments to address the identified technology gaps.  These inter-related capabilities support the delivery of essential functionalities in logical groupings based on critical mission needs and interdependencies.  The Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) program consists of Enabling, Communications, and Control capabilities, as well as cross-cutting Mission Support capabilities. At the time of this submission, the IIT Enabling Capabilities sector has been approved by DHS USM to enter the Obtain Phase of the DHS Acquisition Lifecycle Framework (ALF).  Beginning with the FY12 submission, previous IT investments that were contained in other OMB exhibits (IT Modernization, Database Architecture and WHCA Interoperability) investments were incorporated into IITT projects within the various capability areas described above.  BY12 will be the first year of acquisition of Enabling, Communications, and Control capabilities, laying the foundation for the longer term modernization effort.  As all IT systems and applications reside on, and are dependent upon, the USSS IT infrastructure, this modernization effort will provide service-wide benefit.","At present, the USSS IT networks, data systems, applications, and system security do not fully meet operational requirements and legislative mandates.  In particular, some of the applications key to supporting the USSS missions operate on a dated network system with a degraded performance reliability rating.  The network infrastructure consists of a 1980s IBM mainframe that needs security improvements, is beyond equipment lifecycle and at risk of failing.  The dated infrastructure is unable to support newer technologies (e.g., internet protocol, IPv6), share common DHS enterprise services, or migrate to data centers.   The USSS has identified IT capability gaps associated with three key areas:  network security, information sharing and situational awareness, and operational communications.  A 2008 audit identified network and IT system vulnerabilities that need immediate remediation to protect USSS systems and electronic information from illicit intercepts and exploitation. The USSS requires a significant IT modernization effort with sustained investment of resources to replace dated and restrictive network and communications capabilities. The Information Integration and Transformation (IIT) Mission Needs Statement (MNS) (a classified document) identifies the technology gaps preventing the efficient execution of USSS missions and use of DHS IT enterprise services without modernization.  Without adequate funding, these technology gaps will remain, degrading the USSS ability to perform its vital mission. IIT supports departmental and USSS strategic goals and objectives:  DHS Strategic Plan: Protect Critical Infrastructure;  DHS IT Strategic Plan: Optimize IT infrastructure that leverages enterprise capabilities and services; Strengthen cyber security to enable an effective, safe environment for carrying out the DHS missions; USSS Strategic Plan: Foster development, acquisition and deployment of cutting-edge advances in science and technology; USSS IT Strategic Plan: Optimize IT infrastructure that leverages enterprise capabilities and services.","Contracts were awarded to study the current mainframe requirements and to determine network and database architectures. Planning for migration of systems, information and applications to data centers was initiated including a discovery effort to be conducted by the DHS Data Center manager. DHS approved the IIT Enabling Capabilities program to commence the Obtain Phase of the DHS Acquisition Lifecycle Framework.  Stabilization commenced procurement of items needed to sustain the current IT infrastructure. This effort continues through FY 2012 for deliveries and installation, and provides replacement of end-of-life components and permits uninterrupted systems operations through the critical campaign period.

024-000005670,24,Department of Homeland Security,45,Transportation Security Administration,"After the attacks on September 11, 2001, the TSA was given the mission to strengthen air cargo security.  TSA implemented a layered approach that established security measures throughout the air cargo supply chain, minimizing disruptions to the flow of commerce and preventing individual vulnerabilities from becoming single points of failure.  The Air Cargo Security investment supports the systems that enable TSA to:'' Regulate activities of Air Carriers (ACs) and Indirect Air Carriers (IACs)'' Regulate and approve companies to conduct screening operations '' Determine the identity, validity and risk of companies shipping goods on passenger ''The investment consists of three operational systems and one planned system.  The operational systems include the Indirect Air Carrier Management System (IACMS), Known Shipper Management System (KSMS), and Freight Assessment System (FAS). TSA uses IACMS to manage the certification and renewal process of IACs, who arrange for cargo to be transported by air, and enables both IACs and ACs to submit Security Threat Assessments (STAs) for their employees as required by the 9/11 Act.  KSMS allows IACs and ACs to submit shippers for vetting; only cargo from vetted shippers (known shippers) is allowed to travel on a passenger aircraft. The FAS allows Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) facilities and ACs to report the amount of cargo screened on a monthly basis.  This allows certified cargo screening facilities (CCSFs) and ACs to remain compliant with the 100% Screening Mandate and for the TSA to generate congressionally mandated reports. TSA is developing the Air Cargo Data Management System (ACDMS), which will manage the application process for facilities to apply to become a CCSF.  The system will allow CCSFs to submit STAs for their employees and agents, and enable TSA to manage the certification/renewal processes.''This investment is dependent upon the TSA Operating Platform (TOP) and Transportation Worker Identification and Credentialing (TWIC) investments. All of the Air Cargo IT systems reside on the TOP, which must be operational for industry and TSA to use the systems. The TWIC program adjudicates submitted STAs and returns them as passed or denied. Only individuals with a passed STA may have unescorted access to cargo. The primary beneficiaries within TSA are the CCSP Office, Inspectors, and Air Cargo Regional Coordinators.  The primary beneficiaries in industry are IACs, ACs, and Agents''.","The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), P.L. 107-71, and the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act), P.L. 110-53, defined the air cargo security landscape.  The ATSA (passed in 2001) stipulated that a system must be in operation to screen, inspect, or ensure the security of all cargo transported in all-cargo aircraft as soon as practicable.  The 9/11 Act mandated that a system be in place to screen 100% of cargo transported on passenger aircraft within three years of the date of enactment (and 50% be screened within 18 months).  This law defined screening as a physical examination or non-intrusive method of assessing whether cargo poses a threat to transportation security.  Screening methods include x-ray, explosive trace detection, explosive detection systems, and TSA-certified canine teams.  Additional methods include manifest verification, verifying the identity of a shipper of cargo, and reviewing the contents of cargo.In order to meet these mandates, the Air Cargo Program Office adopted a layered approach to security, consisting of vetting (companies and people), screening, risk assessment, and compliance.  The investment closes the performance gap by developing and maintaining the IT systems that facilitate the various components of the layered approach, including the Known Shipper Program, processing of Security Threat Assessments (STAs), and the Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP).If this investment is not fully funded, ACs, IACs and CCSFs will not be able to obtain Security Threat Assessments (STAs) for new employees, making it impossible to continue to move cargo on passenger aircraft and difficult to move cargo via all-cargo aircraft.  Additionally, ACs and IACs would not be able to vet shippers using KSMS.  Both of these activities are required by 49 CFR Parts 1544, 1546, 1548, and 1549.  Unless a shipper has been vetted and approved by TSA, their cargo may not be shipped on passenger aircraft.  Finally, if the investment were not fully funded, ACs, IACs, and CCSFs would not be able to submit cargo screening reports to TSA, to demonstrate compliance with the 100% screen mandate.   In short, if the investment is not funded, cargo would not be transported on passenger planes.  This would create severe disruptions to the flow of commerce, significant financial losses for ACs, and ruinous losses for IACs.","KSMS accomplishments:* The Program deployed the automated appeals process.  This allows indirect air carriers and air carriers to electronically appeal a shipper record if their initial submission is returned unknown.  The new appeal process takes an average of seven to ten days.  (The previous appeal process was manual and took 60+ days.) IACMS accomplishments:*Deployed 2.2.1, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 which fixed existing problems, usability issues, and security concerns.  FAS accomplishments:* The Program launched the Cargo Reporting Tool (CRT) to indirect air carriers and air carriers.  This functionality allows these entities to submit their monthly cargo screening data directly into the tool, instead of emailing it to the CCSP email inbox. ACDMS accomplishments:* The Program completed the development of module one (out of three modules).","KSMS accomplishments:* The Program plans to launch web services to large KSMS users.  This functionality will allow industry users to vet shippers in their corporate systems automatically, without having to submit shippers individually or in batches.* Deploy enhancements to the shipper matching process to improve the matching process.* Deploy further automation to the known shipper appeals process to provide more IACs with more specific reasons for a denied appeal and speed up the appeals process.IACMS accomplishments:* The Program plans to complete a code refresh of the first IACMS module.* Address remaining high-priority usability issues.FAS accomplishments:* The Program plans to deploy a limited capability of the risk modules to selected all-cargo carriers.ACDMS accomplishments:* The Program will complete the development, testing, and deployment of all three ACDMS modules.  Once fully deployed,  ACDMS will allow facilities to apply to become part of the CCSP, submit STAs for employees with unescorted access to cargo, submit monthly their monthly screening data, and submit renewal requests.

This is due to the small size of the individual task orders (less than 1.5M), and the short duration (typically 4 months) of projects against which earned value would be measured.  The program works to reduce development and contract risk in a variety of ways, such as by using fixed-price contracts and limiting release duration for IT systems development.  The program has significantly reduced development risk by limiting the duration of system releases to six months or fewer, with the typical duration being only four months.  Additionally, the program limits contract risk on development contracts through strong project management reporting requirements, strict schedule management, burn rate analysis, stakeholder feedback, and other project management tools.  For future contracts, the program will work with the contracting officer to determine whether EVM should be included as a contract requirement or if other tools such as performance-based contracting, or firm-fixed price contracting are sufficient to ensure contractor accountability and limit government risk.  For example, the program will work with the OASIS and OASIS II contracting officers, the task order contracting officer, OIT, and Office of Acquisitions personnel to determine if contractual EVM requirements should be applied to the individual development work task orders issued under these contracts, or whether alternatives such as fixed price contracting or performance-based contracting are sufficient to limit government risk to an acceptable level.",5,"The Air Cargo System (ACS) is responsible for ensuring the security of all modes of transportation, including cargo placed onboard airplanes particularly focusing on passenger carrying planes.

025-000004480,25,Department of Housing and Urban Development,0,Department of Housing and Urban Development,"Grants Mgmt Investment, under the 25-point plan, consists of Shared Services and automated systems to manage the grants lifecycle (pre-award, award, post-award stages) of over 50 formula and competitive programs across multiple HUD Offices totaling over $47 Billion. The long-term goal is to simplify, streamline and integrate the administrative and financial processes of applying for and operating grant programs. This will be achieved through consolidating Stove-Piped Systems and leveraging Shared components, resulting in reduced grantee paperwork/administrative burden, 25% faster awards to get funds on the ground faster, greater grantee capacity to achieve results and better outcomes for citizens. Cities, counties, states and non-profits are struggling and need HUD's grants more than ever. HUD's grantees are direct agents for improving high-poverty neighborhoods, creating affordable housing, generating jobs and providing more targeted services to low-income families, the homeless, HIV/AIDS patients, the unemployed and those suffering through foreclosure. The investment will remove obstacles across HUD so grantees can re-direct staff time currently spent on paperwork towards greater productivity. The O&amp;M costs cover steady-state operation of HUD's current grants management systems across the grants lifecycle: GIMS2, E-SNAPS (pre-award intake, review, scoring, review, award); IDIS, DRGR (post-award activity setup, drawdown, reporting); and GMP, PERMS (Monitoring). Grants Mgmt also has a central Project Management Office (PMO) supporting integration planning. Transformation DME projects (HEARTH Act / eGrants Business Portal) began in FY11 and will continue through FY13. These funds will reduce costs by retiring obsolete technology (GMP Legacy), reducing redundancy (merge IDIS and DRGR creating single point-of-entry) and lowering infrastructure costs. The investment will also leverage existing services to roll in non-CPD grant programs (Healthy Homes, FHIP, etc.) enabling retirement of paper-based processes and legacy stove-piped systems for additional cost savings in FY14. Key benefits are new modules/services to address legislative mandates (HEARTH, Emergency Solutions Grant, Consolidated Plan, Lead-Based Paint, etc.), reduced HUD staff time reviewing paper, automation of additional paper-based grants, reducing administrative burden on grantees, reducing redundant reporting, faster NOFAs, enabling single-sign-on and getting dollars on the ground faster.","HUD has substantial performance gaps: grant management is inconsistent, inefficient, burdensome and too expensive. HUD administers grants through semi-automated and manual processes; using COTS, custom software and paper. Portions of the grants lifecycle are automated and efficient but not fully utilized across HUD's approx 50 programs. HUD spends too much time and money on non-integrated solutions that are taxing on grantees, require too much paper and extend time to award. Current capabilities do not effectively manage 25,000+ active grants totaling $47 billion. The main objectives of Grants Mgmt are 1)modernize/integrate existing systems through SOA and 2)get more value by centralizing more grant programs into existing Shared Services. Grants Mgmt will shut down Stove-Piped, legacy and/or paper-based manual processes/systems for more efficient administration, faster awards and significantly lower burden on grantees. Transformation IT funds are being used to address both objectives: 1)merge 2 post-award systems into on, modernize/integrate Legacy GMP, centralize databases and 2)enable 5-10 additional grant programs to move off legacy tools and/or paper into IDIS/DRGR. Efforts also underway: consolidate Grants contracts (multiple help desks and PMO) and migrate 2 GIS mapping systems to HUD-wide GEOSPATIAL investment for better integration and lower cost. This directly supports HUD Strategic Goal 4a)Catalyze economic development and job creation while enhancing/preserving community assets. If we free grantee staff of redundant/cumbersome paperwork, grantees will have more capacity to execute activities and improve neighborhoods. Grants Mgmt also directly supports HUD Strategic Goal 2a)End homelessness and substantially reduce severe housing needs. Grants service (eSNAPS) has streamlined the Continuum of Care HEARTH process, reduced time-to-award by 60% and freed homeless shelters from onerous paper reporting requirements. Grants Mgmt also directly supports HUD Strategic Goal 5c) Bureaucracy Busting, flexible modern systems and rules. Services (GIMS2 and eLogic Model) enable rapid turn-around of NOFAs with electronic intake, distribution and scoring of grant applications with minimal paperwork to make awards faster and hold grantees accountable for demonstrating results. If Grants Mgmt is not fully funded, a shutdown of shared services would result in inefficient and unaccountable paper processes. Non-IT costs would incur 4 times the cost of modernization.","Accomplished PY: FY11Consolidated eGrants Functional Requirements Document for OMB submissionPrepared recommendations on Modernization StrategyPerformed Alternatives Analysis and recommended Service Oriented Architecture implementationPrepared Needs Statement for overarching investment eGrants, supporting enterprise wide integration of all Grants Management Systems under SOA architectureHosted GIMS II System as Separate Instance for greater efficiency and improved performance and user load.

The investment provides the underlying IT infrastructure to support HUD's 12,000 employees and support contractors and host over 200 business applications.  It provides enterprise-wide services support to HUD Headquarters and 83 field offices, encompassing approximately 12,000 workstations. This investment provides HUD with modernized enterprise-wide IT infrastructure services through the HUD Information Technology Services (HITS) contract.    The departmental infrastructure investment also supports the Assistive Technology program which provides equipment, testing, installation, maintenance and training for disabled employees requiring special IT accommodations.  It also supports the IT Infrastructure Independent Verification and Validation project which provides oversight of daily operations of the IT infrastructure contracts and ensures that the Department receives the services and projected service levels as defined in each IT contract to ensure HUD's customer satisfaction expectations are met.    HITS provide a firm fixed-price, performance-based solution for enterprise-wide IT infrastructure service delivery which allows HUD to continue to refresh its IT infrastructure through initiatives that are within the fixed price contract baseline.      HITS has allowed us to achieve many important benefits, including a full modernization of the IT infrastructure, improved quality of services, incentive/disincentive based SLAs measuring service delivery performance across the full range of IT infrastructure services, increased user satisfaction, and cost escalation controls.  The infrastructure investment is leveraged to support and promote established federal electronic stewardship and data center regulations and guidance and align with e-Government initiatives.     The HITS contract is targeted for re-competition in FY 2012 based on current acquisition planning and strategy efforts underway.  The FY11 IT infrastructure budget currently includes $2 million to support transition efforts from the current HITS contract to the follow-on contract(s) known collectively as HUDNET. The fiscal year 2012 IT Infrastructure budget includes $27 million to initiate a phased transition to HUDNet.","IT Infrastructure supports HUD's Strategic Goal 5: Transform the Way HUD Does Business.

These systems support various functional areas such as payroll, staffing, processing, time and attendance, security and learning. These multiple systems provide the support to sustain the workforce necessary to achieve strategic goals, objectives and agency missions. HUDs existing HR environment faces significant execution challenges in its fundamental value chain of acquiring, sustaining, and separating the workforce. The HR End-to-End (HR E2E) Solution Initiative was established to provide an automated one-stop-shop for all human capital management services from the beginning of the HR Lifecycle, acquiring a new employee, until the end of the lifecycle when the employee departs from the Department. To realize this vision, the plan is to integrate the disparate systems that currently provide existing services (replacing some, where needed) and automate the remaining manual processes.  This solution will provide a fully integrated, state of the art Human Capital management services, leveraged by seamless automation, covering all aspect of the HR lifecycle (staff acquisition, performance/case/talent/separation mgt). HR E2E is critical to accomplishing HUDs Strategic Plan, Goal 5: Transform the Way HUD Does Business in the core HR functions associated with hiring, performance management and employee/management satisfaction with training.HUDs HR E2E solution will improve tracking and reporting capabilities for both HR and our customers. This will lead to improved customer satisfaction, better workflow management, and ultimately faster and more accurate service delivery. Measurable business benefits have been identified for each project to include (but not limited to): reducing the hiring time to less than 79 days; improve data processing accuracy/quality to over 90%; increase performance reviews completed on time to 75%; increase employees training needs assessed by 8%; increase communication delivery; and increase the number of employees leaving that responds to the Exit Survey to 90%. Analysis has been completed for two of the five projects and it is estimated that the full implementation of these projects will result in a cost savings/avoidance in the amount of $549 million over ten years.OCFO/ODEEO systems are dependent on employee data from HRAS.","The existing HR environment faces significant execution challenges in its fundamental value chain of acquiring, sustaining,  separating HUD s workforce.  These challenges include, among others: Multiple, competing workflows for executing core processes; High workforce turnover within HR; Data integrity issues resulting from both inconsistent/incorrect use of systems as well as technical issues with synchronizing data between the major systems that support the process; A proliferation of stand-alone IT systems to fill reporting & other requirements that the enterprise HR solution cannot accommodate;  A demanding customer base within HUD that needs significant help in managing, maintaining & growing a 21st century workforce to fulfill core business missions.In addition to the specific benefits provided by each individual projects, the HR End-to-End Initiative will provide the following:  Improved HR management decision-making with flexible performance metrics & reporting:  Identification, selection, collection, near real-time presentation of key outcome measures to improve management decision-making and overall organizational response times; Enabling lifecycle tracking and management of transaction workflows:  Implementation of a fully managed lifecycle view for all personnel action requests and other key HR transactions to ensure each request is tracked  and monitored from initiation to completion, with appropriate alerts and notifications for incomplete, late, or failed transactions.

Data are processed at near real-time rates or faster to support NASA's field campaigns that require processed scientific products in near real-time to coincide with the measurements of field-deployed assets; to support benchmarking near real-time applications with operational agencies such as NOAA (weather models), DoD (field conditions), and DoI (forest fire information); and to support processing into higher level, discipline unique scientific products, archived for future use without building a processing backlog. Unique scientific products generated by EOSDIS need to be periodically reprocessed due to changes in instrument characteristics and improvements to scientific algorithms. This involves reprocessing the entire missions' data within short periods of time, requiring systems that must operate many times faster than real-time rates. This system  provides discipline unique tools, search capabilities and sub-setting capabilities built around the specific science, e.g., land processes, snow and ice, atmospheric composition, physical oceanography and geodesy.The majority of the EOSDIS software is custom code, utilizing unique algorithms to accommodate the different instrumentation and science disciplines.

The Unified NASA Information Technology Services (UNITeS) contract was a full and open competition IT Services contract which includes the hardware and software refresh for the Agency's consolidated data center. Costs are generated through the competitively sourced service rates. IT refresh procurements follow the FAR. Hardware and software refresh is replacement-in-kind through competitive bid. Competitive bids take place for all refresh requirements, supplanting the need for constant, full-blown alternative analysis. A larger Agency Acquisition Strategy has been implemented that supports the data center consolidation and modernization efforts that requires upgraded or new hardware, software, communications equipment; facility improvements; and physical, personnel, and information systems security improvements. Earned Value was tracked and managed for that consolidation and modernization effort. However, due to the predominance of Steady State Operations of the NASA Data Center, Earned Value requirements have been waived. At the time the contract was established in 2004, the NASA Data Center was already a Steady State fee-for-service Investment in which EVM is not required. In lieu of Earned Value, the NASA Data Center uses detailed spending plans that reflect all projected Data Center costs including (1) Capital Investments, (2) TDY Travel and Relocation, (3) Equipment Transportation, (4) Software Licenses, (5) Human Resource Implementation Costs, (6) Communications Costs, (7) Facility Improvements, and (8) Disaster Recovery. Also, the NASA Data Center is managed through a Fee-for-Service Structure, utilizing a chargeback structure that includes all new customers. This fee-for-service structure tracks system usage, monitors operational costs, establishes service rates, and bills users. While major Agency consolidation efforts have already taken place, the NASA Data Center continues to employ optimization techniques that encompass the design and implementation activities for maintaining an optimal Agency-Wide processing configuration. This process continually identifies ways to optimize Data Center operations through standardization of operating systems, database management systems, programming languages, and off-the-shelf software; modernization, including technology insertions and communications and hardware upgrades; automation; and re-engineering.",5,This investment is well managed and in good health.

It provides unique application services designed specifically for International Space Station (ISS) crew and flight controller training. ISS training is mandatory before and during flight. The SSTF enables the capabilities to accomplish this mandatory training. It consists of a set of simulators, each designed to focus on specific types of training.      The SSTF consists of fully and partially integrated simulators. The fully integrated simulator, Full Task Trainer (FTT) is capable of three simultaneous, independent simulation sessions. It is composed of ISS module mockups and high fidelity simulation applications. The U.S. modules/systems are integrated with the International Partner-provided Russian Segment Trainer (RST), the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Systems Trainer (JST), and Columbus Trainer - U.S. (COL-TRU). The FTT utilizes actual ISS flight software and flight-equivalent hardware. The FTT also supports Mission Control Center testing and ISS procedure verification.       The Part Task Trainers (PTTs) provide training for crew and flight controllers with focus on a single vehicle system at a time. The PTTs support limited integration of avionics and system resources (e.g., command and data management, power and thermal conditioning). Each PTT is composed of a student station, instructor station, simulation computer, and realistic user interfaces. The PTT utilizes functionally simulated flight software and specially designed scripts to present a lesson to the student. PTT simulation fidelity is sufficient to support procedure development and analysis, in addition to training.     This investment is scheduled for retirement in FY15 when its capabilities will be integrated into the new Training System for the 21st Century (TS21) investment.    The primary beneficiaries of this investment are the ISS program and International Partners.     The SSTF is dependent upon the Mission Control Center for integrated training simulations.  It is also dependent upon the Software Development Integration Laboratory (SDIL) investment which provides information on the ISS flight software products that SSTF uses in its training loads.    Mr. Macha has overall PM responsibility for the SSTF under the Facilities Development and Operations Contract (FDOC).","The SSTF does not address a specific performance gap but instead provides a required function: cost effective training for ISS flight controllers and crew.  The SSTF provides various forms of training media including the capability for single systems training scenarios, multi-systems scenarios and integrated scenarios with the Mission Control Center, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the International Partners not available via other sources.  Lack of funding would prevent the development of new training scenarios needed to prepare the crew and flight controllers for new and upcoming activities aboard the ISS.  It would also prevent system maintenance which could lead to system failure resulting in degraded or lack of training for crews and controllers.  Insufficient training increases the possibility of human error which could result in loss of life and vehicle.","During FY12, the SSTF successfully conducted over 400 simulations, including standalone training scenarios and training scenarios integrated with the MCC.  Modifications implemented during the year include upgrades to the FCPTT Fire Detection and Cabin Air Fan Systems Real Flight software.

027-999991219,27,Office of Personnel Management,0,Office of Personnel Management,"The EHRI Program is an e-Government initiative designed to leverage the benefits of information technology as required by the E-Government Act of 2002. The Program supports the strategic management of human capital by providing agency customers with access to timely and accurate federal workforce data. In support of this objective, EHRI has the following goals: (1) streamline and automate the exchange of federal employee human resources (HR) information Governmentwide; (2) provide comprehensive knowledge management and workforce analysis, forecasting, and reporting across the Executive Branch; (3) maximize cost savings captured through automation; and (4) enhance retirement processing throughout the Executive Branch. The electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) is a web-based application that is capable of storing, processing, and displaying the OPFs of all current, separated, and retired Federal Employees. The system will replace the existing manual HR process by automating the Federal Government HR processes and thereby creating a streamlined Federal HR system for all Federal Employees. When fully implemented, the eOPF will cover the entire Executive Branch with a total user population of more than 1.9M. The eOPF system is offered through a fee-for-service arrangement with implementing agencies. EHRI also offers a suite of Analytic Tools to customers on a fee-for-service basis, enabling agencies to perform workforce analyses and forecasting on more than 1.9M federal employees. Both eOPF and the Analytic Tools enable agencies to hire and retain the best, supporting the OPM strategic goal to &quot;Ensure the Federal workforce and its leaders have the tools, systems, and resources to perform at the highest levels to achieve superior results.&quot; The eOPF also supports the OPM strategic goal to &quot;Provide the training, benefits, and work-life balance necessary for federal employees to succeed, prosper, and advance in their careers&quot; by enabling employees to verify benefits information, improving employee satisfaction. The primary beneficiaries of this investment are (1) current and former Federal employees who depend on employee records for employee eligibility, benefits, and other HR actions; (2) managerial and supervisory employees who require limited access to employee data; (3) Agency HR functional specialists whose duties and responsibilities require access to HR data on employees. EHRI relies on the CBIS and EIO investments.","This investment enables OPM to offer the following products and services to Government Agencies, closing identified agency performance gaps:-Governmentwide e-exchange. EHRI has developed an eOPF that can be accessed and exchanged among Federal Agencies.-Streamlined retirement processing. Retirement adjudicator access to eOPF permits access to information which formerly had to be requested from the Agency.-24/7 employee access to records. All employees will now be able to view their eOPF online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to ensure data accuracy.-Streamlined clearance process. EHRI supports the Federal employee clearance process by enabling centralized employee record checks and supporting a more efficient clearance process.Under a fee-for-service funding model, customer agencies pay for the services received. Therefore, funding reductions at customer agencies could mean reduced levels of help desk coverage for Federal employees who use eOPF and/or reduced support to agencies by the Northrop Grumman Production Support team. The inability of the customers of an agency to pay for annual license maintenance could result in the shutdown of its agency eOPF instance, meaning federal employees or HR Specialists would no longer have access to the system to view eOPFs.It is important to note that the current FY 2012 baseline is based on anticipated funding for projects that may or may not occur and it is inappropriate to establish milestones for projects that have not been funded by customer agencies. Milestones will be added to the baseline as customer agencies fund projects. Additionally, several activities are currently on hold pending the OPM financial system coming back online so that awards can be made to the software vendor. Specifically, pending activities include the eOPF Assessment Phase for Air Force, DFAS, National Guard, and Navy. Once the OPM financial system is back online in FY 2012 and awards can be made to the vendor, EHRI will add these milestones to the baseline. Upon completion of the eOPF Assessments for these DoD components, eOPF Implementation Phase activities will be added as milestones to the baseline.","EHRI expects to achieve a total of more than 1.6M cumulative HR folders on the eOPF system by year-end FY 2011. The program now has more than 80 Agencies on the eOPF system, with additional Agencies currently being implemented. In addition, EHRI received funding from the DoD to begin eOPF Assessment for all DoD components. A kickoff meeting was held in August 2011.  The Assessment Phase for these components cannot be scheduled until the OPM financial system comes online in October 2011. In FY 2011, EHRI also successfully rolled out the eOPF transfer capability to Agencies, a significant accomplishment and one that was anxiously anticipated by the Agencies. As of July 2011, nearly 23,000 electronic folders had been transferred to the National Personnel Records Center and nearly 3,000 electronic folders had been transferred between Agencies. Lastly, EHRI completed the ePerformance module for the Bureau of Prisons, a web-based performance evaluation system that works in tandem with eOPF.","With more than 80 percent of the Executive Branch using the eOPF system, it is important for EHRI to continue its rollout of the eOPF application to remaining agencies in FY 2012 in order to maximize cost efficiencies captured through automation and to achieve the mandate from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandate to bring all agencies online by December 31, 2013. In order to achieve this goal, in FY 2012 and FY 2013 EHRI will continue moving forward with eOPF assessments, deployments, and folder conversions. The largest agency eOPF deployment to date for the Department of Defense (more than 600,000 civilian employees) kicked off in July 2011 and will continue throughout FY 2012 and FY 2013. EHRI will also continue to provide eOPF hosting services and the analytical tools product offering.

Additionally, GFIS did not properly capture certain financial information and could not be properly configured to produce useful financial reports that provided accurate information regarding intra-governmental activities and balances.  The CBIS solution leverages and implements Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) certified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology to address regulatory and compliance deficiencies.

On August 27, 2004, the President issued a Homeland Security Presidential Directive calling for a mandatory, government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the federal government to its employees and federal contractors. The implementation of this Standard will ensure the identification for government employees and contractors is reliable and secure. The establishment of the PIV credential as part of a broader well managed enterprise solution enables common service capabilities in secure and reliable transactions. Further, it expedites SBAs ability to enable IT solutions that directly address line of business needs for disaster response, automated small business services such as electronic (and paperless) workflow services, and reduction in other existing investments for help desk operations and password management. E-Authentication falls within the scope of Identity and Access Management. This initiative expands e-Government by providing users access to online services that require authentication, using a solution that is secure as well as convenient and easy for customers, resulting in an improvement in the taxpayer experience. Through minimizing the burden on America's small businesses, the general public, and government partners, this initiative eliminates the need for separate processes for verification of identity and validation of electronic signatures. The IAM initiative provides a robust, highly secure, easy to manage centralized solution that automates the provisioning and deprovisioning of user identities mapped and managed to individual/entities, and manages each aspect of the identity lifecycle. By automating services, and doing so in accordance with well defined rules and role determination, SBA simplifies the independent management frameworks currently instituted individually by each application. As part of implementing security solutions at the individual application level, SBA addresses security risks on an individual basis, does not take advantage of economies of scale, and institutes varying levels of security, cost, and schedule risk across each program. This initiative will provide a security and operations focus on the management of common security services that are managed with industry proven solutions and solutions that adhere to well defined industry and federal standards.","This investment closes in whole the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 as well as OMB Memorandum 11-11: Continued Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12-Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors.

While state-of-the-art when designed, the application environment now adversely impacts the SBA's ability to rapidly meet the expanding requirements of current and future business needs. The LAS includes 19 subsystems and serves as the principal data processing and data collection tool for SBA's loan servicing, loan monitoring and loan accounting processes. The core of this investment is a 20 year old set of COBOL mainframe applications. This investment has been revised to support the agency's loan modernization efforts. The revised LAS includes the following incremental projects: Incremental migration of user interfaces to a Java/Cold Fusion/Oracle platform; Port batch programs to a new version of COBOL not captive to the Unisys mainframe; Document the mainframe loan environment; Conduct root cause analysis for known issues; Implement improvements resulting from the root cause analysis. Key objectives of these new projects are to facilitate more rapid response to the need to implement new loan programs and to continue the incremental modernization of the loan accounting system. SBA's loan centers and lender community are a direct beneficiary of the LAS investment. The investment directly supports originating, servicing, and liquidating a loan. This investment is dependent on the EUSS investment. The EUSS investment includes the infrastructure that LAS utilizes. The investment is a mixed state.",The investment closes an identified risk that may result in a performance gap for agency's loan system. SBA has identified that it is a risk to be on platform that is vendor dependent. SBA is taking initiatives to migrate to a platform independent environment.,"In the FY 2011, the LAS investment had several major accomplishments which supported the agency's mission. LAS successfully implemented technology to support the Jobs Act of 2010. The LAS investment has supported successful implementation of the Intermediary Lending Loan Program. While supporting the implementation of new loan programs, the LAS investment also retired functionality off the mainframe. In addition in FY 2011, SBA retired 275 COBOL TIP and batch programs which has resulted in 25% overall reduction in mainframe user transactions.","In the current and budget year, SBA plans to retire all screens off the mainframe and into existing web applications.

Successful implementation will allow Veterans, service members, and eligible dependents to continue to receive their education benefits in a timely fashion despite the increased volume in Post 9/11 GI Bill benefit claims.The Benefits 21st Century Education investment strives to ease the reentry of Veterans into civilian life by increasing awareness of, access to, and use of VA health care, benefits, and services. The system developed through this initiative provides timely and accurate decisions on education claims and continued payments at appropriate levels to enhance Veterans' and Service members' ability to achieve educational and career goals.  This investment aligns with VA strategic goals 1 and 2 and integrated objectives 1 and 3. VA Strategic Goals: 1) Improve the quality and accessibility of health care, benefits, and memorial services while optimizing value; and 2) Increase Veteran client satisfaction with health, education, training, counseling, financial, and burial benefits and services.

Thus, originally planned development for FY 2011 was deferred to FY 2012 and FY2012 was funded via reprogramming. FY 2013 funding will be necessary to maintain system operations and transition from a transformational initiative to a steady state program. If this investment is not fully funded for FY13, the GI Bill Long Term Solution will lack the necessary sustainment funds for its cloud computing environment, which is the operational infrastructure of the new system.

C&P, the largest VBA business line, depends on paper-based claims processing, with a substantive inventory and increasing backlog.  The primary software component in the Paperless Initiative is the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS). VBMS is a paperless claims processing system that replaces legacy claims processing software, implements improved standard business practices for a paperless claims work flow, provides enterprise data services for external and internal communications, and is enabled by an enterprise, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework.  The VBMS SOA-based technology platform provides VBA an enterprise set of capabilities for Enterprise Portal, Data Integration, Imaging, Forms Service, Rules Based Processing, Correspondence, Messaging, Workflow Services, and Content Management.  As an integrated investment, delivering the VBMS system will provide C&P the ability to increase handling and processing of over a million claims submitted a year and reduce inventory backlog, while continuing $3.7 billion in claims paid each month. VBMS will facilitate business line integration for automated, rules based claims processing with Education, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, Insurance, and Loan Guaranty, recognizing that some are highly automated through the VBMS SOA-based framework. This standardization of capabilities will reduce long term costs and align VBA enterprise requirements, which will align with the Office of Management and Budget requirements for integrating program acquisitions. This Major Initiative will help to improve Veterans' experience with VA by allowing them to interact using multiple communication channels through the Veterans Relationship Management effort, reducing the need to submit paper documents and providing a secure, accessible means to obtain benefits. This capability, combined with the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record, will in turn help claims decisions to be made more quickly, decreasing the time to provide Veterans their benefits.  Program success in FY12 will be determined through metrics such as national system deployment and user acceptance.  VBMS has an interdependency with the VETSNET Legacy system. Upon completion of VBMS the VETSNET interim solution will be retired.","The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides C&P benefits to nearly 4 million Veterans and beneficiaries. In 2009, VA received more than 1,000,000 claims for disability benefits and processed more than 975,000 of these claims. VA must seize the opportunity to significantly improve our benefits delivery systems. The volume of C&P rating-related claims has been steadily increasing. In 2009, for the first time, VA received over one million claims in a single year. The volume of claims received has increased from 578,773 in 2000 to 1,013,712 in 2009 (a 75% increase). Original disability compensation claims with eight or more claimed issues have increased from 21,184 in 2000 to 67,175 in 2009 (over a 200% increase). It is expected that this level of growth in the number and complexity of claims will continue. The increasing volume and complexity of claims and increasing benefit coverage has driven a processing backlog that must be eliminated. At the outset of FY 2010, the nationwide average number of days to complete rating-related claims was 161. To get and stay ahead of future system demand, VA needs to redouble efforts to ensure best-in-class execution of benefits delivery. VA must make a transformational change to provide Veterans the benefits to which they are legally entitled. The business transformation strategy is designed to leverage past successes and lessons learned to develop a business model that is less reliant on paper documents, providing flexibility across the organization to ensure that timely, high quality services are provided to Veterans and their families. VA will develop a 21st century benefits management capability, based on transparency, operating excellence, and innovations in technology. Department Performance measure: Reduction in average disability claims processing time to 125 days (claims backlog). Baseline as of the beginning of February 2010: 161; Strategic Target: 125 by 2015. If this initiative is not supported, then efforts to break the backlog of Veterans' Claims administration and VA will be unable to reduce the number of days to complete a benefit rating to 125 days. Paperless is designed to improve efficiency and expediency in claims processing and the payment of VA benefits, and that if this investment is not fully funded, Veterans will have to rely on an outdated claims processing and payment system, and payments to disabled and other eligible Veterans may be delayed.","In fiscal year 2011, VBMS deployed the first production ready software for Phase1 to one Regional Office.  Using agile development methodology, the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) delivered to the Veterans' Benefits Administration (VBA) software that would update and provide additional functionality to the claims process.  Phase 1 was completed and phase 2 was initiated in fiscal year 2011 and will continue in fiscal year 2012.  Phase 1 delivered a prototype to prove the concept of smart scanning, an electronic folder of images to replace the paper folder and web services application to establish a claim in the system.

VETSNET will provide rule-based processing for awards, facilitating the elimination of routine manual work, automating pension, and categorizing income and adjustments for Veterans.  The automated capabilities reduce development errors that result in delayed claim processing, creating cost savings by efficiently maximizing VA resources and by enabling efficient data processing and accurate payment to Veterans. VETSNET Financial Accounting System (FAS) pays out Automated GI Bill claims. VETSNET will also provide service connected compensable payouts, such as veterans receiving compensation under the Agent Orange Program.  Combat Related Service Compensation (CRSC) computations will be phased into the corporate database for new claims to determine VA and Department of Defense services payout.  VETSNET plays an important role outside of VA as well, as state agencies, such as Departments of Labor, Energy and Transportation, have a dependency on key data from the VETSNET corporate database.  VETSNET is targeted to replace the legacy Benefits Delivery Network (BDN).  BDN has passed its systems life cycle, with few remaining tools and resources available to support the system. Additionally, various material weaknesses have been identified related to BDN's lack of compliance with the government-wide Standard General Ledger, lack of an automated audit trail, and other shortcomings such as ineffective system messages supporting controls over payment errors. Program success in FY13 will be determined through metrics such as system availability and turnaround times for benefit payments.  VETSNET is an interim solution that will be replaced by Paperless therefore creating interdependency between the investments.","Since 1996, VA has focused on replacing the compensation and pension program functions within its aging Benefits Delivery Network (BDN) with VETSNET. VETSNET is a suite of applications to facilitate the administration of benefit programs and provide users with the data needed to make informed business decisions. Automated data exchanges with connecting systems to form One VA system will allow for faster retrieval of information critical to adjudicate and process benefit claims. Over the past 14 years, VA's system development efforts have resulted in substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of VETSNET applications. In April 2008, VETSNET became the core business application and payment system for compensation benefits. Because of the functionality enhancements, more than four million veterans now receive compensation and pension payments through VETSNET. VA estimates this represents 99 percent of all veterans' compensation claims and 94 percent of all veterans' pension claims. The identified performance gap is related to cases that have not converted, which involves approximately 50,000 active  dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) cases. Conversion of Chapter 31 cases (Vocational Rehab and Education) will also begin although those are older records. Some Apportionment cases (where part of the veterans benefits are paid to someone else, typically to care for a child not in the veteran's custody) as well as parents DIC (a Pension benefit) and additional miscellaneous cases where conversion couldn't be easily automated are still being paid on BDN. This is represented in a gap of 1% in comp and 6% in pension. VETSNET Currently pays more veterans and beneficiaries than BDN did at its peak, which is more than was anticipated when it was designed.There is a time savings when compared to BDN as most of the information was not entered into the system. The users had to pull paper files in order to address issues, which meant routinely taking days to respond to requests. This also meant that automated exchanges with other agencies were very limited. VETSNET added significantly more electronic information, but still has been forced to occasionally manually pull files for specific requests. Approximately 1% of beneficiaries are being paid (mostly Parents DIC) through BDN, as VETSNET is unable to handle them at this time. This performance gap will be addressed with the VR12 release scheduled for Oct , 2011 - Deployment to Production).","In FY2011 VETSNET Releases 10 and 11 provided Chapter 18 (Benefits for children of Vietnam Veterans that are born with Spina Bifida) and Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), as well as Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) benefit payments. In addition, web services enable VETSNET to pay Veterans per the Treasury Department's mandate to phase out paper payments and for all payments to be made by Electric Funds Transfer (EFT).",In 2012 the primary scope will be the application changes required to support the final conversion of Compensation and Pension (C&P) records from the Benefits Delivery Network (BDN) to the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) Corporate Database.

029-777777110,29,Department of Veterans Affairs,0,Department of Veterans Affairs,"This investment funds the VA Security Operations and the Compliance and Oversight programs. These programs protect the IT networks and its data. The Security Operations program has four major efforts, the Network and Security Operations Center (NSOC), Field Security Services (FSS), Secure VA and Business Continuity. NSOC maintains trusted enterprise internet gateway connections, monitors network traffic to detect intrusions and reports and responds to security incidents. It also provides services such as anti-virus protection, intrusion protection, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning and firewall management.  FSS directs the Information Security Officers (ISO) stationed at VA facilities. ISOs address questions on security matters, monitor the assessment work done on security controls and plans, and follow the actions to address identified problems. Secure VA uses a common set of tools to strengthen network security, provide strong network access authentication and authorization capabilities and reduce vulnerabilities. One tool provides visibility to all network devices. It is used to determine and address security vulnerabilities. A software version inventory and an information dashboard help build enterprise risk awareness, drive configuration management and allow for more effective management of vulnerabilities. Secure VA also maintains the secure medical device network access architecture. Finally, Business Continuity (BC) works with other VA Offices on the continuity of operations planning to minimize the effect on VA IT systems due to natural disasters or other incidents. The BC team prepares to respond and help VA quickly recover IT services when lost. The investment's other major program, Compliance and Oversight, includes teams that address key security concerns such as identity access management.  The Privacy team protects the data confidentiality of over 26 million Veterans records through employee training and risk assessments of IT systems. Another team defines security architecture. A risk management team defends against data breaches and addresses any incidents. Other teams meet VA Federal Information Security Management Act compliance and reporting responsibilities, provide systems certification services, audit security controls and plans and oversee the resolution of their findings. Finally, a team addresses security policy and governance, producing policy, guidance, advice and general support.","There are no official performance gaps identified for this investment which maintains the IT security programs, services and tools in support of the VA mission. The investment is not static, however. It is dynamically moving to constantly assess vulnerabilities and address them. As part of this effort, VA now maintains visibility to all the equipment on the IT network and the software versions they run. Vulnerabilities will more be efficiently identified based on known threats and risks.  It will also bring about a more rigorous adherence to application version control and security architecture configuration compliance, which will improve the Agency's IT security posture. The medical device isolation architecture effort is another dynamic aspect of the investment. It has created a virtual local area network that has removed these devices from the common network and protected them from exposure to intrusion or viral attack. Information Security is extremely important to the Federal Government. Agencies must constantly update their tools and adapt their processes to meet the ever evolving threat to Government IT systems. If the investment is not fully funded then VA will likely become more open to network intrusions, software virus attacks and the loss or damage of Veteran and employee records. It will be more difficult to maintain trusted enterprise internet gateway connections, to scan network traffic and emails for viruses or detect system intrusions and to test system security controls. Efficiencies will suffer such as the security processes that identify and repair vulnerabilities.","In FY 2011 the Office of Information Security deployed the visibility to the network servers' capability. During the year the tool that provides visibility to the desktop discovered approximately 360,000 desktop computers, 70,000 printers, 40,000 laptops and 16,000 servers in the VA environment. During the year OIS also turned on the Executive Dashboard to monitor related metrics and deployed the Cyber Scope application for OMB mandated automated FISMA reporting.  VA-NSOC protected the VA IT network by managing and monitoring the internet gateways, maintaining 100% availability of core security services, and processing over 2.5 billion messages of which almost 2 billion were blocked as being of malicious intent. The internal security services identified almost 13,000 malicious incidents and resolved over 136,000 trouble tickets.","In FY 2012 the investment plans to extend the IT network visibility capabilities to include network equipment such as key routers and switches. Information from the network visibility scans will be used to identify vulnerable systems and applications for risk evaluation and appropriate response.  The network internet gateways will be expanded and both the firewall protection and intrusion protection software will be upgraded. Medical Device Isolation Architecture will complete its next phase which is to take the existing virtual local area networks (VLAN) for medical devices and add application firewalls along with threat and intrusion detection capabilities. The VLAN would also be moved under the facility network access control system. In FY 2013 the investment plans to have a management system in place for audit resolution that will address findings from the independent evaluation of security policies, practices and procedures as required by FISMA. An increased effort for security in software assurance will identify security vulnerabilities during software development and security safeguards will be written into the new software.",209.314,194.117,172.869,213.87,2004.0,2018.0,The FY 2011 and 2012 funding levels from the FY 2012 President's Budget request and those for the FY 2013 do not show a significant change. ,The contracts and task orders listed above support on-going programs and operations.

029-555555111,29,Department of Veterans Affairs,0,Department of Veterans Affairs,"The Bar Code Expansion investment will help the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) remedy errors caused by patient misidentification or mislabeling of laboratory specimens. Patient misidentification through mislabeled specimens for the clinical laboratory, anatomic pathology and the administration of incorrect blood products have led to adverse patient events. The Bar Code Expansion-Positive Patient Identification (BCE-PPI) Project will utilize bar code scanning technology, commonly used in private sector healthcare facilities, for the administration of all blood products and for the collection of all types of laboratory specimens in VA Medical Centers. The collection of a properly labeled laboratory specimen from the correct patient is absolutely critical to ensure safe blood transfusions and accurate laboratory results. The VA National Center for Patient Safety completed a review of patient misidentification adverse events and close calls in the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) database. A total of 227 RCA cases of patient misidentification events were examined. Over 80% of reports were directly related to mislabeled specimens. Patients experienced delays in treatment for cancer and other medical conditions, repeat phlebotomy procedures, and repeat biopsies. Many patients received inaccurate pathology reports pertaining to specimens from other patients. The BCE-PPI investment will assist VA to achieve three (3) Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals intended to improve the accuracy of patient identification, eliminate transfusion errors related to patient misidentification, and improve the effectiveness of communication among caregivers.  To implement positive patient identification at the point of care, the Wireless Infrastructure (WIR) upgrades must be implemented at each facility.  The Bar Code Expansion investment also has dependencies on VistA Lab, Lab Reengineering, Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS), Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA), VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS), and Nursing Vitals. The BCE-PPI COTS systems will interface with these existing VA applications.  Without ongoing investment in BCE, our Veterans will be subjected to potential errors that will result in unnecessary or incorrect surgical procedures or unnecessary treatments such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, antibiotics, blood transfusions, cardiac catheterizations, or death.","The BCE initiative is envisioned to provide the following operational improvements: 1) increase accuracy of patient identification and tracking; 2) reduce laboratory-specimen collection errors; 3) reduce blood-transfusion errors; 4) reduce errors and decrease time spent in manual documentation of medication administrations, blood transfusions and recording of vital signs; and 5) provide caregivers (e.g. physicians, nurses, clinicians, etc.) with real-time access to up-to-date records to assist them in decision making when prescribing/administering/monitoring drugs, performing and evaluating tests, administering blood, and  providing other treatments. VHA Directive 2009-035 issued July 2009 requires all facilities have in place a mechanism to track and trend the number of mislabeled specimens arriving in laboratoryFailure to fully fund this project will hamper efforts to interface with, test and deploy the Bar Code Expansion - Positive Patient Identification (BCE-PPI) Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) solution.   The BCE-PPI Project will not be able to utilize bar code scanning technology, commonly used in private sector healthcare facilities, for the administration of all blood products and for the collection of all types of laboratory specimens in VA Medical Centers.  The mandated applications for Transfusion Verification, Specimen Collection, and Anatomic Pathology Collection would not be delivered to the field.The inability to deliver Specimen Collection and Anatomic Pathology to the field will result in the continuation of an estimated 223,482 Specimen Collection errors and 1,064 Anatomic Pathology errors annually. The cost associated with repeating the above tests would be what is estimated to be in excess of $700,000 annually. Patient misidentification through mislabeled specimens for the clinical laboratory, anatomic pathology and the administration of incorrect blood products have led to adverse patient events.  The safety and quality of care for our Veterans will be negatively affected if this project does not get carried out.","The BCE-PPI project was in a planning phase during the prior year (PY).   Subsequently, the following accomplishments were completed, laying the groundwork for national approval for the release of the BCE-PPI Ancillary Applications to 153 VA Medical facilties Milestones:          MicroTech/CareFusion Vendor Contract Awarded          Received PMAS Approval for an Active Status          Completed Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Testing          Received Interim Authority to Operate (IATO)          Completed Pilot Testing in Test Environments          Begin Regression Testing of Ancillary Applications.","  For Cy the planned accomplishments for the year include Transfer Verification interface development and pilot testing, the first phase of national deployment of Ancilliary Appllications and Transfusion Verification, and the beginning of interface development and pilot testing of Specification Verification.  The Ancillary Applications functionality includes-expanding tools available to the nurse for use with existing VistA software for medication administration, documentation of vital signs, CPRS read only on portable devices, and the capability to automatically accept vital sign measures from compatible Vital Sign Monitores/machines (GE Dinamap) through infrared (IFR) ports.

The Medical 21st Century Laboratory System Reengineering Program (LSRP) will modernize the legacy Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Laboratory application created more than 30 years ago. The solution utilizes a Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) interfaced with VistA to maintain systems integration with the more than 40 applications. The main laboratory modules provided by the COTS LIMS are General Laboratory, Microbiology, Anatomic Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics. A new graphical user interface will allow lab users to accomplish their primary business functions: specimen receiving, specimen tracking, quality control, testing, results documentation, and results verification. The new LIMS will allow the VA to address specific patient safety concerns, meet regulatory and accreditation standards, support enhanced business processes and emerging technologies as well as improve overall lab productivity towards both effective and efficient medical care of Veterans. This solution will meet emerging technology needs (e.g. Molecular Diagnostics, Synoptic Reporting), improve Data Sharing and Interoperability with DoD, Public Health Labs and reference labs; increase levels of standardization across Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service; and provide immediate support for the extensive inventory of laboratory instrumentation and bar code technology for specimen relabeling. Benefits to the veteran include increased access and exchange of lab data, improved clinical diagnostic services, faster processing and reporting of lab tests and correction of identified patient safety deficiencies.The project is dependent on VA OMB Exhibit 300 projects Medical Legacy to correct an identified Health Level 7 (used in message transmission) problem and to provide changes that allow converted Medical 21st Century - Lab sites the ability to communicate with non-converted sites & vice versa and Interagency 21st Century Veterans Interoperability to supply supporting functionality for standard Lab order catalog. The project is part of the VA and DoD joint health Information Technology (IT) initiative, Electronic Health Record (iEHR), and future enhancements will be driven by the iEHR requirements.","The new LIMS will deliver the following features that address six performance gaps within the legacy Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Lab.  1. Improved timeliness and responsiveness for serving Veterans: improvement in turnaround time for critical Laboratory tests such as reducing the Troponin Lab test turnaround time from estimated average of 66 minutes to 57 minutes and Potassium Lab test turnaround time from estimated average 162 minutes to 57 minutes.2. Efficient and quality Healthcare delivery for Veterans:  reduction in labeling errors on the of Lab anatomic pathology specimens from estimated .1% to 0% by using bar code technology at the point of collection.3. Improved standardization and accuracy in reporting: increase the percent of cancer pathology reports that meet Cancer Reporting Protocols as determined by College of American Pathologists (CAP) from less than 90% up to 98%. 4. Compliance with Standards: Increased percent of all laboratory reports that document the location where the lab test was performed from 80% to 100% to comply with Joint Commission. 5. Enhanced patient safety with integrated specimen tracking: specimen movement across local facility, another VA reference lab, external reference lab and VA community based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).6. Ability for continuous improvements in quality of care: availability of a suite of data mining and reporting tools in the new LIMS to permit the organization and review of clinical patterns of laboratory resource utilization for efficient workload management and decision making.7. Improved exchange of health care data for veterans and military personnel under the iEHR, the VA and DoD joint health IT initiative.A majority of clinical decisions are based on the laboratory results, therefore, if this investment is not fully funded, major patient safety issues will continue to exist in HealthCare delivery of Veterans.

These investments are important for population surveillance with the ultimate goal of improving care for these defined patient populations.  The Registry Program is composed of several highly visible projects that support specific registries as mandated by laws, regulations or VA mandates. These registries are used to coordinate care, track longitudinal outcomes in order to facilitate research and develop best practices. For example, the Traumatic Brain Injury Registry is used in screening for traumatic brain injuries in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans, providing comprehensive follow up evaluations to veterans with positive screens, and tracking care for these Veterans.  The Veterans' Implant Tracking and Alert System (VITAS) provides the critical ability to track Veterans with implants and alert them in the case of a recall. These and other component parts of the Registries Program area support the population-specific data needs of the enterprise and the healthcare needs of veterans, including, but not limited to Clinical Case Registries (HIV and Hep-C), Oncology Tumor Registry, Embedded Fragment Registry, and Eye Trauma Registry.  This exhibit also includes the converged registries solution which is an enterprise platform to facilitate the standardization of registries development and allow for quick reaction to new registries requests.

029-888888104,29,Department of Veterans Affairs,0,Department of Veterans Affairs,"In October 1996, the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 was enacted, which required VA to implement a priority-based enrollment system.  On March 29, 2009, the Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) v3.0 project was implemented, which re-hosted the legacy information system onto a new platform and implemented the initial HealtheVet Reengineering system of systems framework.  The system compiles military service, demographics and financial data from VA health care facilities and authoritative sources to process Veterans' applications for enrollment and support benefits determinations and shares them with VA healthcare facilities treating the Veteran.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has identified 16 major initiatives that will serve as a platform to transform VA into a 21st century organization that is people-centric, results-driven, and forward-looking. One of these major initiatives within the Office of Information & Technology (OIT), Initiative 6 - Veterans Relationship Management (VRM), will provide the capabilities required to achieve on-demand access to comprehensive VA services and benefits in a consistent, user-centric manner to enhance Veterans', their families', and their agents' self-service experience through a multi-channel customer relationship management approach. The ESR project was incorporated into VRM as a component of the VRM Member Services (MS) Workstream. The Enrollment project includes improving functionality to process Veterans' applications for enrollment, share Veterans' eligibility and enrollment data with all VA healthcare facilities involved in the Veterans' care, manage Veterans' enrollment correspondence and telephone inquiries, and support national reporting and analysis of enrollment data. The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) Legacy system handled this functionality until the ESR v3.0 project was first implemented in March 2009. Current development dependencies include InterAgency 21st Century One Vet (identity access management and customer relationship management) and InterAgency 21st Century Veterans Interoperability (data standards and repository and interagency information exchange).","The initial Enrollment System release provides the foundation for future capabilities vital to making it easier for Veterans and beneficiaries to access benefits, consolidate health benefits eligibility determinations for all VA's programs, reduce veteran and administrative staff burden and provide self-service opportunities for Veterans and beneficiaries. Planned Enrollment system enhancements are vital to the Secretary's Transformational Goals (T-21) and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) initiatives. Implementation of military service data sharing, a cornerstone of VLER, will enable VHA to seamlessly establish a veteran's eligibility for health benefits and enrollment, thus streamlining access to care. Enrollment system modifications, including enhanced enrollment business rules and new system interfaces will fulfill VA's vision of providing Veterans' a personalized health benefits package and a standards-compliant member benefits card. Enrollment system modifications will allow the VA to relieve 2 million Veterans from onerous annual enrollment updates, allowing Veterans to retain access to care and relieving administrative burden. Veterans will be able to access benefit lines by telephone, web, and kiosk. An eligibility service will enable internal and external systems access to authoritative health benefits eligibility data. Workflow will enhance verification of Veterans' self-reported income with federal tax information to confirm health care eligibility, reduce administrative processing, improve Customer Relationship Management across VA business lines, and eliminate data and processing redundancies with the reengineering of VistA.  Funding allows changes to the ESR application and ensures that the system technologies can be brought up to date to the current supported versions, reducing system risk and allowing for continued support of VRM, VLER, and other initiatives with Enrollment data dependencies.  If the full budgetary request is not provided, development support for system enhancements and defect resolution will be impacted, as will the ability to address policy and legislative changes in a timely fashion. Customer satisfaction will decrease significantly, and the systems could become non-compliant with policy and legislative changes that may not be addressed.

(Strategy 2).GOAL 3 - Objective 3b: Improve resilience and lifecycle investment in critical infrastructure.GOAL 4 - Objective 4c: Standardize business processes.In today's funding environment, no Corps operating project receives sufficient funding for all operational and maintenance requirements. In order to optimize output (mission delivery) and infrastructure lifespan, managers must be able to balance available resources (funding, workforce, equipment, tools, etc.) and risk. A CMMS provides the organizational framework to capture the operations and maintenance data required by management to make informed, effective decisions. In addition, a CMMS like FEM provides a means to store the data and use it to analyze maintenance management effectiveness (asset based maintenance analysis and labor based workload analysis). FEM also will ultimately provide essential failure information to risk based infrastructure assessment tools such as the Navigation Operational Condition Assessment (OCA) tool.In the past, ER 1130-2-303 required operating projects to develop an effective maintenance management program and to implement a robust maintenance control system. Appendix II of ER 1130-2-303 delineated a detailed maintenance control requirement. ER 1130-2-303 was superseded by ER 1130-2-500 in 1996. Although the requirement to maintain a maintenance control system was retained in the new ER, the detailed requirements of Appendix II were dropped. As a result many operating projects today do not maintain a maintenance control system that is adequate to provide the data needed by management to evaluate and improve maintenance performance. FEM provides an automated framework for the development of effective maintenance management practices. When used properly, the historical data can be used to determine maintenance trends and efficiencies and can identify problem areas with particular assets or management practices. Over time, the proper use of FEM can move an organization from a reactive, breakdown maintenance mode to a more efficient, predictive operation. If FEM is not supported and funded, the Corps' ability to improve the operations and maintenance of the Nation's water infrastructure will be negatively affected.","The FEM (Maximo) program is in the maintenance, operations and support life-cycle phaseReleased two IBM software maintenance updatesAchieved BEA 8.0 CertificationDIACAP.","CY: Move FEM to Maximo 7.x platform.

It provides structured data retrieval and reporting across USACE business lines, thereby providing USACE leadership with a more comprehensive executive level reporting capability, allowing for more informed decision making.  Benefits of the enterprise data warehouse include the ability to share information across business lines, common reporting tools which encourage standardization of both business processes as well as tools, elimination of the need for additional databases to support emergent customer requirements to establish new views of existing data based upon business lines.  It provides one source for coded and on demand analytical reporting removing the need for same in each source system.  By providing a single source for reports that have been vetted for accuracy and compliance with reporting requirements, the investment allows access to needed data without requiring data users to directly access the source systems and allows prior analysis and development work to be reused to support new requirements.  Currently there are 761 tables in the  Enterprise Data Warehouse which provide Enterprise Data Warehouse users with more reporting capabilities than are inherent within the transactional source systems.   EDW investment is dependent on the successful implementation of other USACE investments which represent the source data, such as REMIS (202-00-01-03-01-1600-00), OMBIL (202-00-01-02-01-1031-00), CEFMS (202-00-01-01-1010-00), P2 (200-00-01-02-01-1033-00) as well as other corporate investments and corporate IT infrastructure initiatives.",If not fully funded the Enterprise Data Warehouse will not be able to support to support the full spectrum of management and analysis is support of USACE operations and the USACE Campaign Plan resulting in the need for USACE business communities to rely on individual reporting solutions that do not take advantage of standard business processes or the benefits of a corporate data warehouse.,"- Integrated project management data from the USACE enterprise project management system (P2) .- Integrated corporate asset management data from the corporate facilities and equipment management system (FEM)-expanded financial management data and reporting capabilities to facilitate more detailed regional financial analysis.- expanded real estate program data and reporting capability.

202-000001020,202,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,0,Corps of Engineers.Civil Works,"ENGLink is USACE's dedicated system to supports its emergency management functions mandated under Emergency Support Function (ESF) #3 of the National Response Framework (NRF) (http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf-core.pdf). Under ESF #3, USACE is mandated to coordinate responses in Public Works and Engineering, which translates into providing potable water, ice, emergency power, temporary roofing, and debris removal in response to a disaster. ENGLink is the central technological capability USACE uses to deliver these services when the President activates the NRF.Benefits to Mission Delivery and Management Support Areas: ENGLink benefits both mission delivery and management support through increased op tempo by providing a sophisticated and robust framework for processing information and supporting the command and control of USACE elements. ENGLink allows deployed personnel and management real-time access to critical information for the delivery of water, ice, emergency power, temporary roofing, and debris removal via a single data entry point. This increases the speed of mission delivery by centralizing mission execution information for field personnel as well as management and agency liaisons. As a result of this centralization, ENGLink provides ground truth reporting to USACE management that is briefed to emergency management leadership and beyond. Primary Beneficiaries of Investment: The primary beneficiaries of this investment are citizens affected by a natural or man-made disaster. Because of ENGLink's operational capabilities, emergency responders who deploy to the scene of a national disaster use ENGLink to help them provide citizens with resources at a much faster rate than prior to ENGLink's development.Via ENGLink, emergency responders know the status of any active missions real-time and can immediately take action to resolve mission delivery issues. A prime example, emergency responders from the 249th Power Battalion rely on ENGLink to plan and manage their activities in completing generator installations at critical facilities such as hospitals and shelters. Dependencies Between this Investment and other Investments: ENGLink depends on 1) the Corps of Engineers Enterprise Information System (CEEIS) to provide its computing infrastructure, 2) P2 and CEFMS for provision of financial data, and 3) the Deployable Tactical Operating System (DTOS) as its platform-of-use during event response.","ENGLink was first implemented in 1997 to close performance gaps in the speed and efficiency of USACE's response to natural disasters. These performance gaps were driven by the normal lack of communications and management infrastructure in the wake of a natural disaster. In the absence of a system like ENGLink operating from a deployable communications platform like DTOS, USACE's emergency responders were constrained to use crude and inefficient mechanisms such as hotel fax lines, satellite telephones, and stand-alone computers to manage responses involving hundreds of millions of dollars of federally-procured resources. These constraints stemmed from the lack of communications infrastructure available in an area that has just suffered a natural disaster.ENGLink, in combination with DTOS, has closed these performance gaps and enabled an unprecedented level of efficient response to major disasters. For example, during Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the year 2005, USACE deployed DTOS vehicles with ENGLink-trained staff who used ENGLink to facilitate the installation of 193,000 temporary roofs, the delivery of 103 million liters of water and 232 million pounds of ice, the installation of 914 generators, and the removal of a total of 38,967,195 cubic yards of debris. Another performance gap addressed by ENGLink is the need for as close to 100% system availability as possible. By virtue of its operational value, ENGLink is one of the few systems in USACE that has seen an investment in a complete continuity-of-operations plan (COOP) to guarantee nearly 100% availability. Through its COOP, ENGLink can failover and operate from a data center thousands of miles away from its normal hosting location, enabling USACE to handle any emergency affecting ENGLink itself. This robust architecture has already benefited USACE through the availability of ENGLink during the rare outages affecting ENGLink's hosting data center. Program Impact if this Investment is not Fully Funded: In the absence of ENGLink, emergency responders would be forced to fall back to manual and localized methods of data entry, management, and reporting, instead of simply using ENGLink or having it modified in real-time to meet operational requirements. This would make a major emergency such as Hurricane Katrina completely unmanageable, and would cause minor responses to require significantly more people than are presently deployed.","Over the course of the previous year, the ENGLink program has brought to near fruition a major technology upgrade that was begun four years ago, termed 'ENGLink Redesign.' This upgrade, planned for release on 31 August 2011, will increase the utility and functionality of ENGLink by taking advantage of web-based technologies that were unavailable when the system was originally developed in 1998. The goals of the Redesign are to incorporate the lessons learned over the past 13 years into a streamlined framework that takes advantage of the greater functionality provided by modern web-based technologies. As part of this upgrade, the program accomplished the following objectives over this year: 1) Completion of the Deployment Module for personnel deployment to a disaster area, 2) CAC integration to meet important DoD security mandates, 3) Migration of legacy data dating from program inception in 1998 & 4) Completion of dynamic reporting, direct role management, debris module, and feedback.","This year, ENGLink will be focused on supporting the rollout of ENGLink v2.0 , as well as the development of additional capabilities. Based on USACE's practice of supplying emergency management personnel from multiple organizations as required, USACE will undertake a round of training targeting the thousands of potential users to ensure a basis of intellectual capital and understanding is built into USACE's human capital in advance of ENGLink Redesign's first major event.In terms of new capabilities, the four years of effort that have gone into the ENGLink Redesign has resulted in the identification of additional features and functionality. These advancements are targeted to be taken up under normal operations and maintenance this year, and include Accident Reporting System (Safety), Incident Reporting System (Intel), FPFRS, AAR/Lesson's Learned, Force Protection, GIS (CorpsMap Integration), and Common Operating Picture(s).",7.578983,1.407,1.859695,1.564,2005.0,2020.0,"Changes reflect costs for Civil requirements ONLY, Military funds have been excluded.",ENGLink is an Operations and Maintenance effort focused on implementing changes reported by end users.

The OMBIL Plus data warehouse merges financial, activity, inventory and output data to create performance measures of efficiency and effectiveness. OMBIL Plus directly supports and is critical to Corps programs and project management, the budget process, PART performance measurements and project investment analysis and decisions. Managers at Corps projects use OMBIL Plus to manage day-to-day functions such as lock operations and hydropower outages and generation. Civil Works relies on OMBIL Plus to provide inventory, output and performance for the Corps, Congress and OMB to evaluate performance relative to strategic goals. OMBIL is used by over 8,000 Corps employees to collect, manage, analyze, evaluate and direct activities to achieve and measure performance targets. OMBIL Plus meets the Congressional mandate to be the federal provider of navigation and water transportation information. These data are required by Customs and the IRS to assist in detecting non-reporting of taxes. DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics, USCG, TVA, DoD, Industry and the public rely on this information as the sole source of water transportation and inventory statistics. Customer satisfaction is constantly reviewed via formal user workgroups for each business area that determine modifications and priorities. Increased e-Gov collaboration is occurring with Federal and State agencies and improved industry electronic data submission via direct transmission and the web.

422-000001327,422,National Science Foundation,0,National Science Foundation,"iTRAK is a major initiative to modernize NSF's financial management capabilities with a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) core financial management solution and interfaces in a shared services environment. iTRAK will replace NSF's existing Financial Accounting System (FAS), which is becoming technically and functionally outdated by growing mission-driven business demands and regulatory requirements. NSF needs to modernize its legacy financial accounting system (FAS), which is over 20 years old and is becoming technically and functionally outdated by growing mission-driven business demands and regulatory requirements. FAS cannot provide the robust financial management functionality needed in today's business environment and required by NSF to provide more accurate and reliable financial information for both external and internal stakeholders. iTRAK will provide NSF internal customers including financial staff, administrative staff, and Program managers, with improved funds management capability, reporting capabilities, and automated business processes. iTRAK will also strengthen internal controls by providing system edit checks and audit trails for all financial transactions. Through new functional capabilities and business process automation and standardization, iTRAK will help to improve NSF's operational excellence and enable efficient, effective execution of financial activities and business operations on behalf of NSF's external customers, science and education grantees. NSF Programs and grantees will also receive better, more timely financial information to manage their portfolios more effectively. An updated analysis of alternatives conducted in 2010 to comply with OMB Memo 10-26. Alt 2, 18-Month Approach, was selected as the superior alternative, resulting in the lowest risk-adjusted lifecycle cost, the highest NPV and ROI, and the highest value score.","iTRAK modernizes NSF's current financial management environment and provides an integrated financial management and business solution by way of an SSP. iTRAK is replacing the legacy financial accounting system (FAS), which has supported NSF for over 20 years. FAS has many manual processes with a high potential for human error and duplication of effort, which jeopardizes NSF's history of clean audit opinions. Recent financial statement audits have identified findings concerning the number and amount of manual journal entries. Additionally, because FAS is built on outdated technology, upgrading FAS to comply with new Federal regulations (i.e., TIPRA, GWA, CGAC, and ARRA) will be extremely costly. A growing number of variances between current FAS functionality and the most recent OMB/FSIO requirements have also been identified. iTRAK facilitates automates labor-intensive manual business processes and complies with revised A-127 requirements mandating use of FSIO-certified COTS systems for core financials and adoption of FSIO standard government business practices and requirements, including the CGAC structure. iTRAK will enable NSF to achieve process efficiencies and economies of scale in financial management operations and the provision of timely, accurate data for decision-making. The following NSF legacy gaps have been indentified and will be closed as part of the iTRAK project: Inadequate automated processing support and controls: Increase capabilities for more information operational and programmatic decision-making, Lack of standard business processes and key functionality: Improve effectiveness and efficiency of financial and business processes, Transparency (Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act requirements) and Non-Compliant risks): Enhance Financial and business accountability, integrity, and compliance.","Prior Year Accomplishments (2011)1.

The NRC uses validated contractor-owned earned value management systems (EVMS) which gather the data of each contractor's operations to be evaluated. The level of effort will vary based on factors such as the number of control accounts and the number of tasks/activities in the schedule, for each contractor. Therefore, an incremental cost algorithm based on equivalency factors will be used to evaluate contractor's progress and compare EVM data which will be placed into designated categories and assessed by significance in accomplishing NRC goals for ISS Programs. The NRC validates contractor-owned EVMS by first conducting an initial contractor ANSI/EIA STD-748 compliance assessment with the NRC Project Managers and other stakeholders using the NDIA PMSC, ANSI/EIA-748-A Standard for EVM Systems Intent Guide. The NRC will validate the correctness of the reported data by standardizing EVM reporting requirements for all currently operating EVMS contracts to facilitate improved timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of the data that contractors submit. Those systems in Operations/Steady State phase have had operational analyses conducted and are addressed in the Cost &amp; Schedule section of this form. If and when EVM is reported outside of acceptable boundaries the NRC will maintain program manager flexibility to apply expandable techniques and schedules to improve EVM efforts. NRC will consider using EVM on cost /incentive contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements. EVMS requirements language has been added to all contracts and statements of work for new development and will be inserted to existing contracts at the time of modification, extension or exercise of option. Further, the NRC will also analyze the use of a standardized threshold for all contracts when considering the use of EVM in the future if the agency feels there is sufficient risk to warrant it. By establishing an EVM policy which focuses on dollar thresholds for contracts, revised cost performance reports, use of expanded applications of integrated master schedules and baseline reviews, the NRC will be able to manage and monitor contractor costs and schedule performances closely. This will also allow NRC to follow the percentage of time for system request changes and contractual modifications to be properly identified and rectified.",3,Steady progress is being made in resolving issues resulting from the transition.,22.0,2011-10-21

NRC uses a Federal Shared Service Provider (SSP), the National Business Center (NBC) at the Department of the Interior (DOI), as the host/provider of the NRC's core financial accounting system, FAIMIS. In addition, NBC stores the historical data from the Federal Financial System (FFS); NRC used FFS prior to FY 2011, we are required to maintain this data in accordance to National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards. FAIMIS replaced five systems: FFS, License Fee Billing System, Allowance/Allotment and Financial Plan system, Capitalized Property System and Cost Accounting System. FAIMIS went live on 10/01/2010.  In July of 2012 NRC will Re-host FAIMIS to an new SSP, CGI.  FAIMIS interfaces with RPS, BFS and T&L for reference data and payroll.The increase in project cost can be attributed to the following:-FY 2011, an increase in Operations and Maintenance (O&M) cost estimated for both software and hardware since receiving the initial cost estimate from NBC is due to additional requirements captured during the Requirements Definition and maintaining NRC on the current version of the software (7 minor releases and 1 major upgrade per 4 year period).-FY 2012, the Acquisition Module implementation was postponed from  a date in FY 2012 to FY 2014, but requirements analysis continued.-FY 2012, DOI/NBC, our SSP notified NRC of their plan to no longer support Momentum in FY 2013.

FAIMIS provides accurate and timely financial performance information to NRC staff and stakeholders to assist in the decision-making process and in the oversight of licensing and regulatory programs. This improved capability and integration increases the number of employees with access to accurate and timely financial information. It includes interfaces to employee time and labor costs systems as well as budget formulation systems which has eliminated the need to manually enter the data into two separate systems, making the data available more accurate.The License Fee Billing System (FEES) legacy system and the Cost Accounting System (CAS) were decommissioned by the end of FY 2011.

NRC's Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response (NSIR) is responsible for the effective operation of the NRC's emergency preparedness and incident response programs.  In order to carry out these critical responsibilities, NSIR Headquarters Operations Center (HOC) and Operations Officers, within the HOC, continuously (24x7) receive and document telephone notifications issued by nuclear power plant operators, fuel cycle facility operators, and others.  In order to meet its mission, Operational readiness for the HOC is supported by the four major support systems: (1) Operations Center Information Management System (OCIMS), a system that includes a range of services for data, display and voice; (2) Emergency Response Data System (ERDS), an analytical system used by NRC licensees to transmit reactor data points to the HOC for independent safety analysis; (3) Emergency Telecommunications System (ETS), the system of telephone circuits and equipment that NRC relies on during an emergency to communicate with all commercial nuclear power plants (NPPs) and major fuel cycle facilities; and (4) Secure Video Teleconferencing System (SVTC) provides a secret level video conferencing capability to perform classified face to face coordination with other government agencies.  There are no dependencies between this investment and other investments. Also note that this investment is unique in the service provided.  All the systems associated with the IRS investment are only activated if there is an event.","One of the major activities of the NRC is to maintain a program to respond to incidents involving NRC licensees, and conduct a program of emergency preparedness and response exercises for licensed nuclear facilities. Sharing information quickly among the NRC, responding with other Federal agencies, and with the nuclear industry is critical to responding promptly to any incident. The NRC staff supports several important Federal Information Collection Requests (ICRs) for inter-agency coordinated assessments of event-related information.  The NRC Headquarters Operations Center (HOC), located in the agency's headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, is staffed around the clock to disseminate information and coordinate responses. In order to support this activity, the NRC's Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response (NSIR), is responsible for the effective operation of the HOC. The HOC is staffed by two Headquarter Operations Officers (HOOs), who receive and document telephone notifications issued by NRC licensees.  Written reports of these notifications are distributed for review, and for various follow-up actions. A small number of these notifications trigger activation of the NRC Incident Response Plan, under which response teams use the facilities in the HOC, in the Regional Offices, and at the nuclear power plant sites to fulfill the NRC mission of ensuring that the public is protected. IRS's key role in supporting incident response operations is vital.  If program is not fully funded to continue contract support for operations and maintenance of the IRS investment, this would mean that IRS and its various subsystems would be operating unsupported and at risk. Should a component of the system fail, or its performance degrades for any reason, there would be no contract support services in place to resolve the issues.  If a system is not properly maintained on a daily basis, system degradation can generally be expected to begin taking place within a matter of weeks, and system failure is inevitable at some point.  The IRS's systems must be maintained in a highly operable status.  If IRS s systems  were not fully funded their performance would be degraded, and could significantly impair their ability to communicate and could jeopardize NRC mission of ensuring that the public is adequately protected.","IRS's accomplishments for FY2011 were as follows: (1) completed the transitioning of data transmission to NRC from modem to VPN at 74 out 104 licensees; (2) completed ERDS training server refresh; (3) completed technical refresh for voice conferencing, E-Library system, blade stations, HOO servers, HP scanners, printers, faxes, workstations, infrastructure servers; (4) awarded OCIMS O&amp;M new contract; and (5) completed and maintained all annual Authority to Operate (ATO) annual updates (Security Plan, Contingency Plan and quarterly scans and POA&amp;M activities).","IRS's goals for FY2012 are to complete transitioning of all Licensees (104 units) from modem to VPN, complete ERDS three years ATO renewal, and complete technical refresh for satellite antenna system, network switches and routers.

This migration is in alignment with NRC IT centralization initiative and relieve the Chief Financial Officer office of maintaining physical inventory which is out of the scope of the office's duties.  Budget Year (BY 2013)- 1st QTR - Modify main BUDGET application to include Job Code dimension.  Adding the Job Code dimension will allow all of NRC to formulate down to the same level in which they execute at.  This enhancement will eliminate office-based subsystems, further centralize the formulation process within BFS and allow a fluid level of transparency between formulation and execution data. - 1st QTR - Establish an XML ETL (Extract Transform and Load) process to automate OMB MAX reporting.  NRC will be taking advantage of OMB's open source data tools to facilitate OMB reporting requirements.  NRC will work with the OMB XML templates to convert BFS data into OMB reporting format.",3.891,0.66247,0.74695,0.56525,2008.0,2016.0,Not Applicable,"EVM is not included in the contracts due to the fact that the overall value of the contracts is low and it was determined that the overhead of EVM reporting and analysis did not provide an appropriate ROI to the government.

429-000002016,429,Nuclear Regulatory Commission,0,Nuclear Regulatory Commission,"This investment provides for the collection of time and attendance and labor data for approximately 4050 employees and consultants. The purpose of this investment is to perform a modernization of the legacy HRMS Time &amp; Labor (T&amp;L) system. An alternatives analysis of T&amp;L and subsequent business process improvement studies confirmed the critical need for a T&amp;L investment that supports human capital initiatives and that equally supports the financial and business objectives of the agency. The T&amp;L system satisfies statutory requirements for billing NRC licensees and managing costs associated with collecting fees prescribed by the OBRA-90 and Nuclear Waste Act. The information provides executives with a tool to manage human resources. The data are used for formulating and executing budgets, operations planning, workload planning, managing costs, payroll processing, and performance monitoring. The data are used in analysis and reporting on resource expenditures, and are core to the decision making processes in the agency. The T&amp;L system interfaces with agency enterprise-wide systems, including the Reactor Program System and the Strategic Workforce Planning System.  T&amp;L provides NRC with a means to meet the effective internal control objectives of the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act. NRC's major financial systems, including T&amp;L Modernization, are used to support NRC's 2 major programs of Nuclear Material and Waste Safety and Nuclear Reactor Safety.  In FY11 and FY12, a three-phased approach for redeployment is underway. The first phase focuses on a technical evaluation of the application and recommended changes as well as the construction of a rebuilt infrastructure. Phase two focuses on comprehensive testing of the functionality and performance.  Phase three focuses on conducting user acceptance testing and training. Deployment is dependent on each of these phases being completed successfully.","The modernization of the legacy HRMS T&amp;L system is a Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) system that has provided the NRC with a mechanism of securely collecting employee work hours for payroll processing.  The HRMS system also integrates with the Core Financial system for providing employee and agency costs for general ledger processing, employee detail hours by activity for FEES processing of licensee collections and for Salary and Benefits calculations.  The latest version has closed security gaps by utilizing data encryption from the client workstation to the servers as well as removing all client workstation software. The introduction of electronic workflow has eliminated all paper processing thereby strengthening the privacy of data and reducing agency costs. The updated system also puts the NRC in a position to more fully and seamlessly integrate with other NRC systems reducing the redundancy of data entry and providing more current and secure information.","Time and Labor Modernization (TLM) list of accomplishments:Prior Year (PY-2011)- New server hardware, operating system (Windows 2003 to 2008 64-bit) and database upgrade (SQL 2005 to 2008) serves as the baseline environment for the Peoplesoft 9.0 upgrade.- Web and Application server instances of the Peoplesoft 9.0 Upgrade are in a virtualized environment.- SQL Deadlocking issue upon save of time and entry forms resolved through the introduction of new SQL temporary resource tables.- Unit, Functional and Performance testing of upgrade version 9.0 has been completed.
