These milestones are: 25729, 25730 and 25738. The short explanation is that these cost variances are incorrect because prior year Planned total costs cost numbers included both IT and non-IT costs. To correct these milestones for more accurate reporting by the contractor, and as a requested by PIRWG to better specify SS and DME activities, a baseline change request was submitted in October to replace the milestones to be more measureable for IT-only SS and DME activities. We were notified on October 15, 2010 that the BCR was preliminarily approved and then on November 9, 2010 we received notification of final approval. The Exhibit 300 was updated to reflect the BCR changes in the milestones and costs on October 15. When the IT Dashboard was updated on October 27, 2010 it included the new milestones that are correct; however, it also included old milestones that were incorrect and were supposed to be deleted. Therefore, the three milestones listed above with greater than 30% variance should not appear.

The project manager is FAC/P/PM certified and has met the learning credit requirement.  The last program assessment performed scored 5 out of 5. Reasons for schedule delay on milestone 4-04-24-2010 is due to The MSIX development was completed by September 28, 2007.  However, the system did not get Certified and Accredited (C&A) by the Department of ED until November 30, 2007 because of schedule conflicts since ED was also doing C&A on the EDUCATE system at the same time.  Since EDUCATE is the Department's major infrastructure system, the MSIX project was given a lower priority and the accreditation was delayed 2 months. 11-04-24-10 milestone was delayed in completion because the Department did not pay the contractor's award fee until April 30, 2010.  The contractor expended and billed for the EVM and Financials work in a timely manner.  14-04-24-2010,15-04-24-2010, 16-04-24-2010 milestones were delayed because the Department did not pay the contractor's award fee until April 2010.   Unlike the previous milestone (11-04-24-10) , there was not a separate milestone in 2009 to specifically record the award fee.  Instead, the award fee dollars was reflected in the three task milestones.  Therefore, these three milestones were affected by the late payment by the Government of the contractor's award fee.

Implementing the Federal CIO's 25 Point Implementation Plan, the COP PMO is currently working with DHS Enterprise Architecture team to identify areas that can be integrated with other DHS systems. There are currently no open TechStat issues with the program.  Mitigation strategies are now in place and this program will continue to be monitored.  As a result of the overall actions taken, the program is positioned for successful outcome. Therefore, the CIO assesses the A&O COP program as Moderately Low Risk.","Yes","11485","163837","12:47:23"

It has continued to meet and exceed the original investment expectations and requirements. The program fully aligns with USCG mission needs and is a model HR program for DHS and other Federal agencies. The program has a documented risk management plan, and the mitigation actions are clearly incorporated into the cost and schedule plans of the program. The system has consistently operated within acceptable variances and budget. The greatest risk to the program has come from the extra cost of integrating the Public Health Services (PHS) into the system, which resulted in an increase in the summary of funding and a slight budget variance.  The integration of PHS has shifted Direct Access to a multi agency collaboration investment between USCG and Health and Human Services (HHS), as such, funding for FY12 and beyond includes both USCG and HHS values. This shift mitigates much of the budget risk to USCG by providing the extra funding for the remainder of its life cycle. Direct Access is well managed and a model for other HR management programs. As a result, the DHS OCIO assesses the program as Moderately Low Risk.","Yes","11541","163901","12:47:25"

The USCIS Transformation Program, as currently planned and managed, presents significant risk to the USCIS organization's ability to perform its mission. Proposed staffing levels and composition of the USCIS Transformation PMO: The DHS CIO found that the size of the development contractor team (over 500 staff at peak) and composition of the PMO (over-reliance on contractor PMO support rather than federal employees) represents a significant risk in effectively managing the program. Aggressiveness of the schedule was noted as significant risk by the DHS CIO. Appropriateness of the proposed technical solution: DHS CIO asked for an independent assessment of the technical solution proposed for USCIS Transformation.

"024-000003015","319","024","Department of Homeland Security","USCIS - Transformation","02/24/2011","2","The DHS CIO conducted a comprehensive program review of the USCIS - Transformation Program (TPO) on November 5, 2009.  As part of the mitigation strategy from the program review, DHS OCIO conducted an in-depth technical review in spring 2010 to ensure adequacy of the proposed solution architecture.  The program was again evaluated on July 8, 2010 during the IT Portfolio Review Initiative.  On November 29, 2010, the program was reviewed by the Acquisitoin Review Team.  In addition to these reviews, the DHS CIO attends the monthly CIS TPO Management Reviews (PMRs).  The last PMR was held on Februray 4, 2011.USCIS TPO is a major buiness and IT transformation initiative that involves fundamental reengineering of  USCIS business processes and supporting IT capabilitites, moving from the current stove-piped  business processes and out-moded legacy technologies to modernized and integrated budsiness processes and supporting IT capabilities, built around a person-centric data construct to better manage the lifecycle of non-US Citizens and their travel and interactions with the United States government.  As USCIS TPO rolls out new capabilities, legacy systems and infrastructure will be retired.  The USCIS TPO program is early in its life cycle.  The program was decelerated in June 2009 and restructured during 2010 to enable incremental validation of the program requirements, development, and testing.  Release A is currently in the design phase and is scheduled to begin production deployment during calendar year 2011.  The DHS CIO recommends the team identify a core set of functionality so the design can be completed expeditiously and moved into development.  Even with this mitigation, the DHS CIO rates the schedule risk for delivery of Release A as high.  Another major risk is acceptance of the Release A by USCIS users.  The team involved users in the requirements process and through the development of the clickable UI prototype.  Users will have the opportunity to provide feedback prior to enterprise deployment.   The DHS CIO does not recommend additional actions or change to the approach, but is concerned that acceptance issues may impact the implementation schedule.  Progress includes:  addition of program leadership, increased transparency with stakeholders, 162 Transformation information sessions held, prototypes completed, effective management of critica path activities, and building out a modular development plan.","Yes","5278","51246","15:37:57"

While significant execution risks remain in delivery of Release A, the program has made significant progress, including improvements in program leadership, team dynamics, stakeholder involvement, and management of critical path elements.  The team has completed requirements elaboration for Release A and has developed two prototypes, one to validate the user interface (UI) and one to demonstrate the soundness of the architectural solution.  Based on the DHS CIO's recommendation and the OMB 25-point plan, the program now uses a modular construction approach.  Nevertheless, the DHS CIO regards the schedule risk for Release A as high because the team's metrics regarding development (to include coding or configuration productivity rates, defect rates, and testing productivity) are based on like programs, not on the USCIS Transformation program.  The DHS CIO recommends the team identify a core set of functions for which the design can be completed expeditiously and moved into development.  Another major risk is user acceptance.  The team involved users in the requirements process and through the development of the clickable UI prototype, and will give users the opportunity to provide feedback prior to enterprise deployment; however, the DHS CIO remains concerned that user acceptance issues may impact the implementation schedule.

The benefits of this system had reduced the threat to life and property due to terrorism and increased CBP Officer/Border Patrol Agent safety. NII is a well-managed program; however the program's funding was significantly reduced due to budget cuts. The negative impacts from the budget cuts are the program will have to move to the sustainment phase, there will be a delay in purchasing replacement NII equipment that has reached end of life, and there will be no NII equipment for new or enhanced ports. CBP anticipates no impact on the deployment schedule for NII Systems that are already purchased and is assessing any alternatives to resolve the funding cuts.

They further stated that the information is sometimes difficult to access, and some of the data are unreliable.   This report recommends that,  IT systems should be considered within the context of the BOEMRE reorganization. Specifically, BOEMRE should examine whether TIMS can be upgraded to meet business requirements and address user performance concerns by leveraging more current, web based, user-friendly technologies together with existing tools already within the Department. BOEMRE should carefully consider factors such as speed, performance requirements, and cost-effectiveness.   There is a fair amount of uncertainty going forward with fulfilling the business requirements of the three (3) new organizations identified, and the specific role of this operational investment to meet them.  Due to the current reorganization underway, the following aspects of investment management are being reassessed: 1) the Risk Management Strategy, 2) the requirements, 3) the acquisition strategy.  Due to the risk associated with the current status, the CIO rating is a 3.  As the updated Risk Management Strategy, requirements and Acquisition Strategy are updated and reviewed and there is more certainty around the how this investment will benefit and service the new organizations, the CIO evaluation will be reconsidered.","Yes","4353","33326","15:34:30"

These first sites are the Houston TRACON, which uses the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), and the New York TRACON, which uses the Common Automated Radar Terminal System (CARTS).  The program also plans to implement ADS-B capability with the En-Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system at the Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) this spring.  The In-Trail Procedures (ITP) effort for trans-Pacific flights is progressing again, with an expectation that six to eight flights per month can be used for the IPT Operational Evaluation.  The majority of other ADS-B efforts continue to be on schedule. The CIO's rating of Yellow (medium risk) is due to overall schedule dependencies with ERAM and TAMR.","Yes","8700","121466","15:58:11"

The audit objectives were to (1) determine the development and implementation status of SWIM and (2) assess the risks facing SWIM's successful deployment.   A key issue dealt with a difference of $100 million between an early, pre-baseline cost estimate from 2007, and the lifecycle costs that were approved and baselined by the FAA in 2009.  Most of this increase came from increased costs for ERAM's Flight Information Service; the estimated lines of code tripled from 2007 to 2009, and the ERAM program office developed a shared cost model to allocate some of the costs of a software release to the various programs that were included in the release.  Since they did not have this shared cost model in 2007, these costs were not included in the SWIM cost estimate until 2009, when they were moved from ERAM to SWIM.

It was agreed that most of the original functional requirements still apply however, a subset have been identified for delivery. Until September, 2011, scope cost and schedule were unreliable and contentious, primarily due to missteps on the part of RITA IT.  In order to bring IAIS back on track, RITA IT and the major IAIS stakeholders, both inside and outside RITA, have agreed that there would be a revalidation of requirements in order to clearly define the remaining scope and a gap analysis of completed development vs. revalidated requirements.  A new schedule and cost estimate to complete, test and implement the redefined IAIS will be prepared by RITA IT for approval by the customers and stakeholders.  In addition to cost, schedule and scope, the gap analysis and ongoing plan will take careful consideration of risk and performance measures.  Once the customers and stakeholders approve and provide funding for the plan going forth, RITA IT will continue development, test and implementation activities.  RITA IT anticipates that the requirements analysis, gap analysis and planning will be complete by 31 December, 2011.

On April 17, 2012, FinCEN completed the work necessary to meet the bulk dissemination milestone, originally scheduled for March 1, 2012. A first set of sample data has been provided to the data recipients to begin testing efforts.  The development team completed system integration testing for the new Query system; however, this testing took two weeks longer than initially planned.  As a result, FinCEN began government acceptance and performance testing two weeks later in April than originally scheduled. FinCEN has provided a new projected milestone date of June 15th for the release of the new Query system, as opposed to the planned milestone of June 1st.  As a result of the additional time on the first release of FinCEN Query, FinCEN has not yet begun efforts on the second release, which will provide enhanced capabilities. FinCEN has a new projected start date of June 15, 2012 and does not anticipate a change in either planned cost or projected completion date.   FinCEN has begun some work on the Broker Information Exchange initiative through its collaboration with the Treasury Electronic Case Management efforts to see how FinCEN may contribute to the goal of having a Treasury case management system with common functionality; however, a task order has not yet been issued in support of any design/development efforts.","Yes","10469","148963","06:33:48"

As of the end of May, FinCEN continued regression testing the new Query system and external users performed onsite testing with a week of remote testing in early June.   The overall project costs for Query have been adjusted following the requisite contract negotiations to allow for additional testing activities. FinCEN has also adjusted the milestone to be June 30, 2012 to internal users.  The follow on deployment of FinCEN Query planned for external users will now be delayed due to a recent enhancement request by the Federal law enforcement community that will impact the design of the web application.  These enhancements will be captured under the second release of Query, and FinCEN estimates two months of design/development/testing effort after which the Query system will be deployed to all external users as an interim milestone.  As a result of these new enhancements, the project milestone date for the entirety of the second release of Query has been adjusted from October 1st to December 1st.  The upcoming milestone date for E-Filing has been adjusted from July 1st to July 31st.  In late April, FinCEN experienced delays in awarding the new E-Filing contract, which also required the E-Filing contractors to physically move onsite to FinCEN.  These delays created the schedule adjustment, but there are no cost impacts.   A risk is being monitored on the impacts of taking more time to close production data issues than expected and resource conflicts with ongoing development efforts for the second release of the updates to the system of record.","Yes","10949","156305","06:33:30"

In addition, the Authority to Operate has been signed by the FinCEN CIO.  FinCEN has updated the projected completion date to July 20th. The projected completion date for the second release of the System of Record has also been adjusted from July 1st to August 1st because the risk of balancing resources between addressing production data issues needed to support the deployment of FinCEN Query and ongoing development efforts has been realized.   The second release of E-Filing functionality is on track to meet the new projected completion date of July 31st.  FinCEN has closed the Hardware/Software milestone of June 30th because the production environment meets the performance requirements for the initial user population.

In July, FinCEN analysts began using the new FinCEN Query application via the FinCEN Portal. On July 31st, FinCEN completed the remaining work associated with the second release of E-Filing, which streamlined the filer registration process so that filers may complete the registration process immediately upon request via e-mail notification and provided self-service capabilities, such as password reset. FinCEN moved the analytical toolset, SAS, from the legacy technical platform (Sybase) to the modernized technical platform (Oracle) where analysts may now leverage the new data-centric database structure, as well as enhanced data, in support of advanced analytics, query audit log, and alerts. The projected completion date for the second release of functionality for the System of Record has been adjusted from August 1st to August 31st as FinCEN continues to balance resources between addressing production issues, analyzing potential new enhancement requests, and completing planned release 2 functionality.  Release 2 will augment the current production release by providing additional third party data sources, deploying bulk data distribution (form-based files) into production, and making National Exchange Information Model (NIEM&mdash;XML-based information exchange) available as an alternative to the bulk data recipients.

Ongoing Milestone 5 (Integrated Deployment Phase) activities include continued roll-out of Database Implementation (DI) functionality based on principles outlined in the DI Deployment Plan.  Current focus is on the delivery of Database Version 2.2; Daily Updates to the CADE 2 Database/Cycle Synchronization; and on-line viewing of the database through feeds to downstream systems, referred to as Corporate Files On-Line/Data Access Service (CFOL/DAS).  CADE 2 Database Version 2.2 began production initialization on July 23, which is planned to take 28 days.   Meanwhile, Daily Updates/Cycle Synchronization functionality continues in Final Integration Testing, and will be put into production (August timeframe) once the Database V 2.2 is initialized, followed by production feeds to downstream systems (CFOL/DAS) for on-line viewing functionality (September timeframe).   Extensive data integrity validation efforts between the legacy master file and the new CADE 2 database are ongoing to gain confidence in data transformation tools and results in preparation for September production.On July 9, the CADE 2 Executive Steering Committee approved plans for the program to work toward a &ldquo;conditional&rdquo; Milestone 5 exit in September 2012 upon completion of production delivery of Database V2.2 Initialization, Daily Updates/Cycle Synchronization and CFOL/DAS functionality.  The Milestone 5 exit &ldquo;condition&rdquo; will be satisfied with delivery of the CADE 2 feed to the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) at the conclusion of the 2013 Filing Season (approximately May 2013).  This affords more time for rigorous testing of IDRS before production deployment and allows the IDRS downstream system feeds solution to be evaluated in context with early planning efforts for CADE 2 Transition State 2 (TS 2) data access/distribution strategy.For TS 2, a high-level planning effort launched in May is clarifying the scope and framework through six work streams.  The TS 2 Implementation Strategy and Approach, targeted for delivery in the September - October timeframe, will integrate work products from these efforts.","Yes","12033","169847","13:53:25"

Testing activities are continuing to trend and the schedule variance is (-245.07%).The variance explanation provided on 6/1/12 is still relevant and applicable. There were multiple outside factors that caused the project to slip. First factor an IRS regulation change that took effect in January 2011 which drove 1.5 million new users to EFTPS and increased transaction volume. This caused EFTPS web application to experience slow response times. To remediate the issues, an increase to resources included internet bandwidth, webserver CPU power and mainframe CPU power referred to as MIPS. A decision was made to freeze development and both projects were on hold for two months. A third party conducted a technology assessment to ensure the stability of the system and re-evaluated the AS400 to Unix project. The third party advice combined with findings expanded the testing scope associated with the project.

Auction Data Warehouse Project (Auction Data Warehouse Project (Build and implement warehouse capabilities to mine and query auction data) - Phase one and two completed.- Phase three is in progress. BPD is currently receiving the vendor billing as deliverables are completed instead of on a fixed monthly basis as originally forecasted. This is due to higher vendor involvement in the early phases of the project than expected.  The overall contract is a fixed awarded agreement that cannot be changed; therefore, vendor involvement will scale down as the project progresses resulting in the project coming in on budget as planned.","Yes","5595","60649","08:06:36"

The OCC had completed the deployment to OCC examiners in the fall of 2011 however, the Blackberry deployment to former OTS staff was delayed to align it with the overall OTS migration efforts.  This delay resulted in a final project schedule variance of -176%.  -Mobile Information Protection (MIPS) Deployment - The first activity for this project (Package MIPS software) was completed on February 15, 2012.  The second activity (Deploy MIPS Software) has also been delayed to align it with other OTS migration efforts.  This delay has resulted in a project schedule variance of -66% for March 2012.

The CDX investment is in the Mixed Life Cycle phase and is within acceptable levels of cost and schedule variance. The Central Data Exchange investment requires re-baselining at this time due to cuts in the Enacted Budget. During the development of BY2013 E300 Process, CDX set a Planned Budget which was reviewed and approved by OEI IMO and EPA CPIC Offices and submitted to OMB. However, due to agency budget changes, the available budget for CDX BY2013 activities was reduced drastically from the Planned Budget. Continuing Resolutions delayed the release of the final Enacted Budget numbers preventing CDX from revising the Exhibit 300 during the available resubmission windows. This has resulted in CDX reporting monthly against the higher Planned Budget amounts. CDX requests initiation of re-baseline in order to align Planned costs for Project Activities with the revised Enacted budget. CDX will complete this re-baseline by updating the Project Activities Table in eCPIC with revised estimates for Planned and Projected Costs. Current Planned Costs, which were derived from the Planned Budget, will be downwardly revised proportional to the reduction in available funds issued in the Enacted Budget. These changes will be made simultaneously with the July 2012 IT Dashboard Update.","Yes","11441","163493","09:08:28"

This is the result of an 18-month collaborative project with the Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council to build a new site that will help the federal government better fill the needs of our applicants and our agencies.It is a highly complex project; the site serves millions of Americans and ties into many different back-end IT systems - each agency has its own.  As with any project of this magnitude, there have been issues to iron out. OPM is getting feedback from users about what is working and what isn't.  User feedback was essential to designing the upgrade, and it's been essential to identifying issues over the first week of operation.  We are reading everything that users are posting to the USAJOBS Facebook and Twitter accounts, answering the most common questions, and resolving individual issues as well.On Monday, October 17, 2011, OPM passed an important milestone: over 100,000 applications submitted through the new system.  To be exact, Americans have submitted 141,289 applications for Federal jobs through the new USAJOBS in the first week.  So we know the system is working for a lot of people.

The USAJOBS 3.0 web site and supporting information system application is used to display all open US government jobs to the public and Federal employees.  While the first week had its issues (capacity, search capabilities, and helpdesk), in the next two weeks, many if not all these issues were corrected.  The Program Management Office was aggressive in developing a citizen communication strategy involving various social media websites and was timely in responding to citizen postings relating to USAJOBS 3.0 problems on those websites.  In certain cases, OPM helpdesk technicians responded directly to individual citizens to resolve their problems; helpdesk tickets are now lower than those of USAJOBS 2.0.

Between October 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010 Federal agencies used USA Staffing to post 25,393 job announcements, process over 1.6 million applications, and make 36,134 selections. During this timeframe, USA Staffing maintained 99.7% availability and had 332,356,824 hits (events) and 157,005,972 views (request to load a single page) on its websites.    The program has commenced the implementation of virtual server technology within the USA Staffing platforms.  This technology makes more efficient use of physical server resources by allowing multiple virtual servers to exist within a single physical server.  This also reduces the overall power consumption.  To date, virtualization has been utilized in USA Staffing s development, test, training and production environments.  More virtualization is planned for February as the program begins the transition of web applications to 64-bit.    USA Staffing was migrated to Microsoft Visual Studio/Team Foundation Sever (TFS) 2010 in order to take advantage of better integration for requirements, development, testing, and the entire lifecycle process.  SharePoint is used for easy access and maintenance of requirements, linking them to work items in TFS.

In the past six months, DoD and HHS have selected USA Staffing over competing alternatives for enterprise-wide implementation. Furthermore, the Department of Veterans Affairs is expanding the use of USA Staffing to cover all hiring authorities after several years of use for Delegated Examining;  OPM and the Social Security Administration have used USA Staffing enterprise-wide for more than five years. HRS has maintained a high level of performance during this period of significant growth, as USA Staffing has maintained over 99% system availability and has not suffered any security breaches; USA Staffing experienced a single inadvertent release of one applicant s PII in February that was caused by human error and reported to the OPM Situation Room.
