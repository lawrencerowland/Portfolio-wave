009-000000704,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"The overall scope of this investment is to provide Operations and Maintenance and Enterprise Administrative support for CMS activities. The goal is to provide a reporting, application and data environment that is reliable and cost effective by reducing redundant activities. The areas are, Business Intelligence, Extract, Transform, and Load of data. Enterprise admin, operations, and maintenance of the CMS BI/ETL environment which provides secure user access to various CMS enterprise data stores. This enables the Agency to meet mission-critical activities, provide database and middleware support for the 820 databases across the data lifecycle for the mainframe and mid-tier environments. DBAs, monitor, manage and fine-tune the Agency's database environments to assure system performance and data access remains at an acceptable level; ensure the integrity and recoverability of all supported database platforms containing critical program data. MQ Administration: support the messaging environment to allow applications to provide data between the zones in the 3-zone Internet architecture, and interfaces provide message transport for services to and from CMS partners. QRep Administration: Provides replication services to allow Operational data not to be impacted by the needs of reporting and data feeds. Some of the data marts being populated by Q-Replication support Beneficiary enrollment and eligibility. Central Data Administration (CDA): Supports operational activities associated with the use of the Agency's data through the data lifecycle--from capture through archiving. CDA provides guidance and assistance in the development, maintenance, administration, and enforcement of CMS data asset reuse and metadata standards, guidelines, and procedures; knowledge regarding data and metadata architecture, management, administration, standards, methodologies and associated tools; participating in Joint Application Development sessions; crafting conceptual and logical data models, etc. Cobol Contractors support the legacy systems including NCH, Medpar, IBNR, Mads, etc. to implement coding changes and provide the technical support for ongoing operations. PM support is required to effectively manage the myriad of projects involving data access initiatives and data stores.","The overall scope of this investment supports agency initiatives in an Enterprise manner.  The areas of Administrative Tool support is the platform for multiple CMS project and application investments.  The reuse of these Tools and Administrative support reduces the need to procure multiple support environments, saving CMS effort in both the financial and technical sectors.  Below are brief synopses on the impact of each area that this investment covers. Business Intelligence (BI), Extract, Transform, and Load of data ETL. This investment provides a wide range of data user's access to several levels of data through BI/ETL tools to enable further analysis based on observations in trends in the data. In addition the ETL tools used to homogenize the data provide more accurate and timely data for all users having access to the investment. Database Administration (DBA): This area supports all the System of Record for both Beneficiary and Provider data.  Without the support and administration of the supporting database systems this data would be unavailable for system use.  This would cause impact to many systems, including the Beneficiary Eligibility and Enrollment systems, and Provider Enrollment and Chain Ownership systems. MQ Administration: This area supports MQ and Middleware support for 40+ applications across mainframe and mid-tier environments. This area also provides coordination for application services the environment, and the maintenance and administration of middleware and messaging products.  Impact to this area, would cause possible outages to systems such as the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, and the Medicare Beneficiary Database Interfaces. QRep Administration: Provides Database Replication for MMA Part D, and ARRA Hi-Tech data. This includes 107+ tables and 2+ terabytes of storage. This information supports all MMA Part D data marts and outbound data feeds.  If Replication services are not working correctly the feed of beneficiary data to beneficiary support systems would be at risk. Central Data Administration (CDA): This support system provides the tracking and standards of data elements used throughout CMS.  Through the use of Logical Data Models, the ability to look at data redundancy and data reuse scenarios helps to keep unnecessary redundancy in check.  Without this service, data reuse between applications, and the tracking of Metadata for application use at an Enterprise level would be lost.","* Completed development and publication of the Part A dashboard. * Completed development and publication of the Part D dashboard.* Completed data models in support of ACA, ARRA Hi-Tech, and various others.* Completed Enterprise Data Center (CDS) integration of messaging cluster with the CMS Baltimore data center.* Completed Movement of Message Broker (Service Bus) environment to the z/Linux environment. * Completed database creation for Hi-Tech activities.* Completed Service Publications for MBD/Beneficiary Notifications, removing the multiple application integration need.",* Support of additional databases necessary for various applications supporting new initiatives.* Support of additional messaging support for various applications supporting new initiatives.* Provide data mining support to validate data modeling to be used in Fraud Detection.* Provide integration services between data centers with messaging support.* Support the ACO program.* Support the HITECH program.* Provide administration of Business Intelligence tools for critical programs and projects such as fraud and abuse.,108.813,23.344,23.38,23.755,2007.0,2020.0,"The current funding levels for this investment were developed through the CMS' annual CPIC process.

009-000000706,9,Department of Health and Human Services,15,Health Resources and Services Administration,"The mission of HRSA is to improve health and achieve health equity through access to quality services, a skilled health workforce and innovative programs. HRSA assures the availability of quality health care to low income, uninsured, isolated, vulnerable and special needs populations. In meeting its mission, HRSA relies on the Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) to assist with improving the performance of HRSA funded programs, sharing data and conducting business in a more efficient manner. The EHBs currently serves more than 40,000 users in managing HRSA grants and projects. EHBs support HRSA with program administration, grants administration and monitoring, management reporting, and performance measurement and analysis. The investment serves HRSA's goal to integrate existing grant support systems into one transparent enterprise-wide system. In conjunction with GRANTS.GOV, this system has streamlined the application and administration process and has enabled applicants, grantee organizations and HRSA to communicate and conduct activities electronically. It allows HRSA to operate in a paperless fashion, with improved business efficiency, and in compliance with mandated Agency-wide and Federal policies, procedures and legislation. The system provides all potential grantees a means to access competitive funding opportunities published as a part of the annual HRSA Preview and to submit applications electronically. HRSA uses HHS ACF's Center of Excellence (COE) for grant award processing. The system provides Grantees electronic means for completing post-award reporting requirements and aid HRSA program staff with conducting in-depth analysis of program grant allocation, use and effectiveness. The EHBs have allowed for a standardization of many of HRSA's business processes as a result of the consolidation.","HRSA does not have identified performance gaps in support of mission delivery. EHBs provides an e-Government solution to grant lifecycle management, allowing more than 100 grant, loan, and scholarship programs to effectively and efficiently support their citizen customers. A lack of full funding will limit enhancements to the system. These enhancements are necessary to meet Congressional and Executive reporting requirement changes, automate remaining manual processes, improve computing efficiency, update the system to the latest available technology, and simplify processes for users. Failure to fund ongoing maintenance and operations needs will require HRSA to add staff to complete grants management processes via a paper process and limit customer service to grantees in managing their grants.","The EHBs added functionality in two areas: the grant review and awards process, as well as, several areas within the post-award data collection function. In the grant review area, financial investigation capability was added. Financial investigations were handled in separate databases with some manual workflow and paper routing. In the awards area, additional streamlining actions took place to quicken the non-competing continuing grants process. In prior years, grantees needed to reapply for grants every year, even when the project period was 3 to 5 years. These grants, called non-competing continuations, now must simply request continuation, which HRSA evaluates using a simpler review process.  In the post-award area, the investment integrated the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education into the EHBs grant management process.","The EHBs will add functionality in two areas: the grant planning process and performance monitoring, as well as, several areas within the post-award data collection function. All new functionality will adopt the new user interface. Some existing functionality will retrofitted to use the new interface. The current planning process requires 370 days to prepare, announce, review, award, and document grants. The process will be streamlined to reduce the number of days required for this entire process, helping grantees receive awards faster from the time of application.  The EHBs will expand the dashboard capability originally conceived for the Bureau of Primary Healthcare to offer customized dashboard capability for each of HRSA's internal stakeholders: each Bureau and Office, various user roles, as well as Grantees. The post award process will have two major improvements. Some of the Bureau of Health Professions programs will begin collecting data for longitudinal study, requiring a redesign of the EHBs data model. The Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education program will update the entire system to work more efficiently within the EHBs architecture. The HIV/AIDS Bureau will extend their new data elements that track individual patient data to additional grantees. This will further improve the Bureau to enhance program design and delivery. In BY13, some of the performance data collection processes will update their user interface to match the new EHBs GUI, making use of the EHBs easier for frantees.

009-000000714,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"   The primary purpose of this investment is to establish an accurate, current, and comprehensive database containing standardized enrollment, eligibility, and paid claims of Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries. This data will be used for the administration of Medicaid at the Federal level, to produce statistical reports, support Medicaid related research, and assist in the detection of fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This investment satisfies the core business function for the information needs of the Center for Medicaid, CHIP and Survey and Certification (CMCS). This investment also directly supports the PMA initiative of Expanded E-government through electronic data transmission and data sharing. It also supports the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, the Federal Upper Limits program, procurement of compendia data, State Plan Amendments, Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic & Treatment program, Drug Data Reporting for Medicaid (DDR) web application and the DCCA Data Center (which hosts DDR and 6 other Medicaid application from another contract), the Medicaid & State Children Health Insurance Program Budget & Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), and Medicaid and grant funding. Additionally, it helps achieve the HHS Strategic goal to 'Improve health care quality, safety, cost, and value' and supports CMS' strategic goal of promoting fiscal integrity. The annual operational analysis indicates this investment continues to provide the expected benefits and fill the gap for which it was designed and continues to be the most cost-effective solution.   The Medicaid Data Systems include the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), as well as data storage (flat files, data warehouse, and data marts). Besides being the core information system for CMCS, MSIS supports much of the Medicaid research and analysis performed by the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service. MSIS, and the accompanying data storage, are also a key resource for other Federal agencies and research projects involving Medicaid.","This investment will close the gap in support of the mission delivery and management support by making extensive changes to the existing MSIS and significant changes to the states' MMIS. To satisfy the new requirements, the MSIS will collect and report on 300-500 additional data elements on a projected monthly collection/reporting process. This will require technical assistance for the states to 1) identify state source systems for new data elements, 2) collaborate with the State CHIP Agency for reporting data to MSIS, 3) ensure that Managed Care plans are sending necessary claims data to states, and 4) ensure and map managed care claims into MSIS.

009-000001359,9,Department of Health and Human Services,17,Indian Health Services,"The National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) is the national data repository of the Indian Health Service (IHS).  It is a steady-state investment in the O&M life-cycle. NPIRS produces specific reports that are required by statute and regulation.  Additionally, NPIRS maintains composite patient encounter information to provide managers at all levels of the Indian health system with a broad range of clinical and administrative information through data marts that allow them to better manage individual patients, local facilities, regional and national programs.   NPIRS data is derived from various government and commercial healthcare information systems that are largely transaction-based systems used to support patient care.  The data comprises patient registration and clinical encounter records.  The data repository provides reports and ad hoc searches of the databases.  Internal users and selected authorized external users have secure access to more structured and specific subsets of this information (data marts).  In support of HIT, it provides a means for other to achieve the public health requirements of meaningful use by providing a public capacity to receive reporting information requirements.   NPIRS supports HHS Strategic Goal 4 Objective A, ensuring program integrity and responsible stewardship of resources, by maintaining user population and workload information attributed to each of the 12 IHS administrative areas. It provides composite information needed to measure IHS performance and the allocation of funds to tribal facilities and provides management with the information necessary to cost-beneficially allocate scarce medical resources.  NPIRS also supports HHS Strategic Goal 4 Objective A by collecting and integrating information from Tribal, Urban, State, private sector, and other Federal sources (e.g. IHS Fiscal Intermediary, CMS) to facilitate effective collaboration and sharing of this information on-line through more accurate and timely reports through the data marts.  In BY2013, NPIRS will continue to provide legislatively-required reports on composite patient encounter and health care and will be available to integrate its data into additional structured reports through data marts, as required by IHS managers.    New project manager came on board on January 10, 2011 from DOD with PMP certification.  FAC-P/PM and DAWIA criteria are under review and certification will be completed by December 30, 2011.","The NPIRS investment closes a performance gap by providing a National Data Warehouse; a facility that collects, verifies, and aggregates clinical and administrative data at a national level that would otherwise only be collected through various and disparate local IT systems. This allows IHS management to provide legislatively required reports to the Administration and Congress, including the Administrative Area Workload and the IHS Headquarters User Population reports. These reports are an integral part of IHS's funding decisions. As an Operations and Maintenance investment, NPIRS continues to provide a broad range of retrospective clinical and administrative information to managers within the Indian health system to allow them to better manage individual patients, local facilities, regional and national programs. An Operational Analysis is scheduled for FY2012 to ensure that this system continues to meet this investments goals, objectives, and performance measures in the most efficient and effective way. If this investment was not fully funded, the impact would be increased cost and burden of collecting data and reduced accuracy of the data collected. This would impede the creation of the federally mandated workload and user population reports, which in turn would affect the allocation of money at the area level. Not fully funding this investment could also negatively impact the reporting of Meaningful Use requirements.","Investment accomplishmentsin the prior year include the NPIRS hardware relocation to a consolidated data center at the Albuquerque Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) facility.  The implementation of single sign on (SSO), which allows users to login to their D1 account as well as view NPIRS reports. The analysis, design, and testing of the method of migration, from current un-duplication software (Quality Stage 7.5) to new un-duplication software (Quality Stage 8.5). The source control repository migration from Linux server to AIX server, which will utilize a component of the Rational Suite. New functionality includes the initiation of SAP Business Objects applications to add greater business intelligence capabilities for IHS Headquarters and the Area Statistical Officers and report availability to lower Area administrative levels. Operational efficiencies include the NPIRS hardware upgrade and initial system virtualization in preparation of NPIRS portfolio expansion.","Key planned activities in the current year include the consolidation of the MPI and the CER's LDI systems into the National Data Warehouse (NDW) infrastructure and the implementation of virtualization standardization within the OIT production environments, including the Rockville disaster recovery requirements.

009-000001361,9,Department of Health and Human Services,15,Health Resources and Services Administration,"The purpose of the National Practitioner Data Bank-Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (NPDB-HIPDB) is to protect the public, improve the quality of health care, and deter fraud and abuse in the health care system by providing information about past adverse actions of practitioners, providers, or suppliers to authorized health care entities and agencies. The data provided must be current, as the information stored is used by entities to make decisions such as whether to give a medical practitioner a state license or to grant a practitioner clinical privileges. The vision for the NPDB-HIPDB program is to serve as a confidential information clearinghouse to potential employers, enabling them to make better hiring decisions and provide for a better quality health workforce. The NPDB is a flagging system that provides authorized entities with the means to help protect public health by providing vital information that impedes the ability of incompetent health care practitioners to move from State to State without discovery of previous substandard performance or unprofessional conduct. The NPDB discloses to eligible entities information on medical malpractice payments, adverse clinical privileges and licensure, and other adverse actions taken against physicians, dentists, and other health care providers by State licensing authorities, hospitals, and professional societies. The HIPDB was designed to reduce healthcare fraud and abuse by collecting and disclosing to authorized entities information on health care related civil judgments and criminal convictions, adverse licensure and certification actions, exclusions from health care programs, and other adjudicated actions taken against health care providers, suppliers, and practitioners. Under the Affordable Care Act, the HIPDB will be merged into the NPDB, thus ending the duplication of effort and cost between the two Data Banks and allowing users to obtain the same information with a single query. The NPDB-HIPDB supports both The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS' Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) missions by providing key resources to prevent and reduce health care fraud and abuse. Further, the program's performance measures and activities build upon HRSA's strategic plan and are keyed to the agency's goal to improve access to quality health care and services. Note that there are no dependencies between this investment and other investments.","The legislation that led to the creation of the NPDB-HIPDB was enacted because the U.S. Congress perceived that the increasing occurrence of medical malpractice litigation and the need to improve the quality of medical care had become nationwide problems that warranted greater efforts than those that could be undertaken by any individual State. Effective professional peer review can restrict the ability of incompetent practitioners to move from State to State without disclosure or discovery of previous damaging or incompetent performance. Congress felt that the threat of private money damage liability under Federal laws, including treble damage liability under Federal antitrust law, unreasonably discouraged physicians and dentists from participating in effective professional peer review. Therefore, Congress sought to provide incentive and protection for physicians, dentists, and other health practitioners engaging in effective professional peer review. Prior to establishment of the National Practitioner Data Bank, physicians could readily move from one state to another when they lost their license to practice medicine, when they had major malpractice settlements, and when they were asked to leave the medical staff of a particular community hospital.  With required reporting, all the information is now logged into the NPDB-HIPDB and provider-specific information is available for review by authorized persons. As mandated by the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, the NPDB-HIPDB functions in a self-supportive manner through the collection of user fees. As required, those fees cover the full cost of the NPDB-HIPDB, and no Federal appropriation monies are requested or received (i.e., Federal taxes do not support the Data Banks). User fees are established at a level to cover all program costs to allow the Data Banks to meet short and long term program performance goals. Fees are established based on query volume, in order to ensure adequate revenues are available to cover all program costs.","Many enhancements were made to the NPDB-NIPDB in FY2011. In the area of Self-Query & Entity Registration, a self query diagnostic log was made available and entity user roles were established. In terms of Security, identity proofing for all entities and users was implemented, a fraud detection service was made available for user login, and second factor authentication for investigative searches was implemented. Billing improvements included providing users the ability to check payment credits. Further, HIPDB merge work began this fiscal year. In terms of communication, Data Bank branding work was completed, and a new informational web site went live.","A number of future enhancements are planned for the NPDB-HIPDB in FY2012 (CY) and FY2013 (BY). Release 5.22, currently scheduled for deployment in December 2011, will provide report form usability enhancements and secure messaging for users. Release 5.23, planned for March 2012, will allow reporters to forward actions to licensing boards, improve multiple primary functions, and provide enhanced registration that will improve reporting compliance.

009-000001362,9,Department of Health and Human Services,17,Indian Health Services,"The Indian Health Service (IHS) Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is a comprehensive health information system (HIS) created to support the delivery of high quality health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives who attend several hundred Federal, Tribal, and Urban facilities nationwide. RPMS is critical to IHS operations and integrates practice management, medical, behavioral health, population health and performance reporting functions into a fully capable electronic health record (EHR) suite. RPMS evolved alongside the Veterans Administration's acclaimed VistA HIS but occupies a unique place as the only system designed specifically to support the direct care and public health mission of the IHS. RPMS aligns with the Administration's commitment to promoting the adoption of EHRs due to their ability to improve health outcomes and decrease costs. RPMS supports the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) by establishing interoperability through the electronic sharing of information with states, interoperability with commercial labs, and electronic communication among medical staff participating in patient care.  RPMS supports HHS Goal 1 Objective F by providing a Meaningful Use Certified EHR and empowering the patient with personal health information.  The RPMS EHR is certified as a complete EHR for ambulatory and inpatient settings according to the criteria for Stage 1 Meaningful Use, and is in use at more than 300 sites nationwide, including all Federal facilities. IHS participated in trials of the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) and is progressing in the full implementation of the NwHIN gateway, supporting HIT Principle 3. RPMS is in the mixed lifecycle phase; much of the suite is in operations and maintenance, while modernization and enhancements are planned for FY12-13 for the ICD-10 conversion. RPMS continues to invest in maintenance, including protecting the privacy and security of information, supporting HIT Principle 5. RPMS has incorporated open source software, maintaining an effective system with low cost, supporting HIT Principle 4. As a high-quality, low-cost public domain system, RPMS has also proven attractive to private and public sector health care entities outside of IHS. RPMS is dependent upon the IHS Infrastructure, Office Automation, and Telecommunications (IOAT) Investment as it provides the physical computer and networking systems and support on which RPMS is operated.","Electronic information systems, including practice management and electronic health record systems, are an industry standard for health care. Performance gaps that would exist if RPMS were not operational and continually enhanced would include electronic submission of claims, meaningful use of electronic health record technology, performance assessment and clinical quality measurement (e.g. GPRA), and data interoperability and health information exchange.","The RPMS Program completed and deployed 8 major package releases, 7 medium and minor releases, including 14 major and 69 medium and minor patches, delivering operational improvements to multiple integrated applications in response to mandated Health Information Technology (HIT) initiatives and regulatory requirements. Functionality provided resulted in the successful attainment of Stage 1 Meaningful Use Certification facilitating the first CMS incentive payments made to Cherokee Nation WW Hastings Hospital, deployment of IHS' first Personal Health Record (PHR) portal, as well as improved graphical user interfaces for Patient Registration and Scheduling. Additional functionality supporting enhanced population health and epidemiology surveillance was deployed through the iCare application. The RPMS Program delivered 450 training events, reaching more than 7000 users through virtual and on-site trainings. The Certified EHR was deployed to 59 sites for a total of 311 sites system wide.","FY2012 funding made available for development will be utilized for planning and analysis of multiple applications to determine gaps to be remediated in order to transition to the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10), as well as beginning remediation development and testing to meet the 2013 deadline for ICD-10 implementation. Operational FY2012 and FY2013 funding will be utilized as efficiently as possible to support ongoing maintenance in RPMS resulting from enhancements made with funding received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. These activities are focused on maintaining functionality and to ensure ongoing certification of the EHR and supporting applications required to remain compliant with Meaningful Use Certification, compliance with new HIPAA 5010 Transaction Standards, as well as prepare for additional needs identified for future stages of Meaningful Use planned for completion in FY2013 and FY2014.

009-000001372,9,Department of Health and Human Services,20,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"In 2003, CDC developed an electronic syndromic surveillance system called BioSense that uses health-related data to identify patterns of disease symptoms prior to specific diagnoses. In late 2007, CDC began to redesign the program to improve collaboration with stakeholders and address identified management weaknesses. In FY10, CDC started redesigning the BioSense program based on input and guidance from local, state, and federal partners. The goal of the redesign effort is to be able to provide nationwide and regional situational awareness for all-hazard health-related threats and to support national, state, and local responses to those threats.  While the redesign is planned to occur over the next few years, modification and maintenance of the BioSense surveillance networks is expected to be a systematic and continuous process that will evolve throughout the redesign and thereafter in response to new information and stakeholders needs. The redesigned BioSense program will focus on: 1) improving coordination and links between existing state and local disease surveillance monitoring systems and BioSense, and 2) moving from a need-to-know to a need-to-share  model by building a Network of Networks for sharing information, insights, interpretations, lessons-learned, protocols, and technical assistance.  By integrating local and state-level data into a cohesive picture, BioSense will improve its utility for state and local users. This is consistent with the 2006 Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), 2007 Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-21), Health IT Guiding Principles, all of which call for regional and nationwide public health situation awareness, through an interoperable network of systems, built on existing state and local situation awareness capability.  The structure of BioSense Redesign (2.0) differs substantially from its original design. As a response to stakeholders' constraints related to technology and funding, the Program has shifted to a community-owned implementation where stakeholders will share in ownership of the system. BioSense 2.0 terminated the collection and maintenance of raw clinical data at CDC. Utilizing Cloud technology, BioSense 2.0 emphasizes the direct reporting of data from hospitals to state and local health departments instead of CDC. ASTHO is responsible for providing a community-controlled environment hosted on the Internet Cloud or support individual capable Health Departments.","The BioSense Program is critical to improving local, state, and federal surveillance capacity to increase insight into the health of communities and the country. It helps guide public health decision making and action at the local, regional and national level. With BioSense, the public health community is able to more efficiently track health problems as they evolve and provide public health officials with the data, information and tools they need to better prepare for and coordinate responses to public health crisis. In real-world application, BioSense has contributed advances to the field of public health surveillance and has provided key support for numerous responses to public health emergencies.The BioSense program worked with partners on defining 90 syndromes and sub-syndromes that encompass infections, injuries, chronic diseases, exposures, miscellaneous conditions and specified ICD-9 codes, and free-text search terms corresponding to these concepts. Working with the academic community, the BioSense program performed research on and provided practical applications for spatio-temporal scanning (SaTScan) and anomaly detection algorithms. The BioSense program created the minimum dataset specification which was later adopted by the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP). BioSense has also generated details and peer reviewed publications establishing the knowledge and experience about the data analytic issues for timely public health surveillance.The program sustained a 40% budget cut in FY2012 which absorbed much of the IT cost savings of BioSense 2.0. BioSense had planned to utilize these cost savings by funding state and local health departments. With these cuts, BioSense 2.0 faced severe restrictions with workforce capacity support for the states with the possibility of not being able to support some states already.  Further cuts would be catastrophic to CDC as well as the state health departments and the public health community at large. Without the public health surveillance and human capacity support provided by BioSense 2.0, many states would not be able to maintain their own syndromic surveillance or collaborate with other jurisdictions hampering the ability to serve the larger regional or national population as a whole.","A new Data User Agreement (DUA) template was established which provides a foundation for managing the provisions and policies for the constituents of the new BioSense 2.0 system. In November 2011, BioSense 2.0 was launched. The BioSense Team began the recruitment of new BioSense stakeholders as a part of the BioSense 2.0 implementation. As of May 2012, new Data User Agreements have been established with 15 states. BioSense 1.0 was retired which included the bifurcation of data feeds from BioSense 1.0 to 2.0. This included the shutdown of existing data feeds to BioSense 1.0. A prototype system was developed and used to obtain feedback from stakeholders and end users. The feedback gained from stakeholders will allow further improvements in the functionality of the BioSense system.","Establish performance measures and metrics that reflect industry standards for technology performance and highlight the Program's new collaborative, community-centered architecture. Establish a permanent community-owned (local, state, and federal) governance model that establishes the guidance and policies for regulating the BioSense 2.0 ecosystem and environment.

009-000001378,9,Department of Health and Human Services,20,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"NEDSS (National Electronic Disease Surveillance System) is an initiative that promotes an Internet-based infrastructure for public health surveillance data exchange that uses PHIN (Public Health Information Network) Data Standards and includes interoperable subsystems, components, systems modules, and applications developed and implemented by CDC, state and local health departments, and commercial vendors.  NEDSS relies heavily on industry standards (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED, HL7), and policy-level agreements on data access/ protection of confidentiality.  NEDSS represents an ongoing close collaboration between the CDC and its public health partners.   When NEDSS began in 2001, no state had integrated public health surveillance systems as articulated in the NEDSS vision; today over 50 jurisdictions have implemented surveillance systems based on this vision.  CDC responded to requests from states seeking assistance to obtain NEDSS software solutions, often based on local and state information technology resource constraints by developing the CDC NEDSS Base System (NBS). Today, 18 states and one territory use the NBS.    NEDSS specific goals and planned achievements that will align with the Health IT Guidance Memo Policy Principle of measurably improve long term outcomes. NEDSS will continue to work with remaining states to fully adopt a NEDSS compatible system and develop refined benchmarks used to describe the status of standards-based interoperable electronic disease surveillance systems and incorporate in the application requirements for extramural funding.  Finally, provide CDC programs access to Nationally Notifable Diseases Surveillance (NNDSS) data for all Notifiable conditions. NEDSS spends $10.45M on extramural activities that are not part of this business case, but is a separate line on the OMB Ex53. The benefit of the investment is to achieve the NEDSS mission to improve the nation's ability to identify, monitor, and investigate diseases and conditions of public health importance, by enabling public health agencies to use information technology more effectively.  This is accomplished by 1) providing leadership in the adoption of standards-based interoperable systems, which are critical for an efficient national strategy; 2) developing and supporting key tools for collecting, exchanging and analyzing information; and 3) providing resources to state and local health departments for the required personnel, training and equipment.","*          CDC WB2: Healthcare-Associated Infections Prevention Goals*          HHS Goal 5: Prevent the spread of infectious diseases*          CDC IT:  Collaboration and innovation*         HHS IT:  Enable and improve the integration and quality of health and human services informationThis investment addresses the above key HHS and CDC goals. NEDSS is a conduit to support NNDSS.  NEDSS develops and promulgates policy and standards consistent with CDC's Public Health Information Network (PHIN).  This includes the use of standard vocabulary and codes as mandated by HHS under the Consolidated Health Informatics initiative and CMS Meaningful Use.  NEDSS supports the development and maintenance of the NBS and the adoption of NEDSS compatible systems.  NEDSS supports the development and maintenance of the Message Subscription Service (MSS), an integration data brokering tool and services, to enable electronic messaging capacity among public health stakeholders.  NEDSS also supports key data provisioning activities maintained by the Division of Informatics Solutions and Operations to receive and process electronic nationally notifiable disease case notifications from state and territorial health departments.  The data is used to support national surveillance activity by CDC programs.Finally, NEDSS provides extramural funding to build capacity in state and territorial health departments.  This is in line with HHS and CDC goals as well as the Director's strategic priority to strengthen epidemiology and surveillance capacity. If not fully funded, this will impact all levels of government, including reduction of 112 state personnel in 56 jurisdictions, slow down the adoption of standards-based ELR and case notification from states to CDC programs under NNDSS, and reduction of coverage by CDC to provide application, tools, training, and technical assistance to states.","*Provided funding to 57 states/territories through the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC), extramural activity, to support electronic disease surveillance for the required personnel, training and equipment* Provided ongoing training and technical assistance to local/state/federal health jurisdictions to enable electronic data exchange for laboratory reports, case reports, and case notifications*As part of the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), conduct operational analysis and biweekly user group calls for the NEDSS investment*Deployed several patch releases to address security, user interface and data handling issues*Deployed two major NBS releases*Provided a fully interactive web support portal for the NBS user group-Developed an implementation plan to incorporate the functionality of the Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Management Information System (MIS) into NBS-Full implementation of open source governance of the NBS application.","Current Year 2013 Planned Accomplishments:*          Provide CDC Programs with access to NEDSS formatted data via data marts and views*          Provide Message Mapping Guides (MMG) that describe the content of data that reporting jurisdictions should submit through NEDSS to the NNDSS*          Provide funding to 57 states/territories through the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC), extramural activity, to support electronic disease surveillance for the required personnel, training and equipment *          Provide ongoing training and technical assistance to local/state/federal health jurisdictions to enable electronic data exchange for laboratory reports, case reports, and case notifications *          NBS Release 4.4.1 (Minor release, Dec 2012) will restructure the security/role administration to eliminate the dependency on commercial application, Sun One LDAP, which is being sunset by Oracle.

In hospitals alone, nearly 2 million patients acquire infections that contribute to more than 88,000 deaths and cost more than $4.5 billion annually. Healthcare personnel are also at risk of acquiring infection while performing their duties.  The Surveillance Branch in CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) today, is used for a variety of purposes including infection control, healthcare worker safety, blood safety, process-of-care measurement and improvement, prevention research, mandatory public reporting, and public health surveillance.  Over 4500 healthcare facilities are enrolled with an estimated target of 5000+ facilities within the year. In addition to manual data entry, NHSN is leading an effort to utilize pre-existing electronic data from EHR and other healthcare information systems using HL7 balloted and standardized Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents for automated data entry.NHSN  is a highly visible project in support of the CDC-wide Winnable Battles initiative.  The critical priorities established for the Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Winnable Battle include timely progress on national HAI surveillance and more specifically further expansion of NHSN and acceleration of electronic reporting from healthcare facilities to the CDC surveillance system. The Surveillance Branch also has lead responsibility for developing and maintaining the technical infrastructure of operational systems used by CDC and its partners for surveillance of adverse drug events, other adverse events in healthcare, and adherence to prevention practices.  To accomplish this mission with maximal efficiency and economy, the Surveillance Branch shares human and material resources to the fullest extent possible in development and maintenance work across surveillance systems, including work on NHSN and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System - Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance (NEISS-CADES).

This Act (Public Law 107-188) requires maintenance of a national database of entities that are registered for possession of SA & toxins, laboratory compliance with national safety guidelines, security measures including controlled access to SA & toxins, security screening of entities and personnel, and criminal/civil penalties for inappropriate use of SA/toxins. Development of the National Select Agent Registry (NSAR) began in 2003 as a joint CDC & USDA system designed to control, protect, store & oversee the use, possession & transfer of SA & toxins.A 2009 External Program Review found that the NSAR system does not adequately support the needs of the organization and negatively impacts Select Agent Program (SAP) processes.   Additionally, a 2009 Operational Analysis noted that the system fails to meet over 90% of program requirements.  CDC then initiated an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) regarding potential upgrades and/or replacement of NSAR.  Based on these assessments of NSAR, management decided to extend the service life of NSAR by implementing two new projects, NSAR 6.0 and eNSAR. These projects will improve the application's performance, and will allow NSAR to support a much larger percentage of the program's requirements, enabling the SAP to meet its mission more effectively and efficiently.","The purpose of this investment is to support HHS and USDA's legislated responsibilities to maintain a national database of entities that are registered for possession of SA & toxins, laboratory compliance with national safety guidelines, security measures including controlled access to SA & toxins, security screening of entities and personnel, and criminal/civil penalties for inappropriate use of SA/toxins.Failure to fund this investment would prevent CDC and USDA from complying with the 2002 Bioterrorism Preparedness & Response Act (Public Law 107-188). Significant reductions in funding for the investment would impair CDC's ability to support inspection of entities handling Select Agents, and of managing entity records. Many of the planned future releases of NSAR support improved operational efficiency, such as entity data entry via a portal, and improved workflow and analytics, and failure to fund these releases adequately will increase costs not captured directly within the NSAR investment, such as increased manual data entry, dedicated NSAR desktop hardware, and lack of flexible reporting during a public health event.","NSAR Release 5.3 was deployed during PY (FY2011), which included a Mid Tier Data Center (MTDC) Tech Refresh, improved usability, improved Section 508 compliance, and application performance enhancements. 100% of security patches were executed at OS and desktop level for APHIS and CDC users.

VTrckS will provide capabilities to allow the CDC to manage more than $4 billion of vaccines associated with the Vaccines for Children (VFC) and Section 317 grantee funded programs. VTrckS is an enterprise system used to track federally contracted vaccine orders between manufacturers, distributor, and health care providers. VTrckS pilot implementation began in December 2010 with four pilot sites. After go-live, pilot grantees and internal users provided significant feedback for the need for enhancements and optimizations before further scale up of the system. These optimizations will be released to the pilot grantees in Feb 2012. Further rollout to the non-pilot grantees will begin in April 2012 with rollout completion in June 2013. As a Web-based system for provider ordering and automated approvals, it will improve operational efficiencies and internal controls. VTrckS is a comprehensive IT solution that eliminates current legacy system limitations, provides a scalable platform and improves vaccine management. The system allows providers to order directly from the Internet, improve internal controls, significantly reduce manual processes, and provide transparency into provider usage patterns improving data analysis capability. This near real-time inventory visibility improves preparedness and allows for a greater focus on public health.","The lack of timely, accurate information impacts CDC's ability to respond to matters of public health.  Without VTrckS, the level of command and control allowing rapid and effective response to special vaccine related situations, including a supply chain disruption (e.g. manufacturing shortage), national emergency (e.g. epidemic requiring rapid vaccine transfers), new vaccine release, or widespread crisis events (e.g. pandemic similar to the H1N1 event of 2009-2010) is severely limited. VTrckS supports CDC's management of the publicly funded vaccine supply chain by providing near real-time data used to assess grantee and provider ordering patterns and accountability efforts. This investment improves allocation, management, and distribution of public-sector vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) as essential for the health of our nation's most vulnerable children, adolescents, and adults. Additionally, administrative burdens for grantee staff are significantly reduced with VTrckS applications by providing real-time inventory visibility, formulary management, security management, and direct provider vaccine ordering capability. The VTrckS investment should allow vital and limited grantee resources to focus on primary public health activities and improve immunization coverage levels of the pediatric population.Without full funding, CDC would have to revert to home-grown legacy systems that were not designed for the current, much less the future, order volumes, and for which there is a scarcity of system support personnel. Due to the lack of integration, the legacy systems and support staff are impaired by manual processes impacting internal control over budgets, contracts, and order accuracy.  Additionally, the distributor and the manufacturers have already converted their systems and new interfaces would be required to re-integrate with the legacy systems.  Thus for reasons of risk management and vaccine delivery efficiency, especially evident during a public health event requiring inventory allocation and reassignment decisions, the VTrckS enterprise resource planning solution is best-suited for vaccine management supporting HHS' Strategic Plan; Goal 4 (Increase Efficiency, Transparency, and Accountability of HHS Programs) and Goal 5 (Strengthen the Nation's Health and Human Service Infrastructure and Workforce).","The project gained the following accomplishments: a) The four pilot grantees successfully replaced the legacy VACMAN and VOFA systems with VtrckS which includes integrated vaccine ordering and inventory management. b) Colorado replaced paper order forms at almost half of their providers with on-line ordering and will provide on-line access to all providers by the close of the     calendar year.   c) Washington and Michigan have integrated VTrckS with their immunization registries, thus enabling providers with a centralized portal to order vaccines and collect      immunization information. d) All of the bulk vaccine replenishment vaccine orders transitioned to VtrckS with the deployment of the VTrckS solution in December 2010. e) CDC replaced the legacy NIPVAC system as the back-end solution to manage federally funded vaccines, including the approval and processing of orders for          shipment and payment. f) Processed more than 2 million orders within VTrckS.","There are several activities on the horizon for the VTrckS team to either complete or start in the next fiscal year.  In February 2012, the team will release VTrckS 2.0.  This release is to include key, prioritized VTrckS enhancements and optimizations required to effectively deploy VTrckS to the remaining grantee population.  The optimizations and enhancements will help VTrckS run in a more efficient manner, allow more grantees to start using the system, CDC users to effectively support the grantee population, and all end users be more productive with VTrckS.   The optimizations and enhancements were prioritized based on a set of key program attributes associated with impact and effort with critical and high priority enhancements to be delivered as part of Release 2.0.Spend Plan functionality, a grantee generated projection of monthly aggregate provider vaccine demand by funding source and by National Drug Code (NDC), will be deployed to all grantees (pilot and non-pilot) starting in April 2012 with completion scheduled for September 2012.   CDC uses spend plans to estimate funds to be obligated to the manufacturer vaccine contracts, to determine how to fund vaccine inventory replenishment orders (VFC versus Section 317 funds), and to evaluate actual provider orders relative to the planned monthly and annual spending for each vaccine.  Spend Plan implementation will replace the final legacy Vaccine Order & Forecast (VOFA) functionality being used by non-pilot grantees, and the transition of the remaining grantees. Finally, the deployment of the enhanced VTrckS functionality to remaining non-pilot grantees will commence in the third quarter of FY 2012.  Grantees will transition onto VTrckS in cohorts until all remaining grantees are using VTrckS with a targeted roll-out completion of June 2013.  To ensure success, the grantees will be prepared for transition to VTrckS via a series of relevant modules and manuals and training activities, starting approximately 12 weeks prior to their VTrckS go-live date.  CDC implementation teams will work with grantees during their transition. Additionally for FY 2013 and after completion of the grantee roll-out, an objective assessment will determine what further optimizations and enhancements should be included in a Release 3.0 to fully leverage the efficiencies of the VTrckS solution.",58.679,18.295,25.1,16.528,,,"For FY11, the overall project cost was $18.295 M as compared to the original estimate of $12.242 M.

009-999991400,9,Department of Health and Human Services,0,Department of Health and Human Services,"In 2004, the Federal Health Architecture (FHA) Program was established as an OMB line of business (LoB) to support Federal activities related to the development and adoption of Health IT standards, ensuring that agencies seamlessly and securely exchange health data with other agencies, other government entities, and with other public and private organizations. In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established. The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors.Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy. FHA serves the needs of more than 20 Federal Agencies in domains as diverse as military and veterans' healthcare, public health monitoring, long-term care and disability services, research, tribal health services and many other critical Federal priorities.","The FHA was formed to coordinate health IT activities among the more than 20 Federal Agencies that provide health and healthcare services to citizens. FHA and its Federal partners are helping build a Federal health information technology environment that is interoperable with private sector systems and supports the President's plan to enable better point-of-service care, increased efficiency and improved overall health in the U.S. population. FHA, together with its Federal partners, addresses the requirements of EO 13410 to achieve secure, interoperable health information exchanges within the Federal Government and its consortia. FHA uses a three-step process to provide products and services that advance adoption of interoperable health information transmission among health stakeholders -- identify business needs, furnish tools and products, and provide implementation support. The FHA serves a coordinating and convening role across the Federal agencies to support alignment of HIT investments. This has led to the CONNECT Gateway project, the Federal Health Information Modeling (FHIM) initiative, Federal Health Information Planning and Reporting (FHIPR) and other projects aimed at coordinating across Federal agencies. FHA initiated FHIM to develop a comprehensive, integrated set of standards that fully support health information interoperability, including semantic interoperability. Included in this initiative is information modeling, the goal of which is to produce a logical, health information model that supports semantic interoperability and that is built by harmonizing information from the Federal partners and standards organizations. FHA created the FHIPR initiative to provide health IT specific guidance to agencies for the purposes of planning health IT investments and reporting to OMB. FHA provides guidance for agencies to help them identify and select health IT solutions that align to national health IT interoperability guidelines and standards. Not funding this program would jeopardize the President's goal of ensuring that all citizens have electronic health records by 2014.","In 2011, FHA focused on delivering solutions that address vital national priorities for healthcare. For example, the CONNECT Gateway initiative is enabling Federal Agencies - and private sector organizations - to integrate their health information systems into the emerging Nationwide Health Information Network standards and services. In addition to CONNECT, FHA set out to operationalize the completed foundation of delivered products, strategies, plans, architectures, guidance, solutions, and tools that resulted from Federal Agency collaboration to advance the National Health IT Agenda. In FY11, FHA delivered several products, such as a Federal security strategy; a Federal health IT standard development organization plan; architecture for a Federal health information sharing tool; investment and reporting guidance; solutions to support implementation; and tools for reporting and progress measurement.","In FY12 and FY13, FHA will participate in the S&I Framework as each of its phases is developed and will also focus its efforts on measuring adoption of standard and specifications produced through the S&I Framework. The FHIM work will be transitioned into a shared model through the standards and interoperability framework, and will serve as one of the foundational elements of the S&I framework. This will include resources to support a services registry, and other resources that will decrease the barriers to interoperability across the federal partners.  *          FHA will align the Federal Health Architecture with NIEM's Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD) where applicable.   *          FHA will measure the adoption of meaningful use Stage 1 measures by Federal Agencies engaged in health delivery service functions.  *          FHA will document the transition to ICD-10 by Federal health IT investments, and will document risks and process changes that occur due to the transition.  *          FHA will be integrated with the Standards Development and Harmonization of Core Concepts phases of the ONC S&I Framework  *          FHA will initiate an effort to facilitate and encourage the use of modular architecture and openly available models of information, data dictionaries, and standardized vocabularies In addition, in FY12 and FY13, FHA will establish a governance structure to coordinate with the Federal partners, provide resources that will help Federal partners identify, use, and contribute to the meaningful use standards through alignment with and contribution to NwHIN standards and specifications and participation in data exchanges utilizing the NwHIN specifications and standards.  As the technical requirements for privacy and security are finalized by the rule making process, FHA will provide coordination and guidance of the standards, specifications, validation, and policies for these requirements to Federal Agencies  In FY12, FHA will continue to support the federal partners in implementing CONNECT releases and transitioning CONNECT to a distributed development model.",34.167,7.71,7.71,7.71,2004.0,2014.0,,"HHS Interim Acquisition Guidance Concerning Earned Value Management, dated October 1, 2008, does not require EVM for any contract less than $10M or for any firm-fixed price, time & materials,  labor hour, or term contract less than $25M.

The Program was authorized by OMB to proceed through the Department's EPLC process and includes: (1) expansion of budget tools, and (2) dashboard and business intelligence. These projects are limited to UFMS with no dependencies on other HHS investments. Enterprise architecture considerations were considered throughout the business case, including high-level definition of the projects proposed within this program. However, the HHS Office of Budget is in the early planning stages seeking to implement the Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS). We do not believe there is an overlap between DEBS and the Modernization program as the expansion of budget tools will interface with DEBS to provide program managers functionality spanning budget planning through budget execution.  The two projects proposed will create an information-driven Department, whereby HHS Programs will realize the following benefits: (1) enhancing the accountability and transparency of the Department and provide more financial management information in a cost effective manner, and (2) Create an environment where financial and programmatic data is synchronized centrally from UFMS.  This will in turn allow for more data analysis and managerial accounting concepts to be used and further centralize and strengthen the HHS Programs' ability to enforce compliance with regulatory policy while increasing operational efficiency.  Program Managers will be provided with enhanced reporting and data analysis capabilities in order to make fact-based operational decisions. Operational efficiency and agility of the HHS processes will be improved by further centralization and strengthening the Department as a financial management organization. Accomplishing this will directly reduce cost by reducing the number of redundant cuff systems, decreasing future system maintenance and upgrade costs, and system complexity.","This investment closes the gap between managerial and financial reporting and budget processing at the Operating Division level and the Department level.

While providing direct medical care to our patients is key, as the nation's largest research hospital, data collection and analysis for clinical trials is critical to improving the health of the nation.  CRIS is a system of multiple modules from Allscripts and is interfaced with many other applications to support the Clinical Center's mission of healthcare research.  CRIS has interfaces to multiple applications specific to departments such as radiology, nutrition, surgery, laboratory and pharmacy.  This integration provides a central source of data, images and reports for patient care givers and clinical researchers of the NIH intramural program.  With the core mission of the NIH as research, CRIS has enabled the intramural program to pool all patient data into one repository creating efficiencies and allowing researchers to analyze increasingly more complex data and results by protocol or across protocols. CRIS continues to meet goals set through a rigorous management oversight and CPIC process.  Budget requests are vetted through the CC ITAG and CC executive leadership.CRIS is supported through the NIH Clinical Center Data Center infrastructure as part of the overall NIH IT Infrastructure, which includes dependencies on the availability of power, cooling, network, etc.   The integration that allows for a central source for data is dependent on the ancillary, or department specific, systems that feed data into CRIS.","CRIS is the Electronic Health Record for the Intramural Program at the NIH.  The system is used for all ordering, resulting, and clinical documentation for patient and research care for over 350,000 patients, 80,000 of which are currently active. The system provides a mechanism to efficiently care for patients in a safe environment such as ensuring the right medication/test is provided to the right patient at the right time. The patient data from CRIS is fed to the BTRIS system which is the Research Data Repository.  As a research facility with the focus on 1400 research studies active at any one time the integrity of the data is critical to the analysis of the research hypothesis and the outcomes defined in the Protocol.

The scope of the NBS includes business or functional areas: Financial Management, Property Management, Accounts Payable (Commercial Accounts), Acquisition, Service and Supply Funds Operations, Supply Management and Travel Management. Implementing the NBS has yielded qualitative and quantitative benefits to the NIH because it enabled improved business processes and provides more accurate and timely information which better support the scientific mission of the NIH. The NBS benefits are as follows: Reduce the cost and complexity of doing business: Excessive routing and processing redundancies have been reduced by the workflow management capabilities of the NBS.  Increase service levels:  NIH must be more responsive to its customers, particularly its scientific staff.  The pace of science demands that NIH service and support organizations: Improve service delivery timeliness and predictability; Improve service quality by identifying and quickly resolving errors; and provide more accurate and timely information through more robust reporting tools.

It is the nation's only source of reliable national substance use data for the general population; its continuation will ensure that SAMHSA will comply with statutory requirements and Federal, State, and local agencies will have timely data available for release on an annual basis. The survey sample supports annual estimates of prevalence for the nation, the 50 States and DC. Information collected through the NSDUH has multiple applications: the study of the epidemiology of substance abuse/mental health and monitoring substance abuse/mental health trends and patterns are some of the critical data uses. The ability to respond effectively & efficiently to the changing dynamics of the drug culture is critical to successful prevention & treatment strategies. NSDUH data supports SAMHSA's Data Strategy, HHS Strategic Plan, HP 2010, GPRA, President's Annual Drug Control Strategy, and will improve PART review of SAMHSA's SAPT block grant program. The Confidential Information Protection & Statistical Efficiency Act included in the eGov Act of 2002 provides a uniform set of confidentiality protections to individually identifiable data collected. NSDUH also supports the PMA of expanded eGov with the elimination of door to door hand written surveys and the use of electronically collected & transmitted surveys. NSDUH is conducted using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing/Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (CAPI/ACASI). NSDUH must constantly adapt its methodology to adequately monitor the environment. Microsoft computing environments are used to support the surveys. Web servers, database servers, file servers, and FTP servers run a combination of Windows Server family operating systems, Unix, and Linux. Public web servers and corporate database servers run in clustered configurations to provide failover redundancy and high availability. NSDUH continues to face several challenges in conducting its survey including increased gas prices, immigration policies and other issues impacting data quality.","Not only does the NSDUH provide information on the incidence and prevalence of substance use required by Section 505 of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 290aa4), but by providing these incidence and prevalence estimates, the NSDUH data supports SAMHSA's Strategic Initiatives, HHS Strategic Plan, HP 2010, GPRA, President's Annual Drug Control Strategy, and will improve PART review of SAMHSA's SAPT block grant program.","The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) successfully completed data a collection cycle during the PY.

009-999990160,9,Department of Health and Human Services,0,Department of Health and Human Services,"Grants.gov provides a single website to find and apply for federal discretionary grants.  Previously, grant processes varied widely across agencies and programs, resulting in a complicated, burdensome, and costly methodology to find grants.  Grants.gov, mandated by the 2002 President's Management Agenda and Public Law 106-107, has transformed the federal grants environment by streamlining and standardizing public-facing grant processes, simplifying and improving the process for both grantees and grantors, and eliminating redundancies.Grants.gov provides over one million organizations, a single web site where they can find and apply for over $153 billion worth of grants distributed annually.  Grants.gov empowers smaller agencies with limited resources to improve the reach of their grant programs, and provides larger agencies with the benefit of process standardization, cost savings, and increased visibility.  The program is funded by the 26 Federal grant-making agencies, each providing support commensurate with its size according to a formula approved by the Grants Executive Board (GEB).  In 2010, Grants.gov focused on continuing operations with limited funding and increased usage.   These improvements included a major system hardware upgrade, new reports, improved login security controls and audits, and performance improvements.  In 2011 and 2012, Grants.gov will continue to focus on operations and maintenance, including implementing a disaster recovery capability in keeping with the increased system criticality. Many important enhancements desired by users such as collaborative grant applications are pending approval by the GEB.  Improvements to infrastructure software, submission validation, reports, and submission status tracking will be made as budgets allow.Grants.gov is currently engaged in conducting an analysis of how to incorporate new technologies to continue providing the same level of service at a reduced cost.   Moving to the Cloud would relieve Grants.gov of the costs inherent in maintaining a system, including equipment maintenance, upkeep, and refresh.  The analysis has identified several options within the Cloud Computing environment including repositioning the system partially within the Cloud, while maintaining some of the current environment.   Since the initial transfer and related costs are presently unknown, Grants.gov intends to update the information in the Summary of Spending Table for fiscal year 2016 at that time.","HHS carries out large portions of its mission through grants.  Grants.gov improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the grants process for 26 federal agencies including HHS and its components.  Efficiency is improved by providing a single, simple, Web-based mechanism for agencies to post grant opportunities, and by providing common forms and a common system for receiving grant applications electronically.  Effectiveness is improved by providing a single web site where the grants community can find and apply for grant opportunities, helping to ensure broad visibility of grant opportunities and participation from the most qualified and deserving grant applicants.  Lack of full funding for the investment will eliminate functional and operational improvements, which are needed to provide the stated benefits to additional grants programs, further improve the efficiency of the grant application process, and reduce long-term operations costs.  Significant reductions in funding would impact the ability to operate the system and provide existing services to 26 grant-making agencies and more than 100,000 grant applicants.","During FY11, Grants.gov provided ongoing operations that serviced more than 11 million Website visitors per month searching for grant opportunities and processed more than 200,000 application submissions.   In addition, Grants.gov made numerous improvements during FY11 through a controlled process of periodic releases.  Roughly 40 improvements were made in the areas of reliability and operability (CCR import, workflow, virus scanning, proprietary software removal, database optimization, etc.), security (password protection, account expiration, vulnerability patches, session timeouts, etc.), infrastructure (Oracle upgrade, search appliance update), usability (rejection comments), and functionality (bug fixes).   Grants.gov had requested from the Grants Executive Board to conduct an analysis of the feasibility of moving the system to the cloud; however the funding request was not approved.","Accomplishments planned for FY12 (subject to funding) include sustaining operations to service increased usage, plus a variety of application, forms, and application platform improvements to provide important features needed by users, better operability, and lower lifecycle costs.  Application improvements include complex (multi-organization) grant application support, improved opportunity searching, improved reporting, opportunity notification controls, website improvements, implementation of a web service for grant opportunity management, and various bug fixes.

FPLS aligns w/ & supports HHS goals to advance health, safety & well-being of the American people by promoting economic & social well-being of individuals, families & communities thru collecting support & assisting in obtaining health care coverage for children. FPLS enables Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to meet its & state child support program missions & increase collections by facilitating communication & data exchanges w/states, employers, multistate financial institutions, insurers & other federal agencies & using FPLS data to locate parents delinquent in support. FPLS is comprised of multiple systems, incl. 4 that are critical: National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), a database of employment data; Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders (FCR), a database of child support cases & orders; Debtor File, which assists states w/collection of delinquent child support; & Enterprise Services Portal (ESP), which provides authorized users a secure gateway into FPLS web applications. NDNH data matches resulted in national child support collections of about $428M in FY10, & FOP collected $2.1B. FPLS also supports HHS goals to increase efficiency, transparency & accountability by ensuring program integrity & resource stewardship & by fighting fraud, waste & abuse. FPLS data are used to reduce erroneous payments & costs in public assistance programs, contributing directly to government-wide initiatives to reduce improper payments. FPLS eliminates barriers between gov't agencies & promotes data sharing to improve program efficiencies & customer service by providing a centralized source of employment & location data for authorized programs. In FY09, SSA estimated benefits of NDNH matching of about $652M in prevention of future overpayments & adjustments of incorrect payment amounts in Supplemental Security Income. In PY10, IRS used FCR & other data to recover over $438M in additional taxes. HUD estimated the subsidy error in FY10 for rental housing assistance programs identified using NDNH data to be $203M. In FY08, NDNH data helped ED recover $1.3B in defaulted student loans. In CY10, DOL estimated benefits of NDNH & SDNH matching to be $183M, incl. identification, recovery & prevention of Unemployment Insurance overpayments. In FY11, FMS used NDNH & other data to recover about $27M in federal non-tax debt & $8M in payment agreement collections.","Because of its nationwide breadth & scope & the nature of the child support program it is characterized by a unique, comprehensive, partnership of federal, state & local gov't agencies, thousands of employers, financial institutions & insurers.  Our goals & challenges are inextricably linked across all partners & stakeholders.  OCSE faces the challenges of ensuring states have appropriate tools & resources to efficiently locate child support case participants, establish & collect financial support for children, while facilitating cost-efficient & effective information sharing across & among a disparate group of program partners.   CSEAs face the loss of already limited budget & staff resources.  Federal agencies have other priorities & budget & resource constraints that hinder their ability to provide support to the child support community.  Employers, financial institutions & insurers also have limited resources & budgets, & are often overwhelmed by the volume of requests for action from the child support community.  Critical program partners have been forced, because of resource issues, to leave extras like IT infrastructure & non-core customer support functions on hold. To facilitate achievement of OCSE, ACF and HHS goals in a technologically innovative & cost-efficient manner, & in response to the economic & resource crises facing our program partners & stakeholders, FPLS provides a variety of services, removing barriers to providing services to stakeholders & increasing the program's ability to provide the best customer service. HHS recognizes that FPLS is critical to its mission:  HHS recently identified FPLS to the OMB E-Gov Office as 1 of 4 Key IT investments that demonstrate how IT supports agency programs. HHS also selected a component of FPLS, Enterprise Services Portal, to be included in its Customer Service Plan, developed in response to E.O. 13571 requiring agencies to develop plans to identify their highest volume services focused on streamlining service delivery & improving customer experiences. HHS selected FPLS because it is comprehensive-focused on all OCSE customers, partners & stakeholders, supportive of the child support program mission, & provides effective, efficient & repeatable processes & systems at minimal or no cost to child support program partners. Failure to fully fund the FPLS will result in significant, negative impacts to the national child support program in general, & to children & families in particular.","In FY11 completed several projects focused on child support program lines of business:  *         Location: implemented on-line processes for location, income & asset info thru the Internet via FPLS Portal; developed on-line app & interface w/DoD to provide info to establish equitable child support orders for military. *          Collection & Enforcement: developed & enhanced apps to facilitate communications betw. CSEAs, employers & insurers to expedite income withholding & ensure CSEAs have prior knowledge of insurance payouts, employer bonuses or lump sum payments. *         Communication: provided real-time access to FPLS data w/design & development of Child Support Services & State Services Portals, adding Federal Offset App to portal, implementing QUICK SSN & e-Employer look-ups & MSFIDM Reporting & Exchange.  *         Research: established data mining & trend analysis tools thru development of the FPLS Research System & new releases for MICRS, a mgmt info system.","With the FPLS, OCSE has focused considerable effort in developing applications, processes and systems to facilitate electronic communications and information exchange among program partners and stakeholders. OCSE has identified specific objectives for the FPLS, including to: *         Create durable, repeatable mechanisms, processes and systems providing efficient, enhanced services *         Improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of child support services, ultimately increasing the frequency, amount and timeliness of collections *         Reduce administrative burden on employers, financial institutions, insurers and CSEAs by reducing or eliminating manual efforts to process documents and eliminating paper & postage costs *         Provide user-friendly communication mechanisms that give all partners and stakeholders immediate access to accurate and current information, resources and data.     Specific focus for the current and budget years will be on the FPLS Portal.  The Portal allows OCSE to easily add applications that promote use of FPLS programs and services and allows stakeholders to take advantage of FPLS programs with little to no resource drain.  It serves as a foundation for role-based, real-time access to select FPLS data and provides a secure, single entry point for state-authorized and -authenticated users to many FPLS applications and services. OCSE will continue to ensure that the FPLS Portal is a secure means of access to the FPLS systems by adding processes to facilitate Personal Identity Verification (PIV) to comply with the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and the Office of Budget and Management memorandum M-11-11.In addition to the Portal, OCSE continues working to develop and implement ever more useful and efficient mechanisms, such as Electronic Document Exchange (EDE), which provides a secure and cost-effective solution for CSEAs to electronically transfer imaged documents between intergovernmental jurisdictions.  All of these efforts assist states in effectively and efficiently achieving the ultimate mission of the child support program.

HCQIS shares and utilizes the infrastructure of this Quality Program investment.","As mentioned above, HCQIS supports HHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.3, improve healthcare quality, safety, cost and values.  HCQIS collects and maintains survey and certification and quality of care data on health care facilities.  Collection of this data is mandated by legislation and no other system provides users with this mandated information.  Data is maintained in a central location and allows CMS, State agencies and other users to access the data, as needed.  HCQIS compiles the data into formats that permit users to analyze and generate reports to determine if health care facilities are complying with Federal requirements.  This information allows surveyors to monitor whether facilities are adhering to Medicare rules and regulations.  HCQIS provides quality care data to providers, and enhances the healthcare quality and safety of beneficiaries. HCQIS provides public reporting information to consumers, such as data on the Nursing Home, Home Health, and Hospital Data Compare web sites.   If HCQIS is not fully funded, it will have an adverse impact on the survey and certification program and the quality of care provided to beneficiaries. The S&C program, which is legislatively mandated, is dependent on HCQIS. CMS will be unable to provide information on certification and quality of care for nearly all providers. CMS will have to terminate a myriad of activities in support of provider quality of care, including: ceasing collection and reporting of quality indicator measures data for nursing homes (NH) and home health agencies (HHA); closing down all CMS consumer information for NH, HHA, and hospitals on its Compare web sites; and ceasing collection of complaint data used by State agencies and Quality improvement Organizations.","In FY 2011, we incorporated and supported MDS 3.0.  This improved the tool's clinical utility, clarity and accuracy while maintaining the ability to use MDS data for quality indicators, quality measures and payment (resource utilization groups-III and IV [RUG-III/IV]).  CMS integrated and supported OASIS-C by introducing new streamlined process measures and refined existing data elements to more accurately capture improvement. In addition, CMS redesigned ASPEN Survey Explorer (ASE) and integrated the Quality Indicator Surveys (QIS) and ESRD STAR programs. ASE created a single, cohesive application framework that streamlined surveyor operations.  We continued to support the redesign of OSCAR and CLIA in HCQIS.  We incorporated and enhanced several OSCAR standard reports and integrated the CLIA data entry application while still maintaining the legacy system.  CMS obtained DHHS/CMS approval on Authority To Operate (ATO).","For FY 2012, HCQIS will support section 6111 of the ACA regarding the imposition and collection of civil money penalties by CMS when nursing homes are not in compliance with Federal participation requirements. We will incorporate the online CLIA Accounting functions and Lockbox processing in HCQIS; modify the assessment tools (HAVEN, IRVEN) to incorporate changes to the ICD-9 codes, Case Mix and Home Health Resource Groupers; revise MDS 3.0 and jRAVEN to include modifications to data specifications, Section S, item subsets, MDS 3.0 quality measures and RUG-IV; update the Resident Profile Table and History Tables for MDS 3.0. We will also begin a thorough analysis on MDS, OASIS and IRF-PAI to accept the new ICD-10 codes. QIES will support section 3004 of the ACA which requires a Quality Reporting Program for long-term care hospitals (LTCH), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) and hospices. CMS will revise OASIS-C to include modifications to data specifications, NQF endorsed quality measures and submission systems; continue support of the redesign of OSCAR and CLIA in QIES; integrate the IRF National Collection System into the Assessment Submission and Processing System (ASAP); and convert the IRVEN software application to a JAVA platform.  For BY 2013, CMS plans to integrate ASSURE into the current infrastructure; convert the existing CLIA Billing Batch jobs into HCQIS; continue to support the QIS and ESRD STAR programs; replace outdated State hardware and software to handle the expanding capabilities; modify existing functionality to provide expanding oversight on LTCH, IRF and hospices; incorporate the new ICD-10 codes; and support and maintain the current State infrastructure.",219.816,21.195,23.65,22.925,2001.0,2020.0,"The increase in funding is due to several factors including: maintaining multiple environments: increased costs associated with  implementation and operational issues of MDS 3.0; dramatic increases in costs for hardware and software licenses; upgrades to the infrastructure; upgrades to testing and development hardware; network support; system administration; security; security assessments; 508 compliance; ICD-10; complying with the Affordable Care Act, and modifying functionality.",,4,"Sound management controls are in place to sustain above average performance and mitigate risk.

009-000001468,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"The Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) is a national standardized financial program that began operation in 2005. HIGLAS is a component of the department-wide effort of Health and Human Services Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). UFMS is a business transformation effort designed to integrate department-wide financial management systems and operations by aligning the Department's businesses with modern technological capabilities. HHS will use UFMS to satisfy the three categories of financial management systems requirements mandated by the FFMIA. These are Federal financial management systems requirements and the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP); Federal accounting standards; and the United States Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. CMS continues to closely coordinate efforts with DHHS to ensure HIGLAS core financial data integration with UFMS. The unification of the systems is aimed at improving data consolidation and financial reporting capabilities for all of DHHS. HIGLAS is a single, integrated dual-entry and FFMIA-compliant accounting system that processes the mission critical payment calculation for Medicare benefits to Part A and Part B, Medicaid Grants, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for the entire nation. HIGLAS also incorporates internal CMS administrative program accounting transactions.  HIGLAS represents the consolidation of two major CMS projects within the office of the CMS Chief Financial Officer. The first project, the Integrated General Ledger and Accounting System (IGLAS) project, was initiated to improve the accounting and financial management processes used by CMS's Medicare contractors to administer the Medicare Parts A and B programs. The Medicare contractors' accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and several reporting processes were deemed in particular need of improvement. The second project was an effort to improve the agency's central administrative accounting and financial management processes. This project, referred to as the Financial Accounting and Control Systems (FACS) redesign, entailed a replacement of CMS's legacy accounting system and the systems that currently support its procurement, travel management, grants management, and asset management. These two activities were combined into the HIGLAS project.","The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) requires each Federal agency to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with federal financial management systems requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and the US Standard General Ledger at the transition level.  The CMS Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) supports the DHHS' FFMIA compliance goals of accounting for the total CMS payment dollars (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and CMS Administrative Program Accounting) to be processed through HIGLAS by FY 2012. HIGLAS also supports OMB Circular A-127 requiring that agency financial statements be the culmination of a systematic accounting process. The statements are to be produced by an accounting system that is an integral part of a total financial management system containing sufficient structure, effective internal controls, and reliable data. HIGLAS is paramount towards the ability of DHHS to retain a clean audit opinion as required by the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) Act.  The improvements and benefits attributable to HIGLAS include reduced costs due to elimination of redundant individual Medicare financial record systems, improvements in automated Medicare debt collection/referral activities, creation of audit trails for every Medicare transaction/payment/claim in HIGLAS, improved Medicare financial audit ability, and improved capability for CMS to more systematically and efficiently recover identified Medicare Contractor overpayments.  HIGLAS implementation has also resulted in better internal financial controls across Medicare contractor operations.  Implementation of HIGLAS has a significant and positive impact on the amount of additional interest earned (saved) in the Medicare Trust Funds.  HIGLAS supports the agency's strategic mission goal of accurate and predictable payments by strengthening financial management of the Medicare program.  HIGLAS allows for more effective and efficient financial oversight and reporting of CMS program and administrative accounting. If this investment isn't fully funded, HIGLAS transitions could potentially be impacted, thereby placing CMS at a higher risk of not being able to meet the Agency's FFMIA compliance goals, as well as jeopardize the Agency's clean opinion on the CFO Audit.","Through FY2011, CMS has deployed HIGLAS at 14 traditional Medicare FFS contractor sites and 19 Medicare Administrative Contractor (MACs) sites. At present time, the total amount of CMS dollars accounted for in HIGLAS is greater than 96%.  HIGLAS processes approximately 3 - 4 million payment claims nightly, acting as the system-of-record for all Medicare Parts A, B, C, D, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance plan payments nationally.  Daily payments are approaching $1.5 billion.  These numbers will increase steadily through CY2012.","During FY 2012, CMS anticipates reaching 100 percent of FFMIA compliance with the planned transition of 7 additional MAC sites onto HIGLAS, as well as the transition of the Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Contractor.  We will also continue supporting the production and application maintenance at the 33 MAC/legacy Medicare contractor entities that will be utilizing HIGLAS by the end of FY 2011.   In FY 2013, our current System Integrator contract expires and we plan to transition to a new services contractor.  In addition, we plan to rollout the remaining internal CMS Administrative Program Accounting functionality to HIGLAS users.  Upon full deployment of HIGLAS in FY 2013,  processing volume of claims are projected to be approximately 5.5 to 6 million per night.",1062.818,138.89,156.196,133.602,2000.0,2020.0,The Summary of Funding table has been updated to reflect the actual Operating Level for FY 11.  ,"Although earned value is not a contract requirement on all contracts, the HIGLAS program office uses a comprehensive performance-based system that applies earned-value techniques to monitor project achievement against baseline cost, schedule and technical performance goals for all work on the HIGLAS project.  The HIGLAS EVMS meets reporting and auditing requirements necessary to track and control a complex information systems development project.  The HIGLAS project uses several tools to provide an integrated performance based management system, including Microsoft Project 2000, Project Program Manager, Microframe Program Manager, Primavera P3E, Pert Chart Expert, WBS Chart Pro, and w/Insight EVM tools.

The primary goals of the IDR are to be the single repository that serves as the centerpiece of CMS' data needs and enable cross-functional analysis.  The IDR provides an organized structure for reaching the data through a consistent application of access policies, processes and procedures, common services, governance, and framework. The IDR enables CMS and its partners to access the data from a single trustworthy source. The IDR is currently integrating and loading data from various CMS systems consisting of Medicare Parts A, B, and D entitlement, enrollment and utilization data. The value of the IDR comes from the integration of this data with other data for quality improvement, research on outcomes and effectiveness of drugs, post-market surveillance, and other analytic efforts. Better access to data from all CMS healthcare programs will provide opportunities for other government and research organizations to use this same source data in their efforts to improve healthcare for the public. The IDR implementation strategy is phased, incrementally incorporating CMS data to provide better data to a broader user community. During FY 2010, the IDR reached milestone via the development and release of the integrated data model for all subject area. This achievement was critical in demonstrating that the IDR fulfills the Medicare to Medicare analysis requirements and that a fully unified architecture can be successfully created to extend analytical capabilities across CMS. The IDR loaded a new source of Provider Data -- NPI Crosswalk data. This investment enables reporting on summarized national claims history and empowers users to apply analytical analysis to Part B data. The IDR repository also commenced its support of the Electronic Health Records Demo System via the provision of demographic data. The IDR also funds a portion of implementation of initiative One Program Integrity that will use COTS technologies to support fraud & abuse detection. Additionally OnePI provides visibility into Episodes of Care and Prescription Drug Events.

The Agency works with the health care community to improve the quality and efficiency in beneficiaries' programs, services, and care, and to promote the fiscal soundness of an evolving health care system in the United States. Today, CMS uses significant data center capacity provided by industry to support the IT Infrastructure requirements of the agency. The Baltimore Data Center (BDC) and the two Enterprise Data Centers, EDC1 and EDC2 are key IT Infrastructure resources utilized by CMS to meet its overall mission. All three data centers are currently operated under two separate contracts which limits competition and impedes coordination across all three of these data centers. CMS will reconcile these issues by bringing the three aforementioned data centers and additional data centers, currently operated outside the auspices of the CMS, Office of Information Services, under the umbrella of a single procurement vehicle. Toward these ends, CMS proposes the development of a comprehensive Virtual Data Center (VDC) ID/IQ that will expand upon concepts garnered from the existing EDC ID/IQ and ESD ID/IQ models.

009-000002454,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"The Medicare Appeals and Hearings function ensures that the due process rights of beneficiaries, physicians and other suppliers who are dissatisfied with initial claims and service determinations and subsequent appeal decisions are protected under the Medicare program. In keeping with CMS' Strategic Plan Objectives to provide High Value Health Care as well as Confident and Informed customers, the appeals and hearings function is focused on improving beneficiary satisfaction with programs and services, increasing the usefulness of communications, and maintaining and improving CMS' position as a prudent program administrator and an accountable steward of public funds. In order to achieve a robust and enduring technical solution to all the appeals processing needs, the Medicare Appeals System (MAS) was awarded to a contractor in September 2003. The MAS design supports a unified case tracking system that facilitates maintenance and transfer of case specific data with regard to fee-for-service and managed care appeals throughout the four levels of the appeals process, i.e., Level 1 appeals: affiliated contractors, Level 2 appeals: QICs, Level 3 appeals: ALJs, and Level 4 appeals: the DAB. In developing the MAS, HHS and SSA worked together to capitalize on SSA's knowledge and experience in developing the case processing management system (CPMS) and avoid unnecessary duplication. In addition to basic case tracking across all levels of Medicare appeals in a unified system, the MAS provides the capability to report on appeals data, enable more accurate and expedient responses to Congressional questions, and provide more precise data for assessment and policy-setting. MAS fulfills these business needs by focusing on data collection, data analysis, and workflow management. The MAS is capable of docketing/calendaring hearings, scheduling expert witnesses for testimony, and providing information on the Medicare appeals workload as it relates to the number of ALJs and support staff required to process appeals. Moreover, the MAS envisions a future environment in which all of the management of the appeal files will be handled electronically. Specifically, the ALJ would have electronic access to all necessary documents, prior decisions, and other relevant information. MAS also supports fraud and abuse efforts because it now provides appeals outcomes and statistics to the Recovery Audit Contractors.","The Medicare Appeals System (MAS) ensures due process rights are protected under Medicare. The goal of MAS is to support the end-to-end appeals process for the Fee-for-Service, Medicare Advantage, and Prescription Drug Programs as mandated by: (1) The Beneficiary Improvement & Protection Act, (2) The Balanced Budget Act, (3) Final Rule CMS-424-FC, and (4) The Medicare Modernization Act.  The MAS is a system that tracks and records Medicare appeals through multiple levels of the appeal process. (Currently, MAS supports Level 2 and Level 3 appeals processing.) The system leverages processes and consolidates data to allow users across levels to realize benefits of reusable, centralized data. The system supports standard processing of appeals and availability of data to other levels while allowing stakeholders and user groups to shape procedures at their desired level.  If MAS is not fully funded, CMS will not be able to fulfill its legal and fiduciary responsibilities to provide due process rights to Medicare providers and beneficiaries as described above.","Prior Year (FY2011) accomplishments:  The MAS was successfully upgraded to Siebel version 8.1.1.3 to provide improved system performance and to facilitate planned MAS initiatives, e.g., Task Based User Interface (TBUI) for Level 3 (ALJ) Appeals; an Electronic Case File for Level 3 (ALJ) Appeals and MAS 508 Compliancy. Completed the planning and requirements phase for the e-Case File effort to allow Level 3 MAS users to process appeals using an electronic case file, reducing the time necessary to request, send, track, organize, print, and store the paper case file.   Completed the planning and requirements phase for the process-oriented Task Based User Interface (TBUI) for Level 3 (ALJ) Appeals to allow tasks to be presented to the user on the screen based on prior task completion or selection and to tailor MAS to fit the needs of the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA) business processes and workflows.","FY2012 & FY2013 Operation & Maintenance: Includes the implementation of 4-6 releases each year to support Business Owner Change Requests (CR); Support Tickets; CMS infrastructure changes; processing appeals; database maintenance; MAS User Support Desk; document scanning; daily monitoring & production support; etc. CMS also plans to complete the final development, validation and implementation of a fully 508 compliant version of MAS.FY2012 & FY2013 DME:e-Case File: Complete the end-to-end analysis and evaluation of the present appeals case file workflow and design of MAS to meet that workflow; Complete a detailed design document for the e-Case File module; Complete Develop, Validation, Testing and Installation of the e-Case File module for the MAS system; and provide training materials and training for OMHA ALJ staff in use of the e-Case File module.

009-000004062,9,Department of Health and Human Services,90,Departmental Management,"Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) Exchange is the critical portion of the National health IT agenda intended to facilitate development of a secure, nationwide, interoperable health information infrastructure that will connect providers, consumers, and others involved in supporting health and healthcare. The investment will enable health information to follow the consumer, be available for clinical decision making, and support appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care so as to improve health outcomes. The investment seeks to achieve these goals by coordinating stakeholders in developing interoperable standards and by engaging industry in developing prototypes and trials. Executive Order 13410 requires Federal Agencies to adopt health IT standards that have been recognized by the HHS Secretary when developing or enhancing health information systems.NwHIN Exchange represents the standards, services and policies necessary to support using the internet to exchange information in a secure and private manner. Initially established as a program under ONC in 2004, the goals of the NwHIN Exchange were to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by establishing a mechanism for nationwide health information exchange. The NwHIN Exchange went through a prototyping and trial implementations phase where an architecture and set of specifications were developed to provide a common, secure and trusted network to enable the exchange of health information among private networks and Federal health networks. The effort effectively integrated specifications, implementation guidelines, compliance, interoperability verification, and network operations with a strong trust fabric to allow for interoperable health information exchange. CONNECT Gateway is a Federal Health Architecture initiative to develop a software gateway to link Federal Agencies to the NwHIN Exchange. It was built in open source to keep the cost low and make the solution widely available. Other NwHIN Exchange participants are working with private sector technology partners to build gateways that instantiate the NwHIN Exchange specifications and protocols. They are successfully using these gateways to exchange health information with Federal Partners who use the CONNECT Gateway.","This investment will contribute to cost efficient health information exchange by streamlining the technical, policy and operational components necessary to participant in a trusted network. By negating the need to support complex and expensive point-to-point connections and legal agreements, the investment will accelerate financially viable health information exchange. Connectivity will be a key tool for getting the most out of health IT, supporting health information exchange and meaningful use at Federal, State and local levels. This investment will yield more complete health information that supports better informed decisions, which directly contribute to improved medical care for individuals. The ONC has developed and continues to develop a set of tools available that will aid organizations in implementing secure electronic health information exchange. These tools range from exchange and content specifications, implementation guidance, reference implementations and testing tools.  ONC produces these assets with help and participation from the broader Health Information Technology community to drive alignment within the community on standards-based, secure methods of exchange.  These assets are publicly available for download on the HHS website. These technical assets are resources that are used to support the wider HIT community in addition to the larger HIT community.  All of the work of the NwHIN Exchange is developed through an open, community driven process. Part of this process has developed specifications for directed exchange, and future work within the S&I in ONC will refine the blue button functions that will allow patients to download an electronic copy of their medical record.Not funding this program would jeopardize the President's goal of making sure all citizens have electronic health records by 2014.","In FY11, ONC continued to encourage the expanded use of CONNECT Gateway to link Federal Agencies to the NwHIN Exchange. The Gateway was built in open source to keep the cost low and make the solution widely available. Other NwHIN Exchange participants are worked with private sector technology partners to build gateways that instantiate the NwHIN specifications and protocols. Currently, the NwHIN is being used to support SSA, the VA, the DoD, CMS, MedVA, Kaiser Permanente and other signatories of the DURSA, including activities of the VLER project. Many State and Federal Agencies are using the NwHIN standards, services, and policies to enable them to meet the meaningful use requirements for exchange. In that way, the specifications of NwHIN Exchange are an enabler to other public and private organizations to satisfy the exchange requirements of meaningful use. They are successfully using these gateways to exchange health information with Federal Partners who use the CONNECT Gateway.","In FY12 and FY13, the priorities include the on boarding of new NwHIN Exchange members and providing the support needed for the network operations, transitioning the governance of the NwHIN to a private entity, and outreach and adoption activities are essential to establish the common network, refine directed exchange standards, specifications for provider directories, certification and authentication, and additional exchange specifications for meaningful use stage 2. Supporting bi-directional communication and messaging between providers and patients will be evaluated and prioritized with close coordination between the S&I framework within ONC. As the proposed modifications to the HIPAA Privacy & Security Rules for privacy and security are finalized, NwHIN Exchange will provide coordination and guidance of the standards, specifications, validation, and policies for these requirementsAll of the specifications in the NwHIN will be transitioned into the S&I framework within ONC and used to support Federal, and private sector standards based exchange.  Throughout this process, the terminologies and standards defined in NwHIN will be incorporated, and are in the process of being made operational within the NwHIN Exchange. ONC will continue to provide coordination and guidance of the standards, specifications, validation, and policies affecting the NwHIN and ONC will steward these operational aspects of the NwHIN until they are self-sustaining.",74.997,6.6,4.82,4.84,2005.0,2014.0,,"HHS Interim Acquisition Guidance Concerning Earned Value Management, dated October 1, 2008, does not require EVM for any contract less than $10M or for any firm-fixed price, time & materials,  labor hour, or term contract less than $25M.

009-000004258,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"HPMS manages the following plan enrollment processes for the Medicare Advantage and Part D (MAPD) programs: application, bid, and formulary submissions, marketing material reviews, plan oversight, complaints tracking, operational data feeds for enrollment and payment, and data support for the Medicare & You handbook and www.medicare.gov. HPMS supports these processes for all private plans in the MAPD programs. As the central e-government system for managing the day-to-day operations of these programs, HPMS ensures that there is a single mechanism by which plans and CMS can communicate electronically in a secure and efficient manner. With limited staff resources, HPMS is critical to CMS in managing the nearly 800 MA and PDP organizations to ensure that they are fulfilling the significant number of statutory, regulatory, and administrative requirements of the MAPD programs. The HPMS investment contributes to the Transform Health Care goal in the HHS Strategic Plan as well as to the Excellence in Operations and Improving the Care of Individuals goals of the CMS Strategic Action Plan. A primary mission of HPMS is to support the addition of new contract and plan choices to increase the accessibility and availability of drug and health plans to Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, HPMS functionality enables the agency to negotiate with plans for quality benefit packages at a reasonable cost to the beneficiary and the government. Finally, HPMS collects detailed plan benefit data for use in beneficiary education tools and provides for the review and approval of plan marketing materials. These activities ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to accurate and timely data and are well-prepared to select a plan that best suits their individual healthcare needs.This investment also makes significant contributions to an expanded e-government, implementation of the Federal Enterprise Architecture, and CMS' IT modernization blueprint. It builds the basic computing infrastructure needed to support several CMS systems; supports common standards and practices; and integrates security and privacy protections throughout the lifecycle. In addition to maintaining current operations, CMS will enhance the Plan Management Dashboard to add new key performance indicators for plan assessment, re-engineer the formulary submission process to gain efficiencies, and automate the review of retail pharmacy networks to strengthen the application review.","The HPMS investment closes the gap between the necessary annual plan enrollment lifecycle activities and the rigid timeframes in which these materials must be submitted by MA and Part D programs and reviewed and approved by CMS.  Without the HPMS automated processes, the submission and approval of these activities would be incomplete and inconsistent given the limited submission and review windows.   For example, the Health Service Delivery (HSD) review was previously done manually by CMS staff in different CMS regional offices, which resulted in inconsistent reviews of submitted applications.  No published standards were provided for MA organizations to ensure they were contracting with a sufficient number of providers and facilities to meet CMS' standards. With the automation of the HSD review, criteria has been published so MA applicants know the standards they must meet and all applicants are held to the same standardized review criteria.  CMS staff also now have time to further scrutinize other critical sections of the submitted application.  The Plan Benefit Package (PBP) tool provides standardized data entry so that MA and PDP organizations can describe their plan benefit packages, including information on premiums, cost sharing, authorization rules, and supplemental benefits.  The PBP software automatically generates the standardized sentences for the Summary of Benefits (SB) by using the plan benefit package data entered into the PBP software by the organization's user.  These standardized sentences are used by the MA and Part D organizations in their SB marketing materials and by CMS to generate plan benefits data for display in the Medicare & You handbook and on the www.medicare.gov website. Prior to the use of this tool, organizations submitted a narrative description of benefits, which had to be manually reviewed by CMS.  Data entry methods and terminology differed greatly across organizations.  No standardized sentences were generated and CMS staff had to manually create the data that displayed for the Medicare & You Handbook and on the www.medicare.gov website.  With the implementation of the PBP software, multiple review and standardization issues were resolved.","During the investment's prior year, the system was enhanced to include marketing surveillance.  This module provides CMS the ability to enter & review data in support of surveillance activities & effectuate compliance actions. Plans use this module to upload responses to deficiencies identified through marketing surveillance.   The HPMS investment made modifications to the Plan Management Dashboard, and included the integration of complaint metrics to monitor program performance.  The PBP software incorporated new cost share limitation rules, which reduced the number of non-compliant bid submissions by over 50%.The HPMS investment implemented  provisions outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub.L. 111-148) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub.L.111-152). This includes the collection & display of the Star Rating Quality Bonus Program, the Coverage Gap Discount program, & modifications to Direct & Indirect Remuneration data.","Planned accomplishments for the HPMS investment include streamlining the bid review process by incorporating external tools to calculate out of pocket costs and identify significant increases in cost-sharing or decreases in benefits for beneficiaries.  CMS will further enhance the Plan Management Dashboard for strategic planning, and will continue to refine the automated review of health service delivery tables.

HIPAA requires the Secretary of HHS to adopt a national standard identifier for all health plans and providers for use in the health care system. This scope extends to all heath plans and providers not just Medicare and Medicaid.  NPPES processes applications from health care providers for National Provider Identifiers (NPIs).  NPIs are identification numbers that health care providers are required by regulation to obtain and use to identify themselves in electronic health transactions, such as electronic claims and eligibility inquiries.  NPIs do not change and do not expire.  NPPES captures identifying information about health care providers.  It processes each application to ensure the uniqueness of the health care provider, and assigns the health care provider an NPI.  NPPES establishes a record for every health care provider it enumerates.  NPPES processes updates and changes to the data in an enumerated health care provider's record and deactivates and reactivates a health care provider's NPI upon request by the health care provider.  NPPES makes available, upon approved requests, information about each enumerated health care provider, including the NPI.  NPPES assists with reducing the incidence of provider misidentification.  It helps to differentiate between fraudulent providers and those who make honest billing mistakes.  It allows for easy access to obtain NPIs.  Finally, it supports defining, developing, implementing, and maintaining uniform data standards for the exchange of health care information in our programs, as well as across the nation's health care system.

009-000004611,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"This investment funds the Provider Enrollment and Chain Ownership System (PECOS), which is a national repository of all Medicare provider and supplier (p/s) enrollment data.  PECOS standardizes the Medicare enrollment process.  PECOS retains all information submitted by p/s and only requires updates to the initial enrollment data. The need for p/s practicing in multiple states or billing multiple Medicare Contractors (MC) to completely reenroll is eliminated. PECOS makes updating existing information easier, eliminates duplicate data entry and provides uniform data to the Fee For Service claims systems. PECOS enables MC reviewing enrollment applications to determine if an applicant was previously enrolled in Medicare and to identify all of the applicant's affiliations. PECOS improves the accuracy of enrollment data and ensures that only qualified p/s are enrolled with Medicare.  PECOS greatly reduces the amount of time needed to process provider enrollment applications.  By offering a more complete picture of p/s business operations, PECOS helps to ensure Medicare works only with reputable business partners. As a national enrollment database, PECOS significantly enhances fraud and abuse prevention and enforcement activities since it allows CMS and enrollment MC to view all Medicare activity of a particular p/s.  Fraud investigators have a complete national picture of a provider and its managers and owners, allowing them to check for patterns of fraud that cross providers and/or contractor jurisdictions. PECOS also identifies p/s who have been denied privileges, or are subject to revocations or exclusions. PECOS R7.0  has modernized the architecture of the administrative interface by moving it to the agency approved platform. PECOS R7.2  expanded PECOS to incorporate Durable Medical Equipment suppliers. Future releases will incorporate changes due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and requests from the agency wide PECOS user council.","As a national enrollment database, PECOS significantly enhances fraud and abuse prevention and enforcement activities since it allows CMS and enrollment Medicare Contractors to view all Medicare activity of a particular provider/supplier.

PECOS plans to implement the use of an E-Signature capability to replace the need for a wet signature, which currently creates a significant extra step for the provider community and slows down the enrollment process. This will allow the providers to complete the entire enrollment process online. PECOS also plans to implement the Digital Documentation feature which will allow providers to attach digitized supporting documentation, again streamlining the enrollment process. In addition, PECOS plans to provide a provider bulk upload capability to allow large providers to upload multiple enrollment applications via a single standardized file using a secure webpage. PECOS will also provide a feature, the Mass Modification tool,  to allow providers to  automatically make the same update across multiple enrollments. PECOS will also interface with an automatic screening tool currently being developed. PECOS will also be part of a provider portal effort that will allow an single entry point to all of the related applications.

The operational contracting offices used different systems and manual processes to support acquisitions, which complicated interfaces to financial and other HHS systems. To achieve its acquisition system standardization goals, HHS consolidated multiple configurations of HHS' COTS PRISM application. This consolidation effort is referred to as the HHS Consolidated Acquisition Solution (HCAS). HHS has deployed HCAS to the HHS contracting offices (excluding NIH, CMS, and CDC). The implementation of HCAS leveraged the Integrated Acquisition Environment e-gov initiative. HCAS was implemented on February 11, 2009. Operational and maintenance duties for the system were transferred to the Financial Enterprise Systems Management office  under the PSC.","This investment serves as an information resource and technology that is aligned with HHS' enterprise architecture to realize HHS' strategic goals and objectives.

009-000005234,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"The purpose of the One PI system is to establish an enterprise resource as a single source of information for all CMS fraud, waste, and abuse activities. The project will, for the first time, provide streamlined, centralized access and analysis for standardized Medicaid data across multiple states, integrated with data from Medicare Parts A, B, and D. The availability of a centralized source for accessing the tremendous volume of data on claims, providers, and beneficiaries will enable consistent, reliable, and timely analyses, improving the ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse in both programs. The project supports the HHS strategic initiatives, addresses legislative requirements, and will provide support to 3 systems in OMB's PART program: Medicare, Medicaid, and Health Care Fraud.  The project will allow for the efficient expansion of the agency's Medi-Medi data match project as required in the DRA of 2005. Centralizing Medicare and Medicaid data in this one system will create efficiencies for many of CMS's offices and their contractors along with different law enforcement agencies.  The effort supports provisions in the BIPA of 2000 and the Part D program components of the MMA of 2003. The program will meet a key functional goal of the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by providing increased tools to combat fraud, waste and abuse.  The HHS strategic initiative to Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship has been the primary goal of the modernization program since its start. The robust, integrated data sources developed by One PI will provide significant support to the efforts to Transform health-care by providing an analytic platform and reducing unnecessary costs. There is a dependency between the One-PI and the Integrated Data Repository (IDR) investment.  The program completed the process of migrating to the IDR in 2010 and 2011. The application suite consists of Medstat Advantage Suite, a COTS decision support tool used to perform sophisticated data analyses; Business Objects, a COTS suite of query and analysis business intelligence tools; portal collaboration and communication tools. In 2011, work began to bring SAS into the tool suite.","The One PI Business Case identified major challenges to fighting Medicare and Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse. There are many shortfalls of the existing data mining systems such as lack of standardization.  The contractor(s) and law enforcement's capabilities vary widely in terms of analytic capacity, data processing approach, and even the CMS data that are available to them. Another shortfall is within the tools being used to access the data.  The contractor(s) and law enforcement's current process lack of means for easy cooperation and sharing; multiple analysis tools resulting in inconsistent outcomes; multiple sources of data; multiple and varied analysis processes resulting in inconsistent outcomes.  Finally, there was a lack of, or disparity in, measurable success criteria.  The One PI system is designed to modernize CMS' approach to combating fraud, waste and abuse and address each of the challenges. Contractors will all have access to in depth, current data that many do not have access to today. For the first time, integrated data across all parts of Medicare will provide a comprehensive picture of providers or beneficiaries. The new data model, developed by One PI in partnership with the IDR, also supports the integration of Medicaid data. Data on episodes of care and episodes of admission can be used to see variations in treatment and cost across the nation or in particular areas or for specific providers. The new tools available to all users, allow standardized reports or complex queries to be made available to all contractors. The reduction in time running routine reports and queries will allow analysts to concentrate on innovation approaches to investigating fraud, waste and abuse. One PI also provides a collaboration capability that will allow analysts to share methodologies and to build on each other's work.If this investment is not funded, the loss of funds to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, which has been estimated by DOJ to be as high as 10% of expenditures, will continue at current levels. The PI contractors efforts will continue to be limited to disparate, inconsistent data with no ability to perform national analysis.","One PI was primarily in an O&M state in FY11, but significant progress was also made in the areas of tools, application upgrades which included new features and extensions, access to data, and training.

009-000005315,9,Department of Health and Human Services,10,Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring the safety of FDA regulated products in order to protect and promote public health. Analysis of adverse event and safety report information is critical to achieving this goal. The FDA needs to modernize its aging systems, improve its analytic capabilities, and make it easier for the public to submit adverse event and safety reports to the FDA.  FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) is a Web-based Oracle database application and Business Intelligence data warehouse that will replace legacy AERS (Adverse Event Reporting System).  FAERS will contain post-market adverse event reports associated with drugs and biologic products.  These adverse event reports are submitted to FDA by manufacturers, healthcare professionals, and consumers.  FDA will use FAERS for regulatory compliance, and to monitor for adverse events and medication errors that might occur with approved products.  FAERS is an Oracle operational database. Operational databases can store large amounts of data, and allow users to quickly enter, revise, and retrieve information from one system.  When FAERS replaces AERS, FAERS will contain more than six million adverse event reports, and the dataset will continually change as new reports or follow up information is entered into the database.","FAERS directly supports Federal mandate to collect adverse event reporting as defined in 42 CFR 310.305, 314.80, 314.98 and 600.80. This effort supports the goal of e-Government by creating consolidated and efficient electronic access to adverse event reporting information. This, along with the system's capabilities of accepting adverse event reports, facilitates real-time transfer of information, improves the FDA's responsiveness to the American public, consumers, industry, and healthcare providers. FAERS provides enhanced analyses to support safety evaluators and other Agency medical officers with appropriate tools to conduct analytic processes and reporting. This will be accomplished through a robust adverse event report system enabling daily decision-making, on-demand adverse event reporting by safety evaluators and medical officers. FAERS will provide consistent and prompt adverse event reports to the user community, Congress, FOIA, health care industry, manufacturing organizations, as well as a host of other external stakeholders. FAERS will subsume a myriad of aging legacy and disparate systems, ultimately providing enhanced capabilities for adverse event reporting.  This System provides a technology upgrade in both hardware and software to meet the growing demand of functionality and performance from business. The Enterprise Architecture of FAERS provides the optimal platform for continued program expansion, such as the expanded automation of data mining and ongoing safety issues to support Federal mandates. This investment facilitates a robust pharmacovigilance and analytic process for adverse event reporting and tracking. Disparate systems will be subsumed by FAERS. As a result of FAERS, business processes will be streamlined, creating efficiencies in work-flow processes for its user communities.  This project seeks to bridge multiple gaps within the CDER and CBER adverse event reporting domain. This project seeks to create a higher level of adverse event consistency, as well as data integrity. If this project is not fully funded, adverse event reporting will be compromised and user communities will not be able to efficiently and effectively analyze, report and track adverse event reporting.","Accomplishments for CDER/CBER in FY11 include Release 1.0 containing drug class queries, 15-day reporting, workflow & analysis for lipid lowering drugs; Release 2.0 containing Data Entry, eSub, Dictionary Mgmt, select reports and two Oracle COTS patches.

RBIS supports all FDA Field activities including domestics, imports, and enforcement.  It aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food and medical product safety and enables FDA Centers to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality and Safety of Manufactured Products and the Supply Chain. RBIS includes  1 Online Reporting, Analysis, and Decision Support System (ORADSS): a centralized data warehouse and reporting structure focused primarily on data availability for historical information.  2 Firms Master List Services (FMLS): a master, authoritative source focused primarily on data quality for approximately 5 million foreign and domestic firms which produce products regulated by the FDA.The reporting and firm information are used throughout the ORA work flows to support import screening, inspections, investigations, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, recalls, case management, other compliance activities, and work planning.  This information is used both to support every-day operations and to analyze and plan for the future.Primary beneficiaries of RBIS are the FDA personnel who access these integrated systems for analysis and decision-making that is used to protect public health and safety and communicate to the public. FDA management also benefits from the information RBIS provides to help in planning and identifying risks. Over 6,000 users throughout FDA use RBIS.RBIS is closely coupled with two other major ORA investments, ALM and MARCS.  ALM provides functionality for ORA laboratories and quality.  MARCS is the primary IT system for all regulatory activities outside of the labs and quality. Together, these three investments provide for all of the regulatory workflows of ORA.RBIS also interacts with FURLS, eLIST, and a number of smaller systems at FDA. In addition, RBIS interacts with Dunn and Bradstreet (D&B) information so that FDA can access the large data set of firm information held by D&B to improve domestic and foreign firm data quality.","RBIS fills the current performance gap by providing for 1 Standardized access to reports and other historical information. ORADSS contains a centralized data warehouse that includes subsets of information pertaining to particular activities. This is made available to non-technical users via COTS solutions. Users can access canned reports or create ad hoc reports without needing specialized knowledge of the underlying data structures. This allows the data to be made available to the largest possible user audience. More advanced users can query the data warehouse directly to support data mining and analysis.2 Standardized firm information that allows for reliable firm identification.  FMLS contains information on some 5 million firms. FDA must maintain information on companies around the world that manufacture, produce, or process regulated items. Within this universe of firms, there are always new companies, companies going out of business, and companies that are merging. FDA receives approximately 10,000 new or unrecognized firms per week. Sometimes these are not new firms, but firms that FDA already has in its database that need to be matched. This is especially true of foreign firms in nations that do not utilize a Latin alphabet. FMLS is continually used to match, clean up, delete, merge, and unmerge firm names in order to provide FDA with an accurate list of the firms that are producing regulated items. This is accomplished through using a set of rules to manage firms, fuzzy logic, and manual analysis. This emphasis on the data quality of the firms tracked by FDA supports all of the regulatory workflows of ORA.If RBIS is not fully funded then data availability, data quality, or both will suffer. The functionality provided by RBIS is closely tied to that provided by ALM or MARCS.  Information generated in ALM or MARCS will find its way into RBIS.

009-000005317,9,Department of Health and Human Services,10,Food and Drug Administration,"The MARCS program is the primary IT mechanism for realizing ORA program goals that supports all FDA Field activities (except laboratories) including domestics, imports, and enforcement.  MARCS directly supports the surveillance and promotes the safety of all FDA regulated products except tobacco. It also directly supports the programs of the FDA Offices OF, OMPT, and OGROP, and FDA Centers CBER, CDER, CDRH, CFSAN, and CVM. MARCS is a Business Process Improvement (BPI) effort built from the ground up with integration in mind and forms an Enterprise Resource Planning system that spans all of the electronic work flows of ORA except for processes specific to ORA laboratories. It aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food and medical product safety and enables FDA Centers to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality and Safety of Manufactured Products and the Supply Chain.  FDA uses MARCS to: plan FDA field activities and assign staff to inspections, investigations, recalls, and other compliance activities; track and control samples and the results of laboratory analysis; collect and maintain information from field activities; collect performance data, particularly that related to FDAAA; send Prior Notice for food imports to Customs and accept import product information from Customs for screening; screen some 20 million import lines a year based on calculated risk (PREDICT); collect information about the facilities FDA regulates and those in the import supply chain for risk-based targeting; provide FDA Centers with information on inspections, compliance actions, recalls, laboratory analysis and facilities.   Primary beneficiaries of MARCS are the FDA personnel conducting surveillance and regulatory activities.  This extends to the public as MARCS enables these surveillance and regulatory activities.  MARCS is closely coupled with two other major ORA investments, ALM and RBIS.  ALM provides functionality for ORA laboratories and quality.  RBIS provides reporting and information on some 5 million foreign and domestic firms.  Together, these three investments provide for all of the regulatory workflows of ORA. MARCS also interacts with FURLS, eLIST, and a number of smaller systems at FDA.","Because much of the data and work conducted by the FDA Centers converge within ORA, ORA faces a particular set of performance gaps - e.g., the ability to integrate data in various formats with divergent data definitions; work flows that begin in a number of different states and progress through various organizations; functionalities that are divided into different systems; and the fragility of point-to-point integration schemes that have been built up over time.MARCS is a complete departure from the past which was characterized by organic growth in response to particular needs without an ability to consider the holistic Agency needs. MARCS is being built from the ground with SOA using an ESB coupled with a BPMS and technologies to support offline and Remote Access Device (RAD) usage. SOA allows MARCS to build and reuse functionality that in the past has been duplicated multiple times with different implementations. Now, functionalities can be shared both across MARCS and with other related programs including ALM and RBIS. The ESB solves the problem of fragile point-to-point integration resulting in more robust and higher performance systems. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows. This also brings the building and modifying of work flows closer to Federal business personnel as the graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a much more accurate and useful work flow in the final product and shortens times to modify work flows. MARCS is producing shared services in accordance with point 6 of the 25 point IT reform plan.Much of the work performed by ORA personnel is done in remote areas without network connectivity. This has never been comprehensively addressed by ORA.  MARCS is designed to inherently support off-line/on-line operations through RADs - handheld devices that will improve the efficiency of field staff in completing work not done in an FDA office and when connectivity may be intermittent. MARCS is doing a holistic RADs implementation based on field integration and infrastructure requirements.If MARCS is not fully funded, then the movement towards this future structure will be delayed and work will need to continue to support poorly performing systems that keep breaking down as more demand and integration is placed onto them.

009-000005318,9,Department of Health and Human Services,10,Food and Drug Administration,"ALM encompasses QMiS, eLEXNET, and LIMS. It provides for ORA wide program quality, sample analysis information sharing across ORA and with external partners, and increased throughput via laboratory automation. ALM aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food/medical product safety; and to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality/Safety of Manufactured Products/Supply Chain. QMiS supports program quality across FDA. This includes the review, continuous improvement, and auditing of work product from the regulatory work flows of ORA. QMiS also directly supports the accreditation of the 16 ORA labs. eLEXNET allows the exchange of lab analysis data between over 100 public health labs at the Federal, state, and local levels including an interface with DHS' National Bio-surveillance Integration System. It is the system for the Food Emergency Response Network and is thus an integral piece in protecting against bioterrorism. LIMS is an envisioned ORA wide COTS solution for automating laboratory work that is currently done manually. This will significantly increase throughput and is expected to at least double the current capacity of ORA laboratories. This is a key component to supporting the FDA Science Strategic Plan. Primary beneficiaries of ALM are quality managers, organizations participating in eLEXNET, and the personnel in the ORA labs. This extends to the public as ALM enables protecting and promoting the public health.ALM will result in reduced response times in health emergencies due to increased laboratory throughput and leveraging external partners and in increased quality for repeatability of results and directly supports the ORA mission of protecting and promoting the public health.ALM has significant dependencies on both MARCS and RBIS for work flow and reporting.ALM forms a comprehensive solution for sample analysis that incorporates quality, internal laboratories, and external partners. It is a proven success in leveraging external partners through cooperative agreements and a useful and reliable IT system.ALM has a planned end date of 9/30/2014. FDA is exploring the possibility of combining ALM, MARCS, and RBIS into one investment since together they support ORA regulatory work flows. This analysis will be completed in FY12. ALM is now being reported as ending pending the results of this analysis.","ORA is a geographically dispersed organization with many processes having grown up organically over decades. QMiS addresses these differences by using a systematic approach towards quality and standardization. This involves a cultural change within the organization and will take time to be accepted.  eLEXNET provides a proven method of interfacing with external partners, particularly DHS. In the case of a bioterrorism emergency, cooperation between Federal agencies and private partners will be paramount. eLEXNET provides a robust, fully redundant, and reliable system to do this.  ORA has seen a steep growth in the demand for sample analysis while many essential processes are not yet automated. All of the 16 ORA laboratories use manual paper based processes.  LIMS is being implemented to change this to automate the laboratories from top to bottom. This will increase accuracy, throughput, and staff efficiency. The demand for sample analysis work from the ORA laboratories is only expected to grow.  Without an automated system, it will be virtually impossible for laboratories using manual processes to meet the needs of the organization.  eLEXNET was the first system at FDA to take a SOA approach coupled with a BPMS. Both LIMS and MARCS are being designed to extend this approach. This provides ORA with an architecture that supports integration and information interchange from the ground up. SOA provides the technical backbone for this approach. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows and enables Federal business personnel to build and modify work flows as graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a more accurate and useful final product work flow and cuts modification time.  ALM fills the current performance gap by providing improved quality, external partner communications, and laboratory automation. This improves repeatability, communication, addresses chain of custody legal needs, increases laboratory throughput, and reduces response time to public health emergencies.  Not fully funding ALM will delay these benefits and could result in ORA laboratories not being able to process samples as needed by the organization.","PY accomplishments:eLEXNET: continued implementation of extranet based/externally hosted service sharing real-time food safety information system for proactive collaboration with federal/state/local government labs. 24x7system availability with help desk support O&M plus security, troubleshooting/problem resolution incorporating National Biosurveillance Integration System and Electronic Laboratory Exchange Network (NEIS) -interface with DHS' National Bio-surveillance Integration SystemStandardized data web-based interfaces Design/Pilot - common login QMIS: Deployment of first release.

009-000005323,9,Department of Health and Human Services,10,Food and Drug Administration,"The UFFRS investment supports the Division of User Fees (DUF) within FDA's Office of Financial Management (OFM). DUF is responsible for managing User Fees in compliance with the OMB Circular A-25 other relevant Legislative or Executive actions. Investment business functions include Fee collection, accounting, and reporting of the approximately $3,000,000,000 collected annually in user fees. It also includes automated support for FDA strategic planning, budgeting, and budget execution that depends on the successful collection and distribution of mandated user fees.  UFFMS functions directly enable compliance with the following legislation: Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA); Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA); Color Certification (CERTS); Exports Certificate (Exports); Medical Device User Fee Act (MDUFMA); Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA); Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA); Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco).Contracts that support UFFRS operate, maintain and enhance three systems that collectively support the spending plans for the User Fee program and associated 5 year plans, and prepare the cost reporting needed to ensure statutory triggers are met. Contracts that support UFFRS operate, maintain and enhance three systems that collectively support the spending plans for the User Fee program and associated 5 year plans, and prepare the cost reporting needed to ensure statutory triggers are met.   1) The User Fee System (UFS) processes accounts receivable for user fee invoicing, collections, reconciliation with UFMS and detail reporting. 2) FDA's Hyperion reporting system captures data at a summarized level, rather than at an individual transaction level.  It is used to project the impact of User Fees FDA budgets, obligations, and expenditures. 3) The Business Intelligence Reporting System (BIRS) supports managerial reporting needs including web assess to user fee information.  BIRS uses Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition Plus (OBIEE) to provide business visibility and insight into the collection and use of User Fee revenues.  UFFRS systems interface with HHS' Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) for both payment related processes, budget management and report generation, and changes to UFMS operations or features must be reflected in the UFFRS systems.","FDA's regulatory mission could not be met without the fees mandated by User Fee legislation and collected, managed and reported through UFFRS. The fees processed are a significant portion of FDA's budget. Many FDA missions would suffer if user fees are tracked from collection to work performed. Three quarters of the annual investment budget is for O&M activities that support user fee management. They include:- licenses support from the COTS vendors and technical upgrades to the COTS product to maintain our vendor support agreements; - software upgrades to remain compliant with increasing security requirements and FDA's Production environment;  - help desk support; operation of the critical interfaces with UFMS including nightly extract, transfer, and load activities (ETL); - ongoing training, and changes needed to retain compatibility with UFMS. The cost for such support is reflected in the recently awarded contracts for fixed price operational support for the next five years. Although UFFRS meets current requirements, the user fee environment has been and continues to be dynamic. Changes expected in the next three years include: full implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act; actions on Generic Drugs that will affect User Fees collections; demands for integrating additional data sources to improve the capabilities of BIRS; and a planned Oracle database upgrade. Changes to the FDA budget may require realignment that will trigger additional forecasting and reporting needs since User Fees are a significant source of FDA revenues; UFS, BIRS and Hyperion will require modification. Estimates for these costs are included in the new contracts.The ability to collect and adequately track and report approximately one billion dollars in revenue generated by user fees is critical to FDA and to HHS. Failure to maintain the automated capability to ensure adequate collection and accountability would have a serious negative impact on FDA. Comprehensive requirements for reporting are included in the legislation which FDA must meet to satisfy Congress and industry, as well as the general public. In addition, significant cuts could require partial or total termination of current contracts. The User Fee program is a valued source of revenue for FDA and many of its programs.  Cuts to the UFFMS investment which would make it less able to collect and manage User Fees  would be counter-productive at best.","In addition to transitioning to new vendors on FFP contacts, accomplishments include: 1) BIRS. Improved automation through scripts to increase the efficiency of automated stakeholder notification of ETL success; substantially improved query response time on multiple reports (e.g. decreased time from > 5 minutes to < 1 second); additional reports to address OFM Director needs, e.g. AR reconciliation, Treasury Account Symbol reporting.2) Hyperion Planning. Consistently executed data loads; improved communications with Data Center through updated troubleshooting processes and increased frequency of interaction; eliminated of bugs in existing Hyperion reports.3) User Fee: Migrated Lockboxes to US Bank for 7 programs; automated Congressional reporting, Billing Solution, and Un-earned Revenue for MDUFMA; implemented Priority Review Voucher (PRV) for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD); automated refund processing, incorporating automated refund status report and variance reporting.","As noted in response to Question 2, all UFFRS systems are in the Operations and Maintenance phase of their lifecycle. Three-quarters of the annual UFFRS budget is for O&M activities. The primary objective for FY12 and FY13 is to maintain at least the current standards of performance for existing services and, where possible, to improve them as was done in FY11. Operational services required by the new User Fee System contract include: 1) operations, support, and maintenance and 2) operational and financial reporting, and financial management. Services contractually required for BIRS include support and maintenance including data extracts, transfers, and loads (ETL) from HHS' UFMS, system monitoring and trouble-shooting, customer service and security support. Services required for Hyperion also include data loads, customer and security support, and maintenance services. Planned operational improvements include: Incorporating the application(s) into an automated ticketing system, Automating configuration management, and Improving the process for migration of data form development to test to production. Planned and probable enhancements include those needed to adapt to changes in business and/or the FDA technical environment. Significant challenges include responding to food safety legislation, actions on generic drugs that will affect User Fees collection, demands for integration of additional data sources to improve the capabilities of BIRS, and the planned Oracle upgrade. Congressional actions may also require budget realignments that could trigger additional forecasting and reporting needs since User Fee dollars are a source of FDA revenues. Two of these enhancements were started in FY11 and will continue into FY12: 1) FSMA legislation passed in 2011 authorized FDA to begin collecting fees for issuance of export certificates for animal feed and food product. To comply with FSMA, the User Fee systems need to be enhanced to collect fees for food and animal feed export certificates and to report related financial impacts. 2)Because FDA OIM is upgrading its database to Oracle 11g the User Fee system and its associated Rapid DataMart must also be upgraded.

009-000005345,9,Department of Health and Human Services,10,Food and Drug Administration,"The Automated Drug Information Management System (ADIMS) is being developed as an integrated, fully electronic information management system for the receipt, validation, evaluation, reporting, and dissemination of drug application, safety and efficacy data. As the core enterprise architecture for FDA's pre-market drug review process, ADIMS aims to integrate or replace all relevant systems. The system will seamlessly unify multiple applications into one application which will include single sign-on access to information and tools used in daily decision-making. The Document Archiving, Reporting, and Regulatory Tracking System (DARRTS) will be the backbone of the system. Over fifty large and small systems will be integrated into ADIMS, including the Corporate Oracle Management Information System (COMIS), the Electronic Document Room (EDR), and the Division File System (DFS).  As the volume of technologically advanced electronic information coming into FDA escalates, the need for a robust information management system becomes more critical. In addition to facilitating the drug review and approval process, this integrated data management system will collect and evaluate electronic clinical data and facilitate the identification of trends and other important drug regulatory review information (e.g., potential product safety issues). Also, the validation and back-up capabilities of ADIMS will facilitate data verification and correction with increased efficiency. Consolidating current stovepipe and stand-alone drug information systems into a cohesive, easily supportable platform will give reviewers the ability to access information from a single interface, thus reducing redundancy. This will improve data quality and performance objectives, as well as reduce time and resources required to keep multiple systems updated. As a result, ADIMS will directly support the e-Government initiative by creating efficient, electronic access to current and complete information within the Agency. ADIMS also supports the HHS strategic goal to improve health care quality, safety, cost and value by allowing real-time transfer of information. In addition to this, the capability to accept electronic submissions will improve the FDA's responsiveness to consumers, industry, and healthcare providers.","ADIMS directly supports the goal of e-Government by creating consolidated and efficient electronic access to the most up-to-date and complete information within the Agency.

009-000006796,9,Department of Health and Human Services,38,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services (CMS) is required to risk adjust payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) Organizations and other entities (MAO) for nearly 12 million beneficiaries enrolled in MAOs.  The current Risk Adjustment Processing System collects 5 data elements for risk adjustment.  Since CMS doesn't collect MAO enrollees' expenditure data, it has been establishing risk coefficients based on Original Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims diagnosis and cost data.  Thus, coefficients used for payment are not the same as those that would be calculated if CMS used MAO-based diagnosis and cost data.  MAOs do not report diagnoses (and perhaps cost) in the same patterns as FFS providers, thus risk scores are overstated and MOAs are overpaid. Without data on the full range of services MAO enrollees receive, CMS is also limited in its ability to review the MA program annual contracting bids and conduct comparative effectiveness research.  The FY 2009 rule (73 FR 48650) reasserted CMS' authority to collect data from MAOs.  Consistent with this authority, CMS will require MAOs to submit encounter data for dates of service January 3, 2012, and later. This date is consistent with the current industry movement towards standardization of data collection formats, common edit modules, transition to ICD-10 diagnosis and HIPAA compliance measures. This investment will develop and implement a new Encounter Data System (EDS) to collect MAO beneficiary per-visit health care encounter data using the HIPAA 5010 version of the X12 standards; and it will edit, price and store the data.  The EDS will enable calculation of new risk coefficients that will more accurately reflect the demographics, patterns of care, and the predicted costs of diseases for MAO enrollees. This will result in more accurate risk adjustment data to provide to the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx) for monthly payment calculation for payments to MAOs. The EDS data will also enable analysis of health care utilization and will enable service utilization and quality comparisons across the original Medicare and MA programs. This will result in more accurate payments to plans, and enable value-based purchasing initiatives-thus supporting the HHS Objective 1.3-Improve health care quality, safety, cost and value.","CMS is required to risk adjust payments to MAOs that provide the Medicare Advantage benefit.  Currently, CMS does not collect utilization and cost data from MAOs in the Medicare Advantage program and is not able to identify items and services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program.  Thus CMS cannot risk adjust based on MAO utilization and is not able to analyze the effectiveness of the MA program.  This investment will develop an Encounter Data System (EDS) that will collect MAO beneficiary per-visit encounter data and estimate prices based on FFS rules.  The EDS will enable calculation of new risk coefficients that will more accurately reflect the demographics, patterns of care, and the predicted costs of diseases for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program to support risk adjusted payments.  The EDS data will also enable analysis of health care utilization and will enable service utilization and quality comparisons across the original Medicare and MA programs.  This will result in more accurate payments to plans, and enable value-based purchasing initiatives-supporting the HHS Objective 1.3-Improve health care quality, safety, cost and value.  The data will enable:*       Calculation of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH ) payments*       Quality review and improvement activities including service utilization and quality comparisons across the original Medicare and MA sectors*       Medicare coverage analysis  In FY 2010, we gathered the business and system requirements, completed the business process model for the design for data collection, editing, and storage, and initiated development of the front end system to receive encounter data. If the investment is not fully funded, CMS will not be able to complete the development, testing and validation for the encounter data ICD 10 based processing and pricing.  CMS will not be able to prepare the MAOs for the implementation and use of ICD 10 in the EDS as required on October 1, 2013.  CMS will not be able to roll-out the Encounter Data System in FY 2012.   CMS will have no insight into healthcare utilization of the 25% of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program.  MA scores will continue to be based on FFS utilization patterns with subsequent risk to the accuracy of the MAO and other entities payments.","In FY 2011, we completed the business requirements and rules in the requirements document, completed the business process model for the design for data collection, editing, and storage. We initiated development of the front end system to recieve encounter data in the 5010 X12 and completed a front end system pilot test using the current 4010 X12.

The project comprises updates to HIPAA versions 4010A1 and NCPDP 5.1 in addition to modernization activities to improve efficiency & data quality as well as reduce errors in claims processing, accommodates subsequent implementation of ICD-10 codes required for claims processing systems.HIPAA mandated that all covered entities (providers, payers, clearing houses, etc.) that submit and/or receive claims, and associated administrative transactions electronically, use ASC X12 N version 4010A1 and NCPDP version 5.1 industry-standard formats for these transactions.  The new 5010 and D.0 formats contain more clearly defined data enabling better qualitative analysis of risk and outcomes, and clearer, more consistent instructions to providers for the use of the transactions. A significant change included in this HIPAA version upgrade is expanding the field size of diagnosis and procedure codes in claim transactions, which will allow for implementation of ICD-10 codes. HIPAA 5010 also allows for HL7 (Health Level 7) clinical data attachments, such as electronic health records. This project funds HIPAA/NCPDP version upgrades across the agency, and will coordinate the testing and implementation of the changes. The systems impacted are categorized in three groups: 1) Front End systems used by the MACs to receive, edit, translate, account for, balance and return the claims, 2) The core systems that adjudicate the claims, cross them over to secondary payers, and send payment data, and 3) Downstream systems that use or house claims data. In addition to the HIPAA version upgrades, the projects will 1) minimize the number of invalid or incomplete claims from entering the adjudication systems, 2) implement accounting processes to ensure all claims can be followed throughout their life cycle and 3) standardize MAC front ends to significantly improve consistency in their processing and error handling of claims. This investment supports the Health Domain IT Principle: Management of data as an enterprise asset and the Federal Health IT Policy Principle: Share health information between providers to enable better care.","The CMS 5010 Conversion Initiative has been responsible for determining the systems impacted by the replacement of HIPAA claim standards throughout all of CMS' Medicare systems. The systems impacted can be categorized in three groups: 1. Front End systems used by the MACs to receive, edit, translate, account for, balance and return the claims; 2. The core systems that adjudicate the claims, cross them over to secondary payers, and send payment data; and 3. Downstream systems that use or house claims data. The CMS 5010 has been responsible for determining the scope of the impact on those systems; what changes are necessary to those systems to successfully implement these changes; the time and resources needed to accomplish the task; and planning and overseeing that those changes were implemented. For the last several years, the CMS 5010 Conversion Initiative has been working with all affected CMS systems to implement all changes necessary for the implementation of Version 5010 codes in preparation for the use and implementation of ICD-10 codes at CMS. Most of the work has been completed. The project is scheduled for completion in 2012 (Any loss of funding now would inhibit CMS' ability to fully convert from version 4010 codes to the new 5010 codes. This in turn would delay or prevent the use of ICD-10 codes at CMS).","In FY2011, the CMS 5010 Conversion Initiative oversaw and coordinated efforts to make the necessary changes and enhancements to the CMS' Medicare systems to replace existing inbound and outbound HIPAA transaction formats with new HIPAA standards formats and data elements, conforming to updated standards versions NCPDP D.0 and ASC X12N 5010. Data repositories with historical data that were converted from 4010 to 5010 include: CWF (CORE FFS), HCIS, IDR, NCH, NDB, NMUD, OCSQ, ORDI and ZPIC. Major 5010 changes for Core and Downstream Systems included: Addition of Indicator Code to differentiate between ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes; Expanded fields for Diagnosis and Procedure Code positions in preparation for ICD-10; Increased the number of occurrences of Diagnosis and Procedure Codes; Increased number of POA indicators; Increased size of several amount fields; Additions of new fields to claims format; and Increased size of Prescription Service Reference Number field for NCPDP D.0.",FY 2012 activities will focus on continued monitoring and testing as well as conducting fixes as needed. Each application will continue to perform its required security control assessments on a yearly basis in order to obtain and/or maintain their Authority to Operate (ATO).

BHCMIS also supports the HHS strategic goal to Improve the safety, quality, affordability and accessibility of health care, including behavioral health care and long-term care by providing access to program specific electronic applications and progress report information.  It enhances the quality, availability and delivery of BPHC program specific information and services to citizens, employees, businesses and governments.    BHCMIS currently has over 2,000 stakeholders both internal and external to HRSA: HRSA/BPHC Project Officers, analysts and managers, grants management specialists, grant applicants, Primary Care Associations, Health Center Grantees, FQHC LookAlikes organizations.  Benefits BHCMIS provides to its stakeholders include making reports web accessible, implementing user interfaces that reduce data entry time and reducing costs related to processing audit reports and reviewing applications.BHCMIS development began in 2006 to support BPHC in managing the Health Center Program.  At that time, BHCMIS was included in HRSA's Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) investment.  For BY2013, BHCMIS became a major IT investment, but will continue to be fully integrated with EHBs.  BHCMIS will continue to operate under the same architecture, sharing common system components, single sign on log-in, access controls, data management and workflow.  BHCMIS is dependent upon the EHBs investment in that it must stay in alignment with EHBs operations and enhancements.","BHCMIS supports the performance gap related to increasing the efficiency of HRSA/BPHC staff as well as the efficiency in which grants are processed.  If BHCMIS is not fully funded, BPHC will not be able to support its business functions, including program administration, monitoring, reporting, and analyses.  This is because BHCMIS contains data that is required for completeness and eligibility reviews, objective reviews, selections, and funding determination amounts.  In addition, BHCMIS contains proposed performance measures and objectives against which the progress of a grant is monitored and tracked.  BHCMIS also collects and aggregates program data to ensure compliance with legislative mandates and to report to Congress, OMB and other policy makers on program accomplishments.   BHCMIS supports over 1100 grantees by providing customer-friendly electronic program applications, reporting, and communications.  This significantly improves reporting accuracy, data sharing, and overall program efficiency and saves over $20 million in administrative costs, including printing costs, document reproduction, quality assurance, completeness and accuracy checks, postage file storage and communications. BHCMIS has streamlined and simplified many of BHPC's grants and data reporting processes through enhancements that produce numerous benefits for grantees including: improved processes for applying for grants; facilitating submissions for requesting changes in scope of project; and, more efficient performance reporting.  Grant application processes based upon uploading hard copy paper documents were replaced with a more efficient electronic submission through the EHBs portal and BHCMIS.  With the enhanced EHBs and BHCMIS, grantees and HRSA staff have ready access to reliable information needed for effective decision-making and program implementation.  For HRSA/BPHC, these enhancements bring together in one centralized system, the data and information needed to monitor grants, record program changes, and track program performance; and, assist and simplify communications between grantees, project officers, and the HRSA Office of Grants Management.","FY2011 DME: PG, PCA, HCCN and NCAs application forms; prefunding reviews for SBHC, ES, PG and NAP; SAC and NCC PAR; C&E reviews for SAC, SBHC, NAP, PCA and HCCN's and PG; multiple technical reviews for SBHC, NAP, CD; progressive action workflow changes based on the SOP, PAR, cycle conditions and enhancements; data collection, quality assurance; preliminary, roll up, comparison, web data; clinical measures; custom reports module, support data collection; data collection and closeout reporting and prepare final reports; ACA quarterly report requirements; services verification, ACA flags on SBHCC & CD service site, various scope snapshot reports; U/R functionality, ID interface, transfer/split/ merger functionality, workflow; Audit Outlier Process, reports; support for New, Renewal and Recertification packages, reviews; integration with scope module, UDS reporting, and designation module; related reports;  FY2011 O&M:  Maintenance and continuation of operations.","The BHCMIS DME for FY 2012 includes:  *          EHBs Integration:  Continue to integrate closely with the EHBs platform to leverage all the benefits. *          UI upgrades:  Support UI upgrades across all existing modules based on CCB approved master plan. *          GAAM:  Support additional development for SAC and NCC 2013 Application, C&E, Pre-funding reviews as well as any new application package (2). *          FTCA:  Support for FY 2012 cycle. *          FTCA Free Clinic - develop a structured, electronic free clinic FTCA application package and internal processing workflow. *          PMM:  Expand functionality of PMM.*          Scope - Baseline Scope Verification, Universal Scope module Scope - change in Scope re-evaluation and re-fresh.  *          HCCN:  Develop an annual reporting requirement (PIMS Conversion).*          Dashboard:  PO and National Dashboard Development. *          FTCA:  Particularized Determination receiving and tracking, developing a staggered FTCA process. *          UDS:  2012 UDS data Collection Support, reports and validation support.

These tools will integrate many of the Agency's pilot programs into the National Fraud Prevention Program and complement the work of the joint HHS and Department of Justice Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT).  CMS awarded two contracts by July 2011 to expand Medicare's use of predictive modeling tools. One award was for a risk scoring solution that uses proven predictive models to generate alerts and triangulate the results to identify high-risk claims and providers most likely to be engaged in fraudulent or wasteful behavior, or abusing Medicare policy. In addition, the solution includes an integrated case management system that will track the findings to ensure that appropriate actions are taken timely.  The other award was for developing, testing, and refining predictive models that can be incorporated into the risk scoring solution. Before applying the predictive models to claims prepayment or taking action on providers, the models will be rigorously tested to: 1.      ensure that claims are paid for legitimate providers without disruption or additional costs to honest providers;2.      ensure there is no change in beneficiaries' access to care; and 3.      identify the most efficient analytics to appropriately target resources to the highest risk claims or providers.   CMS plans to develop a national fraud rate beginning with fraud rates for Durable Medical Equipment and Home Health Agencies.  The fraud rate will give CMS a baseline against which to measure the success of all CMS fraud detection/prevention  activities in detecting and preventing fraud.","Before this investment, Medicare fraud detection and prevention activities were decentralized and newly discovered fraud schemes could not be addressed timely.  With this effort, newly discovered fraud schemes can be made instantly available to local Medicare contractors to develop actions to protect against the occurrence of the schemes in their locality.

Under the QIO business lines, CMS maintains contracts with independent community-based organizations to ensure that medical care paid under the Medicare program is reasonable and medically necessary, meets professionally recognized standards of quality, and is provided in the most economical setting. This investment supports data exchange gateways for secure communications and healthcare quality data exchange between QIOs, hospitals, physician offices, nursing homes, ESRD networks and facilities, and data vendors. The contracts under this investment support data center operations, application development, telecommunication fees, helpdesk, project management, ILC artifacts and other IT infrastructure. QPI also provides the application, data, and physical infrastructure to support the QIO business lines with the efficient collection, analysis, dissemination, & management of data guiding policy & intervention, as well as QIO program evaluation. The portion of this investment originally known as QNET, operational in May 1997, interfaces with CMS CO/ROs, QIES, ESRD networks, 53 QIOs, and CDAC systems. QNET greatly expanded to directly include support of goals in PMA Initiative Expanded E-Government & the HHS strategic plan of Improving Health Care Quality, Safety, Cost and Value. The IT investments under this portfolio will also include the IT work as described above for ACA provisions 3001, 3002, 3004, 3005, and 10332, as these are now OMB approved QIO business lines. Future accomplishments will be to ensure the 10 SOW systems are up and Hospital Reporting System is expanding its data collection for agency quality initiatives under ACA. In addition, CMS is aligning the CMS Physician Quality Incentive Program Investment with ACA section 3002 and the hospital reporting system with ACA section 3001. The Physician Quality Incentive Program has developed and implemented quality measure reporting programs for multiple settings of care and will continue to do so. This program promotes higher quality, more efficient health care for Medicare beneficiaries. The reporting of quality measures encourages physicians to improve their quality of care and empowers consumers with information to make more educated health care decisions.","In the HHS strategic plan, objective 1.3 states: To improve health care quality, safety, cost, and value. This investment addresses all of these goals. The purpose of QualityNet Exchange is to improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries through increased efficiencies in information exchange.

RASS currently consists of the Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS), the Risk Adjustment System (RAS), and the RAS Analysis and Reporting Tool (RAS ART). RASS is in the process of converting ICD-9 Diagnosis Code based risk score calculations to those based on the ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes over a phased implementation of October 2013. The RAPS application performs daily edit/update functions on Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) beneficiary diagnosis data input files received through the Front End Risk Adjustment System (FERAS). These diagnoses are used by the RAS application for the Risk Adjustment model run process. RAS receives Fee-for-Service (FFS) diagnostic information from the National Medicare Utilization Database (NMUD) and MA diagnostic information from RAPS and beneficiary data; calculates Risk Adjustment Factors (RAFs); and feeds the RAFs to MARx for computing Prospective Payments. RAS ART is an online application that: allows data access by CMS Business Owners to measure the performance of the MAOs; identifies data quality issues; establishes benchmark data for Plan comparison; and analyzes the RAS RAFs for the plans based on the model runs. Funds will also be utilized to transition the RASS Testing Services to the MAPD Testing Services contractor per the ESD Services Model in 2012. The investment secures the resources needed to operate and maintain these systems within FISMA compliance and within CMS requirements.
