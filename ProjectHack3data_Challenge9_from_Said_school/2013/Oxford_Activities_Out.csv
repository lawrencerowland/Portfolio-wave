2163,286294: Imports 2 FY12H1,"This represents preliminary high-level schedule activity and cost estimates.  As further details are developed, the following scope will be broken out into detailed activities, dates, and cost estimates. This is the first six months of Imports 2 and includes the following. Imports 2 will contain work for Entry Manager (EM), Import Trade Auxiliary Communications System (ITACS), Predictive Rick-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT), Prior Notice Manager (PNM), and Customs System Interface (CSI). For EM, this will focus on migrating functionality from the legacy systems Operational and Administrate System for Import Support (OASIS) and Entry Review to support 801(a) screening. For ITACS, this will focus on account management (via Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS)) and additional functionality enabled by logins. For PREDICT, this will focus on building functionality to better manage rules. For PNM and CSI, this will focus on requirements. EM will provide functionality for screening, in conjunction with PREDICT, for the majority of the 20,000,000+ products imported via the 801(a) process annually. This will give import screeners and import compliance officers a unified interface for dealing with all of their work flows, including tracking Field Work (accomplished in Field Work Manager (FWM)). PREDICT is an expert system built around a rules engine that produces a risk-based score of imported products. Products with a low score are automatically sent forward by PREDICT. Products with a higher score require an import screener to review the product by using EM. ITACS is used to interface with import filers and industry to provide a conduit for supporting documentation. This will reduce the current use of phone calls and emails, provide FDA with a more reliable information source and record, and give industry a more efficient way of communicating. Use of this component by industry is voluntary, so it must provide an incentive for external partners. PNM will provide the interface for work flows associated with 801(m) import screening, Prior Notice, which is focused on Food Security and Food Safety. This will replace functionality currently in OASIS. CSI will replace the outdated technology currently used for the interface between FDA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Work on CSI is dependent upon and must be done in conjunction with CBP so as to accommodate CBP modifications and enhancements.

2167,286298: Software Acquisition for Oracle Technologies Parent Activity,"This is a software acquisition of COTS technologies. This includes an expansion of the licenses for the BPMS (Business Process Management Suite) (including Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)), Oracle Identity Management (IDM) Suite, WebCenter, Oracle Policy Automation (OPA), and Real User Experience Insight (RUEI). The license expansion for the BPMS includes enough licenses for all FDA users. A number of FDA Centers have expressed interest in using this platform for their systems. MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences. OPA is a rules engine that will have a number of applications in MARCS ranging from inspection preparation, intelligent questionnaires, and import screening support. RUEI is a tool that can be used from a centralized location to determine the experience that an end user at a remote site is having. ORA is a geographically dispersed organization. In this sense, the user community for MARCS is different from Center user communities since the vast majority of users are not in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This tool will give ORA and OIM a new ability to understand what is actually happening at user sites and will enable a systematic approach towards improving performance and reliability in the Field.

2700,Expanded Industrial Base (EIB),"The LMP Expanded Industrial Base (EIB) effort encompasses the development of Shop Floor Automation (SFA) capabilities and additional components to Army Materiel Command Industrial Base Operations.  Once designed, developed, tested and deployed, the LMP EIB solution will interface with the Enterprise Equipment Master (EEM) record in Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A). The solution will be AIT enabled and support more efficient inventory asset tracking. One of the primary objectives of the LMP EIB is to comply with AIT requirements based on transactional volume and efficiency impact. Therefore, AIT functional requirements will be integrated into the LMP roadmap in conjunction with Shop Floor Automation (SFA), Item Unique Identification (IUID), and the LMP Equipment Master (LEM). SFA capabilities will drive effective execution of manufacturing operations by guiding, triggering, and reporting plant activities as events occur from point-of-order release into manufacturing to point-of-product delivery to finished goods. Within the LMP suite, SFA will provide mission-critical information about production activities across the enterprise and supply chain. The collection, tracking, documenting, archiving, and analysis of the detailed shop floor data generated by the manufacturing activities will be performed in the SAP Complex Assembly Manufacturing System (CAMS) module. The required data will be exchanged between the SAP CAMS and SAP ECC. SFA will bridge the gap between the current ERP capabilities in LMP and the capabilities required on the shop floor. The power of full ERP integration, supplemented by the AIT, IUID, LEM, and shop floor automation technology, will provide a world-class solution to the management and maintenance of the Army''s modernized arsenals, depots, and ammo plants. Initially, as a sub-component of the SFA requirements, the EIB solution will include tool crib management. This element of Plant Maintenance (PM) is considered to be a critical segment of the consolidation with SFA, AIT, LEM and IUID during near term implementation. During this next reporting period, the EIB solution will be analyzed and designed and later developed, tested, and deployed to the Army Materiel Command Industrial Base Operations in concert with the Business Capability Lifecycle (BCL) model.",Key Deliverable,2012-01-27,2012-12-31,32.67,32.67,In-progress,1,07/26/2012,11375,339 days,,138 days

Enhance the matching and selecting criteria via the RBIS' Firms Master utility module to facilitate the gray area resolution  processes, as well as integrate  with  Firms Management  System (FMS) to ensure updates  resulting from the gray area resolution are propagated both upstream and downstream through automated and manual merges.  Integrate additional sources of data or provide information to FDA that will facilitate the resolution of Firms data that cannot be unequivocally determined by RBIS.",Usable Functionality,2011-09-12,2012-03-11,0.064,0.108,In-progress,1,07/23/2012,12569,181 days,,0 days
2044,287722: RBIS DQ FY12H1,"This is the first six months of this activity and includes the following. This focuses primarily on Firm Master List Services (FMLS). This includes additional Center integration, gray area resolution, additional support for Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB) integration, and improved integration with  Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services (MARCS) Predictive Risk-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) for validating firm information. FDA receives much firm information via Center systems, including FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS) and eLIST (no acronym). This will focus on improving and automating more of this information transfer. Gray area resolution is used to resolve uncertainties regarding firm information when the survivorship rules used in FMLS do not produce a clear resolution. Survivorship rules are implemented via the COTS Dataflux and are an automated way to correct firm data, merge, unmerge, and delete Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEI). Manual gray area resolution is performed to tweak survivorship rules and manually resolve information discrepancies. DnB integration will be expanded, including a review of the current firm inventory in ORA and matching these against DnB information to produce a confidence level from 1 to 10 (10 is highest confidence) to support estimating the risk associated with a firm based on the quality of firm information. This will be used to support risk based decisions such as used for import screening. The method used to validate firm information from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that is then used by PREDICT in import screening will be modified to improve this, reduce latency, reduce uncertainty, and reduce reprocessing. FMLS in RBIS is closely aligned with Firm Management Services (FMS) in MARCS. FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information. As FMS is modified, FMLS will also be modified to support expanded functionality for MARCS users.  During the first six months, the primary focus will be on requirements and design.",Usable Functionality,2011-11-01,2012-03-11,0.039,0.084,Completed - Closed,1,07/23/2012,12572,131 days,28 days,92 days
