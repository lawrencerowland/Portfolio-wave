The tool suite was deployed for its first operational use on the EFT-1 mission in 2014, and was certified for ISS operations in November, 2015; it will be extended for use on Exploration and Commercial Crew missions in the near future.  
The FreeFlyer software system objectives/Outcomes:
   *Reduce the time required to train and certify flight dynamics personnel, by providing commonality between the software used to support multiple Programs (ISS, Orion, SLS, Commercial Crew) and disciplines (TOPO, FDO, VVO, Pointing, etc.).
   *Reduce the cost required for maintenance and sustaining of the software, through a significant reduction in lines of code (FDS/FreeFlyer ~1500 KSLOC, Heritage Shuttle/ISS tools SLOC ~2600 KSLOC).
   *Increases usability and flexibility over heritage tools by allowing analysts and flight controllers to quickly perform analysis tasks without making modifications to the software code base.
   *Leverages the Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) product from a.i. solutions called FreeFlyer as the core astrodynamics engine. Code base changes in the FreeFlyer core are shared not only with JSC but also with other customers such as the Flight Dynamics Facility at GSFC and the Air Force GPS Control Center, meaning all users benefit from upgrades no matter who initiates them. 
   *Is developed as a Class C safety-critical software project to meet the stringent NASA requirements for human spaceflight operations support.

The platform is a virtual cloud based solution with flexible, interoperable micro services for use by multiple CDC programs as shared services. 
The platform will develop a core set of services responsive to allow for existing surveillance systems to use the platform and migrate its data collection activities. The investment includes the IT services and software developed in the following activity components.
 
Shared services and infrastructure to provide core public health software functions
External partner technical assistance to enable state and local public health jurisdictions to adapt their disparate systems to redirect data streams to the platform
IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity enhancements to support cloud computing
Integration to engage internal and external stakeholder representation

HETS is an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) application that enables Medicare providers, suppliers and their authorized representatives to request Medicare beneficiary eligibility data and receive a response in real-time mode for the purposes of preparing an accurate Medicare claim, determining beneficiary liability, or determining beneficiary eligibility for specific services.

The HETS 270/271 application is built based on the core requirements of an ASC Xl2 270/271 EDI HIPAA-compliant eligibility inquiry system. HETS provides a real-time methodology to accept eligibility inquiries (known as 270 transactions) and provide appropriate and timely responses (known as 271 transactions) to authorized submitters.

The purpose of the HETS 270/271 Eligibility Inquiry Transaction system is to allow Medicare providers and their authorized representatives to submit eligibility requests and receive responses via HIPAA-compliant Xl2N 270/271 transactions. Authorized representatives include Trading Partners such as clearinghouses and third party vendors, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), and the Veteran's Administration (VA). The information in the HETS 271 responses includes data on Part A and Part B eligibility, deductibles, coinsurance, preventive services, and benefit utilization; Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D (Drug Plan) enrollment.

HETS currently completes 5 million 270 – 271 provider health service eligibility requests transactions daily.  In order to provide timely responses the system objectives related to eligibility transactions, allow for growth and ensure the system will are:

To complete over 90% of in 5 seconds or less.

To have less than 1% of timeouts.

To have less than 1% of system errors.

The original goal of MAS was to utilize MAS throughout the five levels of the Medicare appeals process. This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process.
 
The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed. 
 
Given the MAS' capabilities for cross-level case tracking, interfacing with the shared systems, and electronic imaging, we believe that expanding use of the MAS to encompass first level appeals has the potential to create significant efficiencies in the claim appeals process. Thus, CMS is exploring options to implement the MAS at all Durable Medical Equipment MACs (DME MACs) and Part A and Part B MACs (A/B MACs).",2011-09-16,2012-09-15,0.42,"2 - Iterative: Incremental, Spiral, Agile",yes,,,,,,,0,0,Green,0.007,2.14,Green,Completed,09/11/2014,13:31:05

This will enable enhanced integration between eLEXNET and MARCS and set up ORA to work better with external partners such as FERN and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). A pilot for supporting mobile applications in FERN participating labs will also be conducted. Mobile applications could potentially in the future support a range of hardware that is not FDA specified as these are external partners.

MARCS is divided into a set of components. There are application and service components. The work flows in ORA will often cross multiple organizations and include a number of different user activity types such as screening, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, and compliance. The application components are designed to provide user groups with a one stop shop interface that will allow them to perform work from their user point of view. Functionality is only implemented once in a component. One user group work flow may use functionality from most of the MARCS components. This has implications for the management of MARCS. While the individual projects build out certain types of functionality, these need to be combined and coordinated into a whole in order to provide a useful work flow that covers the whole life cycle of a regulated product as it passes from one user group to the next. This combination and coordination needs to occur at the program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. PMTI includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI begins work on a release when it is time to start system integration testing. Work for a release includes system integration testing, promotion to the pre-production environment, performance testing, user acceptance testing, promotion to the production environment, security testing, and then release. Program management in this project includes release management and management of dependencies. This also includes system architecture, a road map, inter project coordination, decision analysis (for technology and platform selection), security work, user experience management (user friendly and consistent interface), inter project requirements management, status meetings, reports, risk management, and configuration management.

For such user communities, ORADSS has a number of Data Marts (DM) that certain designated users can use for querying. These are also used to support universes for reporting. ORADSS uses a COTS, Business Objects (BO), as a reporting tool. BO utilizes universes as a meta-data layer that allows for an abstraction of the underlying schema, table names, row names, and data types so that non technical users can access this data more easily. The universe structures may then be used to build reports.

FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information. This includes receiving firm information from registration and listing from the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS). FURLS is being partially replaced by eLIST. FMLS will integrate with eLIST (no acronym). The firm data is built around Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). These define a location and a product or a set of products. A large company may have multiple FEIs if it has multiple physical locations and/or produces different products that are regulated by FDA. This information is always changing as firms and market conditions change.  In addition, foreign firms that do not use a Latin alphabet present a particular problem as words can be transliterated into English in different ways. If this is left unchecked, it causes a proliferation of FEIs that are not all that useful in identifying what firm is what. To address this, FMLS employs Dataflux, a COTS, in implementing survivorship rules that are used to clean up this firm data and consolidate and remove FEIs. FMLS is also being integrated with Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB). DnB has one of the largest and most reliable databases on businesses in the world.

RBIS will integrate data from other FRDA Business Centers and ORA repositories, to present a single view of data across FDA. RBIS will provide a single source of data for ORA’s inspection locations (establishments) and provide services associated with these inspection locations. 

RBIS will enable centers to obtain establishment and ORA field operations data in order to implement workforce planning, establish food safety policies, and enforce compliance programs on regulated products. RBIS identifies and removes duplicate firms from ORA's inspection location inventory. RBIS provides web services to validate addresses and match firms within the establishment inventory.

RBIS will provide a search capability to view structured and unstructured data including: Field Accomplishment Computerized Tracking System (FACTS) inspection data, establishment inspection Reports, FDA 483 Observations report, firm details and history data, and recall information. RBIS includes a critical 24/7 application supporting field entry reviewers in the admissibility decisions of import operations. RBIS will provide over 25 Business Intelligence Universes for ad-hoc reporting, over 1,000 pre-defined reports and over 70,000 user-defined reports supporting a wide variety of functions across FDA.

RBIS will be used by ORA Investigators, Inspectors, Import Screeners, Supervisors, Branch Directors, District Directors, Technicians, Coordinators, State Contract Monitors, Compliance Officers, and Planners, Program Managers, Firm Data Stewards, and Risk-based Input users.

DCPS will transition the DD components from 52 fragmented, highly customized legacy systems to a common system that uses automated tools and leverages current technology.  DCPS will benefit SSA's disability process functionally and technologically by providing full process integration, ease of sharing disability processing workload across DD Component sites, a common interface with other SSA offices and systems, and a dramatic reduction in the technological complexity of system support. Once fully operational, DCPS will deliver common functionality and consistent support to each DD Component, while providing accurate, current, consistent, and accessible data for national consumption; leading to enhanced anti-fraud efforts, as well as enhancing the agency’s IT security posture through greater visibility and accountability.  DCPS will integrate the entire claims process from start to finish, including case processing, correspondence, fiscal, management information, and workload management.  The system will use electronic case analysis to support disability examiners in making consistent decisions based on SSA Disability Policy, and leverage SSA's investment in Intelligent Disability.    It will provide a disability vendor repository that consolidates existing DD Component vendor data stores, which can then be utilized by all the disability case processing partners nationwide (e.g., Field Offices, DDSs, and Hearing Offices).  DCPS will provide SSA Disability Policy consistency, compliance, and flexibility as we are able to implement policy changes more readily to keep pace with changes in the environment.  Replacing the current DD component systems with DCPS will minimize the average processing time for initial disability claims, decrease case processing-related task time and provide increased system availability to improve the overall quality of the disability determination process.

The current SABRS is built on dated technology that will reach the end of its supportable life in July 2019.

The end of supportable life issue for the current application would introduce potential security vulnerabilities.

Consequently, Retail has obtained approval from the Investment Review Board (IRB) to initiate a project to develop and deploy a more technologically current and viable replacement for SABRS.  The IRB gave initial approval to explore the concept of building a replacement on 09-11-2017.  The FS Technical Architectural Review Board (TARB) approved the proposed design on 04-02-2018, and the IRB authorized the project to proceed on 05-07-2018.

Replacing the current technologically dated application is expect to yield savings in operations and maintenance cost.

The second data center is currently planned to be DHS Data Center 2 (DC2). The capability associated with achieving this milestone is focused on replicating mission-critical TECS user interface functionality, making it possible to have switchover capability during TECS system maintenance and for unscheduled outages. Achieving this capability also establishes a disaster recovery (DR) site as well as a Continuity of Operations (COOP) capability that greatly enhances current capability. 
 
Being able to switch operations between data centers establishes the ability to continue using mission critical functions without the limitations experienced with legacy TECS during planned maintenance or unplanned outages. This closes a longstanding capability gap. The lessons learned and results from DC2 Milestone will allow CBP to fully assess emerging cloud technology, and determine if the replication of less critical functions should be established at DC2 or onto the cloud technology, which may reduce or replace reliance on brick and mortar data center infrastructures.",2016-10-01,2017-03-30,3.781,"3 - Not Primarily a Software Development Project",n/a,"This is a Data Center Migration project, not a software development project.

Stability is required for both currently participating States and Territories, as well as new States that join, bringing new types of data. To the greatest extent possible, the system should easily and automatically collect and normalize disparate data resulting in standardized quality data - despite the introduction of new data sources. The following objectives will be met by TMSIS:
1. Maximize the level of automation to produce stable and consistent data quality.

QIOs work under contract on strategic initiatives and projects that seek to achieve CMS’s aims of better health care, better health and lower healthcare costs through improvement for all Medicare beneficiaries.

The MCR pilot will provide a payment collection solution that can be used on a mobile device, a tablet, or a standard desktop computer, accept electronic payment methods, and, through a direct interface to CBP’s back end systems, remove the need for manual data entry after the payment is collected. Furthermore, the MCR pilot will incorporate features that decrease the time it takes for CBP Officers (CBPOs) in the field require to collect a payment and issue a receipt, in order to lay the foundation for an Alternative Analysis evaluating the approach for the migration, consolidation, reporting and analysis of all CBP revenue collections.
The major objectives for/of the MCR Pilot are listed as follows: 
- Streamline collection process by reducing time spent preparing a manual 368 receipt and Form 1002, allowing officers to focus on mission essential functions.
-  Eliminate all manual supporting processes associated with the paper 368 and 1002, including manual transcription of data into CBP systems, maintaining paper documentation, maintaining security, conducting audits, and issuance of 368 books.
- Codify, publish, and maintain business rules for collections outside the cash register environment among all ports (e.g., fee changes, separation of collections that cannot be on the same receipt).
- Remove void processes associated with handwriting mistakes in the amount section of the 368 form.

The Global Entry Online Enrollment System (GOES) is an Internet web application which enables the public to apply for Trusted Traveler Programs.  GOES facilitates the payment of a non-refundable application fee by credit card or ACH debit. Between the different programs GOES processes several thousand payments on an average day.
The Decal/Transponder Online Payment System (DTOPS) allows users to purchase, renew, transfer, and exchange user fee decals and transponders for their conveyance.
While serving quite different purposes/programs GOES and DTOPS are very similar from a “collections perspective”: The web application (GOES/DTOPS) sends activities to Pay.gov, and, once successfully processed, to CBP’s revenue system, ACS. Payments are being settled by Pay.gov and its banking partners (such as VANTIV for credit card payments), which in turn deposit the funds into CBP’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank. ACS receives the collections information from Pay.gov and clears receivables established based on the applications GOES and DTOPS send to ACS. In case of failed payments (e.g., credit card chargebacks) ACS will send notification to GOES/DTOPS and the corresponding application will be denied. In this case the Revenue group in Indianapolis will bill the traveler.

In December of 2015 Office of Finance (OF) Financial Systems Division (FSD) (Revenue, NFC, AAMD, FME, OIT and ACE) reviewed 19 Indianapolis Local Area Network (Indy LAN) systems which are mostly part of CBP’s Bill-to-Collect process area.  These systems are databases which are housed within the Indianapolis LAN. The Indy LAN systems need to be removed and / or replaced onto approved CBP systems, in order to mitigate ongoing security and standardization concerns.
Of the 19 systems, a high-level proof of concept was evaluated for four (4) of the systems to test a migration to SAP during this pilot project. 
The four systems included in this proof of concept are:
1. Bankruptcy: 
The Bankruptcy LAN Database tracks dates and pertinent data for complying with the Bankruptcy Court claims filing deadlines. Each stage of the bankruptcy case is tracked and the database allows CBP to monitor its recovery rates based on claims filed.  
2. Promissory Notes
The Promissory Notes LAN Database was developed to record and track all executed Promissory Notes entered into where the principal totals more than $2,000. The database calculates the repayment schedule/amortization schedule for the promissory note using the appropriate interest rates and tracks the timeliness of the promissory note payments.
3. Harbor Maintenance Fees (HMF)

The budget includes the costs for the development, testing, deployment, operations and maintenance, change management and communications for the myData system. It also covers the ServiceNow licenses for the department, specifically 10,000 Service Management Suite with Platform Runtime licenses for internal use, as well as 110,000 legacy request module licenses.

Expected outcomes include a cloud-based, more robust solution that centralizes and standardizes the data collection needs of approximately 171 offices expending fewer man hours using ServiceNow as a platform. This solution addressed an increasing number of security violations over the last few years in the legacy eForms system. myData enables the department to improve its compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) by reducing the need for Department personnel to pursue inefficient stop/gap measures to satisfy evolving needs not met by the existing eForms solution and mitigated the security risks with a more secure system. By developing a common platform that leverages an enterprise licensing model, the Department reduces the cost of disparate licenses and eliminate redundant development efforts. Centralization also reduces duplicate data entry by bureaus within the Department and increases visibility to enable greater data-driven insights. Another benefit is enhanced unified system security through management of a single certified system that meets guidelines and regulations for sensitive and personal information collected on the unclassified system.",2016-10-03,2022-09-30,46.71445,"2 - Iterative: Incremental, Spiral, Agile",yes,,2018-08-24,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,Green,5.136324,11,Yellow,In-progress,10/31/2018,14:46:16

In addition, VA may also bill and collect co-pays from a number of Veterans who receive non-service-connected care or prescriptions from VA medical facilities.  VHA  established Chief Business Office (CBO) in 2002 to the processes to bill and collect, provide corporate oversight, and further professionalize healthcare revenue activities.  Since 2003, CBO's  POWER reporting system (POWER/POWER PLUS) has supported VHA's efforts to improve performance in its revenue collections business operations by providing accurate, reliable, and up-to-date outcome and performance measure information.  The performance information in POWER/POWER Plus has allowed VHA management to create reports to manage, analyze, and monitor metrics for revenue tracking, yielding over $3 billion per year.  The performance of this system and its reporting capabilities are critical to maximizing revenue collections.  Inconsistency or variation of data will negatively impact revenue collections, which would result in a reduction of funding provided to VA medical centers and ultimately negatively impact the Veterans with regard to obtaining healthcare service.  Therefor it is critical to maintain technical expertise and continuity of services to reduce variation in reporting and minimize the risk for inconsistent and/or inaccurate data analyzed by high echelon Government personnel and utilized in budgetary planning and decision-making as well as revenue collection.Over the years, dependency on the POWER/POWER Plus reports has grown.
