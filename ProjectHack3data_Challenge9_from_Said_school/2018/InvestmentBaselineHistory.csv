Within the first 6 months, we will have completed 66% of the goal and completed the entire 99% by the end of the FY. The reason for changing this measure to an annual goal is since when having this as a biannual goal, we would have two separate measures (i.e. 66% and 33% or 99% total), and that option is not permitted in the eCPIC system, changing this to an annual goal will satisfy this requirement by just having the one goal of 99%.

Make the ACS Staff Stats performance metric an annual metric with the goal of 85%. We would like to change this metric to an annual metric as the program makes incremental steps toward the end-of-year goal, and having this as a biannual metric would require that each period would have a separate numeric goal which is not permitted in the eCPIC system; therefore we will change this metric to an annual goal with the single end-of- year target of 85%.

1) Rebaseline - change in scope:  Project ID 4007D11004.  Eliminated term, ""Phase II"" in Project Name and Project Description.  Steps II covers this phase and this delection eliminates any confusion with Activity phases.  Increased cost.  Steps II increased scope of work.

3) Rebaseline - change in scope:  Project ID 4007M11002. Cost decreased from $1625 to $927.554.  The decrease is because COGS is concentrating on production processing changes and reduced scope and adjusted change implementation schedule.

This will allow for the standardization of the CBS operating system and hardware platform.  

In 2005, the CBS Executive Board conducted a business case and initiated a CBS consolidation effort to standardize the CBS technology platform, including efforts to co-locate the CBS and its associated environments at a single location, the Census Data Center (CDC) in 2008.  However, this project was redirected as a result of changes in the Census Bureau s priorities due to unforeseen issues with the Decennial Census.  Several decennial systems were moved to the CDC resulting in a power supply issue that forced the CBS servers to move out of the CDC.

DCPDS relies on digital signatures that are electronically signed and validated using SHA. By using a private ""key"" that is paired with a public key, both generated using SHA, a file can be electronically signed and the signature verified by a recipient. SHA is also used to provide assurance that a file has not been altered during transmission. The current standard for that utility is known as SHA-1. DoD has mandated that all DoD systems use a new version of SHA-256 no later than December 2013. DCPDS software and hardware will be upgraded and integrated to meet the minimum SHA-256 requirement to maintain DCPDS compliancy with all DoD security regulations and directives.""",,,1994-2020,,,2013-12-10,14:29:01,15907

1.    Replan of existing FPLS Projects:
 
The ""Move NDNH to Relational Database"" and ""e-Employer Search"" projects, which are part of the FPLS FY2012 Project Baseline, each have activities that carry over into FY2013.  When the FY2012 baseline was developed, a placeholder schedule for these milestones was input, since the official project schedule had not yet been approved.  Based on the most recent stage gate review for each of these projects, the FPLS Strategic Planning and Oversight Board (SPOB) has approved minor changes in cost and schedule for the following FY2013 activities: #291864, #291755, #291756.  These changes represent a less than 10% change from the original baseline, and constitute a replan.
 
2.    Updating FY2012 Project Descriptions:
 
A number of existing FY2012 project descriptions have been updated to include project objectives and outcomes, per current OMB guidance.  In addition, language related to FY2012 project stages at the beginning of FY2012 has been removed or updated.
 
3.    Adding FY2013 and FY2014 Projects to the FPLS Baseline
-         Annual update to add planned future projects.
 
4.    Adding FY2013 targets to existing FPLS Performance Metrics
-         Annual update to current year targets.
 
5.    Changing the reporting frequencies from semi-annual to annual for the following existing FPLS Performance Metrics, and adding alignment with HHS Goals and Objectives:
 
In FY2012, five of the FPLS' Performance Metrics were reported on semi-annually.  However, the semi-annual frequency is not appropriate to most of the FPLS metrics.  The annual data is more meaningful because of variations seen throughout the year, so these metrics are being changed based on the new OMB guidance.  Four of the metrics will be changed backed to annual for the FY2014 E300 submission, including: FPLS Benefit-to-Cost-Ratio, Total FPLS Attributable Collections, Percent Increase in Number of IWOs Sent Electronically, and Number of States with Access to the State Services Portal.
 
6.    Deactivating an FY2012 Performance Metric for FY2013 and beyond:
 
In FY2012, one of the FPLS Performance Targets was to increase locate and enforcement actions returned to State Child Support Enforcement Agencies by the FPLS.  This has been an ongoing performance metric for a number of years, achieved through enhancements to the FPLS locate functionality, and the identification of new sources of locate information.  At this time, increasing locate sources and data is no longer an FPLS management priority, and the number of locate and enforcement actions remains constant, or varies based on the NCP population demographics.  Therefore, this metric is being removed from the FPLS performance baseline for FY2013 and beyond.
 
7.    Adding FPLS investment start and end dates:
-         The FPLS does not have a planned end date; however, this field will be populated with a future date to comply with current OMB requirements.",,,1996-2020,,,2012-09-12,16:06:22,9347

Each year, FPLS Management undergoes a detailed review of Continuous Service Improvement (CSI) initiatives currently in progress, along with ideas for additional enhancements to the FPLS, and conducts an Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) to plan and prioritize projects for the upcoming year.  The changes to the FPLS baseline reflect the results of this review and IBR for FY2014 and beyond.  Changes to the current baseline include:
 
1)    A rebaseline of the FY13-14 Debtor File Migration to Relational Database.  This project required a more complex design than originally anticipated, resulting in schedule delays during the design phase.  The change in projected cost is less than one percent, but the revised end date is 2 months later than originally planned.
2)    A replan and increase in detail to the FY14 Improve NDNH Data Quality project (which is now referred to as FY14 Develop Employer Portal project).  This project was initially entered as a planning project for FY2014.  The scope and project plan have now been more clearly defined.  The cost and schedule for this project have both been reduced by less than 10%.
3)    A postponement of the FY14 Migration to Target Architecture and FY14 Improve Medical Support Data Exchange to later start dates.  These projects were also FY2014 planning projects and remain a part of the overall FPLS CSI plan.  However, external dependencies and internal prioritization decisions have postponed the start dates for both projects to the second half of the year.  Total costs for these projects have increased by 2% to reflect increased labor rates in the development contract.  (The Migration to Target Architecture project will now start in FY15, and its title in PMT has been changed to reflect this).
4)    Removal of the FY14 Improve Interstate Case Coordination Tools from the baseline.  The planned budget for this project has been divided up into smaller projects, which will be reflected individually in the new baseline.
5)    Addition of 10 new planning projects for FY2014-FY2015 to the FPLS baseline.  These projects were identified during the annual CSI planning and IBR process, and high-level cost and schedule estimates have been approved by FPLS Management.  Detailed project plans and schedules will be presented for approval at the project selection stage gate review prior to each project's individual start date.
 
This baseline change request also includes updates to the FPLS Operational Performance Measures to provide performance targets for FY2014.  There are currently 9 performance metrics in the FPLS baseline.  The following changes to the baselines have been made:
 
-         Metric #283083: Target for FY2014 has been reduced to a 2.4% increase in annual FPLS-attributable collections (decreased from a 2.7% increase in FY2013).  This target was updated to reflect the current 15-year average inflation rate.
-         Metric #283307: Target for the percent increase in number of IWOs sent electronically was increased from 10% in FY13 to 20% in FY14.  The FPLS will significantly exceed the FY13 goal; however, some leveling off is expected in the upcoming years, so we feel the new target is realistic and attainable.
-         Metric #283308: No target is reported for FY2014.  A total of 50 states and territories now use SSP, significantly exceeding the FY2013 goal of 35.  This metric will be removed from the FPLS performance baseline after FY2013 actuals are reported.
-         The remaining six performance targets for FY2014 are identical to the FY2013 targets.  The FPLS is on track to meet these goals, and they remain appropriate measures for the upcoming fiscal year.",,,1996-2020,,,2013-09-11,06:13:03,14323

The estimated end date for milestone #328996 has also been changed to reflect the dates approved by the FPLS PMO.

This project has also completed the Project Baseline Stage Gate. 
3. The FY14 Develop Employer Portal (#318118) has been extended by 73 days. The analysis and Requirements phase (#318120) has been extended by 63 days, and all the other phases have been delayed to accommodate this extension. During the initial analysis and planning process, our stakeholders and external partners identified additional requirements.  Additional time was added to the Analysis and Requirements phase and overall project schedule to allow the FPLS PMO to examine and make the appropriate decision on the additional requirements. 
4. The FY14 TINS/ITINS Analysis and Implementation (#329064) project start date has been delayed by approximately 73 days due to resource overlaps with other ongoing FPLS projects. All milestones have been postponed by approximately two months, at no change to costs. This project remains in the planning stages, detailed project plans and schedules have not yet been developed.

- Metric #283307: Target for the percent increase in number of IWOs sent electronically (e-IWOs) was increased from 10% in FY15 to 20% in FY16. Legislation was passed which requires all states to use eIWOs, so we feel the new increased target is realistic and appropriate.
- Metric #351100: A new annual metric was added that measures the number of states on the OCSE proxy server. 
- Metric #283305: Reporting frequency was changed to monthly to comply with new requirements for a monthly strategic and business results metric.

Each year, FPLS Management conducts a detailed review of Continuous Service Improvements (CSI) initiatives, uses on-going operational analyses to identify additional enhancements to the FPLS, and conducts and Integrated Baseline Review to plan and prioritize projects for the upcoming year.  The changes to the FPLS baseline reflect the results of this process for FY15 and beyond and include:
1) A rebaseline of the FY15 Portal Enhancements Project. The milestones in FY15 were entered initially as planning activities and one milestone has been updated with revised estimates based on the project planning activities. Additionally, a planning milestone has been removed from the baseline.  The overall planned cost of this project was reduced by $74,000 to $238,000.
2) A complete rebaseline of the FY16 FPLS Enhancements, FY16 Portal Expansion, and FY16 Security/Infrastructure Enhancements projects. These projects are FY16 planning projects and have been updated with proposed scope, cost and schedule information. 
3) Addition of one new planning project for FY16.  The Portal 2.0 project was identified during the annual CSI planning and Integrated Baseline Review process, and high-level cost and schedule estimates have been approved by FPLS Management.  Detailed project plans and schedules will be presented for selection and approval, and the baseline will be updated at that point as needed.
4) Addition of three new planning projects for FY17:  FY17 FPLS Enhancements, FY17 CS Portal Enhancements, and FY17 Infrastructure Enhancements.  FPLS management is currently developing a Statement of Work for the operations and maintenance and CSI contract that will include these FY17 development projects. The contract will be awarded at the end of FY16. At this time, these projects are placeholders. After the new contract is awarded, these projects will be updated to reflect the schedule approved during the Project Baseline stage gate review through the standard FPLS PMO process.

For these projects, the original baselines were established as planning projects at the beginning of the year; however, at that time, neither had been through the Project Selection and Project Baseline stage gate reviews.  The changes to each of these baselines are detailed below:

1. The FY2016 Security and Infrastructure costs have been reduced by $38,000 (13.1%) and the schedule has been extended 43 days. The cost and schedule milestones have been updated with the costs and schedules approved by the FPLS Project Management Office (PMO).  The milestone  iPortal Two Factor Authentication has been removed.  This milestone was developed to modify the iPortal to implement a two-factor authentication solution; however, we are still waiting for guidance and direction from the department on when and how to implement this requirement. 
2. The FY2016 FPLS Enhancements project costs have increased $48,000 (10.7%) and the schedule has expanded by 74 days. After our initial planning, the more generic placeholder milestones related to the Employer Table were replaced with a specific initiative to expand the Employer Services functionality to allow employers to provide information that will be useful to states.  Additionally, all other milestones have been updated with the costs and schedules approved by the FPLS PMO.
3. The overall cost of the FY2016 Portal Expansion has decreased by $100,000 (35.4%) and the schedule has been extended by 41 days.  After our analysis, we determined not to proceed with the  ""NMSN Portal Application Pilot milestone and it has been removed from the baseline. The ""MSFIDM Portal Application Development  milestone has been delayed to reflect when we anticipate being able to begin this work. 
4. The FY2016 Portal 2.0 has been renamed the FY2016 Portal Technical Refresh.  The overall cost has decreased by $30,000 (6.0%) and the schedule has been delayed by 77 days. This project is composed of improvements to the Enterprise Services Portal including enhancements to the enterprise architecture and consolidating the authentication and security frameworks.

2.  There is one minor change to the second milestone in the FY2016 FPLS Enhancement project.  The start date for the ""Employer Services Update Development and Testing"" milestone had to be pushed back by 35 days in order for DFS Management to have adequate time to collect and evaluate feedback from the stakeholders, before further development and testing can take place.  The overall project schedule, however, remains unchanged.

a) The QUICK Technology Modernization Phase I and Phase II milestones  were originally identified as part of a FY17 planning project during the FY17 budget submission process.  The Phase I milestone has been updated with proposed scope, cost and schedule information, including a $30,000 increase in costs and an extension to the schedule by 73 days.  The Phase II milestone has subsequently been reduced in scope, cost and duration.  This milestone is still considered a planning project, and has not been approved by the DFS PMO as of this BCR.                                    
b)  The MSER Application Re-engineer Phase I and Phase II milestones began on schedule in September and October 2016.  During the initial phases, additional technical requirements were identified that were out of scope under the previous project plan. The IPT determined it would be more cost-effective to rebaseline this project to add in the additional scope, rather than address the additional requirements in a subsequent project.  The proposed rebaseline includes a cost of $35,000 and extends the schedule of Phase II by 14 days. 
c) The approach for the Portal Modernization Project has changed since the initial FY17 baselinewas submitted, and the FY17 milestones for this project have been adjusted accordingly.  There are currently two initiatives underway that will help define the scope and requirements for the later milestones: a business requirements and planning project (categorized as DME planning) and an initiative to develop a portal architecture road map (done under O&M).  The planned duration and depth of the precursor projects is greater than originally anticipated, and the later development milestones are dependent on these two activities.  Therefore, the initial phase of the development project (Logical Data Architecture) is being removed from the baseline, and some of the scope may shift into later phases of this initiative.

a) FY2017 Technology Modernization: This project experienced delays during the contract base period due to dependencies on SSA resources and internal delays in processing background investigations to bring the appropriate resources on board.   The initial SSA coordination activities have been completed, and the 3-month planning project is scheduled to move through the DFS IT Governance process and begin in early April;.  The first phase of the development project will begin as soon as the analysis is complete.  Therefore, Phase I of this project has been delayed to start on 7/10/2017, and Phase II is being removed from this project.  Later phases will be included in the FY2018 (and beyond) project baselines, and the costs and schedules will incorporate best practices and lessons learned from the Phase I project. The FY2017 project costs are being reduced by 10%, and the project duration is being reduced by 30 days (14%).                            
b) FY17 Infrastructure Enhancements project, Portal Modernization milestones: These two milestones are dependent on a DME Planning Project, the Portal Modernization Business Architecture Planning project.  The analysis/planning project's schedule was recently extended to incorporate additional scope and stakeholder feedback.  The next scheduled phase, the technical requirements milestone, is being removed from this work package and postponed to FY2018 due to dependencies on the analysis project.  The 2nd milestone's scope will be reduced to included only solution architecture activities that can be completed independent of the other two phases.  Currently, no baseline change is being proposed to the Solution Architecture milestone, as it's revised scope and costs are still be evaluated by the system team.  There will be additional milestones added in FY2018 to incorporate the scope of work that was removed from the FY2017 projects.  The removal of the technical requirements milestone from the FY2017 project results in a 25% reduction in the overall FY17 Infrastructure Enhancements project cost.
c) Portal Audit Solution: The final phase of this project is being cancelled and removed from the FPLS FY2017 IT projects baseline.  The first two phases were mandated; the final phase was a placeholder milestone designed to incorporate any additional requirements identified during earlier phases.  This project was a joint effort by the Division of Federal Systems and the Office of Audit; Audit has decided not to move forward using DFS resources for the potential enhancements at this time.

1) Two of the milestones in the FY2018 Infrastructure Enhancements work package (Data Center Migration Analysis and Oracle Database Migration Analysis and Development) have been updated as a result of scope and schedule changes made before the project was officially approved by PMO; the approved baseline cost and schedule projections are included in the current baseline.  A third milestone in this work package, ICR to DB2 was updated to reflect a change in scope identified during the design phase.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2) The start dates for three milestones in the FY2018 Technology Modernization work package (related to the Portal Modernization phases) have been delayed due to additional time needed to bring on staff and collect requirements from stakeholders.  The Integration of Profile and Contacts Functionality phase has been selected, but not yet approved to begin, and the later phases have dependencies on the earlier milestones.  There are no major changes to the overall budget for this work package at this time.

3) The start dates for two milestones in the FY2018 Employer Services Enhancements work package (Employer Portal Application Enhancements Phase II and Phase III) have been delayed as a result of dependencies and issues identified during the analysis phase.  The start date is being postponed to give the project team additional time to evaluate implementation alternatives and develop an approach for the later phases (this analysis will be done under O&M).  The final milestone, Re-Engineering/Delivery by Batch has been removed from the scope of the FY2018 work package.

4) DME Planning Costs have been added to the FY2018 baseline to reflect an additional analysis and planning project related to the overall Technology Modernization initiative, as it was determined early in the year that additional planning and analysis activities were required before the development approach could be finalized.",13888,"Projects, Activities",1996-2030,,,2018-01-10,16:11:03,27802

2. The first milestone in the FY2018 Technology Modernization work package has been updated as a result of planned scope and schedule changes made before the project had been officially approved by the OCSE PMO. This milestone will be updated once the project has gone through the governance process. 
3. There are several changes to the FY2018 CS Portal Modernization work package. Three of the milestones related to the Portal Modernization phases have been removed from the baseline; because of resource constraints, these milestones will be delayed until FY2019 and will continue once the QUICK Technology Modernization and Oracle Database Migration projects have concluded.

The changes to each of these baselines reflect the current DFS Management priorities and approvals, and are detailed below: 
1. The FY2018 Technology Modernization project was put into the baseline as a placeholder for the work to convert code from COBOL to Java. DFS conducted a preliminary analysis to determine our approach to do this code conversion, and determined that the before the complete conversion could begin, existing VSAM tables should be converted to DB2 when possible, and the dependencies on non-converted tables needed to be documented. These initiatives will begin in FY2018, and continue into early FY2019. In the meantime, DFS continues analysis work to determine the best approach and timeline for the eventual COBOL to Java conversion, which will begin in FY19. 
2. The last two milestones in the FY18 Portal Modernization work package were placeholders and are being updated to the baselines that were approved by the DFS governance board, which included cost increases in the testing and implementation phase, and a schedule change due to dependencies on other projects. 
3. The Data Center Migration - Implement Selected Alternative milestone from the FY2018 Infrastructure Enhancements project is being removed. DFS conducted an alternatives analysis to move our data center, and we have decided to remain in our current data center as none of the alternate data center solutions evaluated meet the requirements at a reasonable cost. Follow-on work to refresh our existing data center will take place in FY2019. The Oracle Database Migration milestones are being updated to reflect the approved project schedules for this work. We are adding a placeholder milestone for phase II of testing and implementation that will carry over into FY19. 
4. The last two milestones of the FY2018 Employer Services Enhancements project are being removed.

1.  The final milestone (testing and implementation) of the FY2018 Child Support Portal Modernization project's start date was postponed by one week due to a dependency on another project (FY2018 Infrastructure Enhancements). The new schedule was presented to and approved by the OCSE PMO on 10/25/2018. Due to lessons learned and resource availability, the projected finish date for this project is now 19 days sooner, resulting in an overall schedule change of 4% from the original estimates. The overall cost projections increased by about $12,000, or about 1% of the overall project.  
                                             
2. The FY2019 FPLS Enhancements work package's overall schedule and cost is being updated to reflect updated approaches and priorities of the work being done in this area. As the technical approaches and research requirements for these projects were finalized, the cost and schedule projections increased from the original ROM estimates.                                                                                                    

- The initial analysis for the Employer Information Updates milestone led to a scope increase and approach change which resulted in a longer timeline, and additional milestones related to this effort. This additional scope replaced the Voluntary Collections milestone, which has been removed.  This project was approved by the OCSE PMO on 12/20, and has been updated from the original ROM.                                                                  
-  Last, another milestone in this work package (Employer Services - Delivery by Batch) is being delayed by approximately 5 weeks due to both internal resource conflicts and a dependency on SSA data center resources needed to complete the project planning activities.

3. The performance metric #390927 was changed from measuring collections per caseload to collections per child that is served by the program. After monitoring and reviewing this measure, OCSE decided this was a more meaningful and relevant data point, and will be used as a target/measurement going forward.

NSAP Microsoft SharePoint 2010 architecture FIPS 199 high rated platform from which houses multiple module-like applications. The NSAP platform has its own authority to operate (ATO). Changes to the NSAP platform (such as hosting a new system) are handled via change requests (CRs) in lieu of obtaining an additional ATO as is the cased of  independent applications. NSAP will house the following modules (systems): National Select Agent Registry v6.1 (which already resides there), Etiological Agent Import Permit Program v2.0 (deploying September 2013) and eNSAR v1.0. NSAP and it modules will now make up the total investment. All modules will share the same SharePoint database but separate application databases and schemes. NSAP will provide increased security via a shared service Security Access Management System (SAMS) portal, which complies with eAuthentication level II requirements.

This new platform approach will use a common shared service platform and will reduce both development and steady state costs in future fiscal years while at the same time, significantly enhancing the platform's ability to meet programmatic requirements for both the Federal Select Agent and Etiological Agent programs. This platform will also include the new Electronic NSAR system/module (eNSAR). eNSAR will extend the existing functionality of NSAR to enable external entity users to enter data and retrieve reports through an improved process that focuses on the information elements that are most important to Select Agent Program. eNSAR will allow select agent inspectors to access the system remotely. eNSAR will transition the Select Agents Program and the NSAR system from document-centric to more a robust and flexible data-centric process. By doing this, eNSAR will provide significant cost-savings in terms of time and resources by significantly reducing paper handling and data entry support costs currently associated with the Select Agents program. 
The total investment cost for FY13 and each subsequent fiscal year will be reduced because of this new cost effective approach to hosting and operating the new select agent platform.

The change is needed to realize the cost saving of implementation of a development platform (NSAP), transfer 2013 project costs from the EAIPP V2.0 system into this investment and realign IT project activities with the overall investment timelines. Initial costs and planning dates for eNSAR were generated based on future ROM planning and conceptual solution designs. Cascading delays in the deployment of NSAR versions v6.0 and v6.1 associated with new processes for obtaining ATO (received on June 27, 2013), and various Select Agent Program regulatory changes, have significantly delayed the progress for eNSAR.  Contractor resources initially intended for eNSAR system delivery were retained on activities associated with NSAR 6.1 projects and O&M support. Additionally, resources intended for the eNSAR v1.0 and v2.0 projects were redeployed to the deployment of new OMB mandated Select Agents forms and their associated changes. These changes or their associated complications were not known when the eNSAR projects were originally entered into Prosight. Although eNSAR progress was not achieved as initial projected, the activities related to the OMB form development, NSAR v6.1 enhancements and new platform cost-savings approach (NSAP) have provided additional insights into business level requirements and acquisition strategies to support this investment moving forward.  These insights have led to the development of more realistic estimates, scope definition, and performance measures.

The NEDSS standard incorporates interoperable subsystems, components, systems modules, and applications developed and implemented by CDC, state and local health departments, and commercial vendors. NEDSS also establishes the required policy-level agreements on data collection, dissemination, and access in accordance with local, state and federal regulations to ensure protection of the community's confidentiality. NEDSS represents an ongoing collaboration between the CDC and its public health partners. Previously, the NEDSS investment had two reported projects in ProSight, the NEDSS Base System (NBS) and Core Data Provisioning. In late 2014, the Core Data Provisioning project was closed out. This BCR will add a new project that will replace the development funds that were previously in use with Core Data Provisioning. It should also be noted that there has been a reduction in overall operation and maintenance costs for the investment, and those cost have been redirected to be utilized by the new Message Validation, Processing and Provisioning System (MVPS) project as well. The budget is expected to remain stable for the investment at this time. With the evolution of technology, data and exchange standards, CDC now has the opportunity to strengthen and modernize this important public health surveillance system. As part of the CDC Surveillance Strategy, the NNDSS Modernization Initiative (NMI) is underway to enhance the system's surveillance capabilities to provide more comprehensive, timely and higher quality data for public health decision making.

1.        Change in Scope for NBS Releases v5.1 and v5.2: The NBS project team maintains a backlog of system enhancement requests received from NBS users at the state and local public health departments. Some of these enhancement requests are of a higher priority that needs to be addressed immediately to ensure the system’s usability, stability, security and performance.   For NBS release 5.1 and 5.2, there were several items that the jurisdictions using NBS deemed were of high priority that necessitated the change in the scope for the projects to include these new items. 
2.        Change in NBS Cost and Schedule Baseline: Since the scope for the project has changed, the cost and schedule baseline for both NBS 5.1 and 5.2 releases will need to be updated to reflect the new scope. The vendor supporting the project have provided definitive estimates for the project based on the new scope. 
3.        Restructure of NBS Project Activities: Based on feedback from the CDC Enterprise IT Governance committee, the structure of the NBS project activities will be updated to include work deliverables that can be completed within three or more project sprints and also show a more meaningful description of tasks that aligns with how the project is planned, executed and monitored. Previously, the project activities were broken down by the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases.
4.        Align the PHIN VADS investment in ProSight to be included as the NEDSS Investment. PHIN VADS is a completely operational system, and will not be included as a project for monthly cost and schedule reporting in ProSight. PHIN VADS has been funded by the NEDSS investment, and this will show this alignment in ProSight 
5.        Message Validation, Processing and Provisioning System (MVPS) project activities have been updated to reflect current scope and schedule

The two metrics to be updated are as follows: 

#3 - Percentage of the time the monthly HPMS to OIS system feeds are delivered timely.  This would be measured by a successful transaction of the data to Gentran by noon of the day of distribution. 
Change Baseline from: 92%  to 83%
Change Target for CY from: 96% to 92%

#4 - Percent of users with a positive HPMS experience as captured in the satisfaction survey with the HPMS business owner community. 
Change Baseline from: 85% to 60%
Change Target for CY from: 90% to 80% 
Change Reporting Frequency from: Semi-Annual to Annual
 
Rationale: These performance metrics were added to the investment last year.  At that time, CMS had insufficient data in order to establish appropriate baselines and target percentages.  As a result of reporting and tracking these metrics for one fiscal year, CMS has determined that changes are required, as described above, in order to take into account our actual experience and create reasonable target goals.  

CMS has also identified a need to change the reporting frequency for the HPMS Customer Satisfaction Survey (measure #4).  In last year's exhibit, ""annual"" was not provided as an option, so the ""6-month"" interval was selected for this measure.  Since we are now permitted to have annual metrics, CMS will be changing our HPMS customer satisfaction survey to an annual schedule.  Administering the survey on an annual basis will provide adequate time to incorporate user feedback into the system as well as give HPMS users an opportunity to experience the enhancements prior to the subsequent survey period, all of which will contribute to more meaningful survey results.

For FY14, the budget was reduced from $20.013M to $17.280M by $2.733M to align with OMB's budget reduction requirements. FY13 budget was reduced from $20.295M to $16.826M by $3.469M and FY12 was reduced from $21.694M to $17.059M by $4.635M due to change in business priorities and cost efficiency measures.
 
Project Activities Baseline: 
For FY12, the planned costs in Lines 29-32 were modified due to re-prioritization of business needs.

Rebaseline Description:
ALM is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are three (3) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:
Set 1: Rebaseline - other. The following projects a BCE rebaseline event: 
Note - although the funding reduction we are explaining here qualifies as a rebaseline according to the definitions in the BCE guidelines, perhaps this would more accurately be described as a correction since it is primarily due to a data entry error - Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.
FDA ORA ALM Laboratory Management Information Systems (LIMS) Program Management and Technical Coordination (PMTC)
FDA ORA ALM Laboratory Management Information Systems (LIMS) Laboratory Assessment and Pilots (LAP)
FDA ORA Quality Management Information System (QMiS) Support 2
The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved baselined project schedules have been entered.  The costs for these projects required adjustment based on the more detailed activities.  Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.  The project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost.  These adjustments are resulted in changes of more than 10% to cost and are thus being reported as rebaselines.
The original budget for the QMiS Support 2 project was approximately $748,000 and this is now reduced to $509,000.  Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.  The original budget for the LIMS LAP project was $7.522 million and this is now reduced to $6.727 million.  Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.  The original budget for the LIMS PMTC project was $705,000 and this is now reduced to $550,000.   Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.
Set 2: Replan - The following project has a BCE replan event: 
FDA ORA ALM eLEXNET Support 2. 
While there has been an increase in the overall budget of this project resulting from the incorporation of more detailed budgetary information for eLEXNET activities provided by the contractor and a more accurate estimate of program management costs from secondary contractor for this project, this change is below the percent (10%) threshold required for rebaselining.  In this replan, activity descriptions in eLEXNET have been further developed to ensure that they capture more fully the contractual requirements. 
Set 3: Replan (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The summary of funding table was updated on 12/21/2011 to reflect actual obligations for FY2011 as is required by the budgeting process each year.  Only FY2011 values were changed.",,,2000-2014,,,2012-02-24,11:16:57,7441

Set 5. ALM made the following updates/modification to the Operational Performance Metrics: 
- All Metrics had updated CY Targets for FY13
- Metrics 2 related to document control in QMiS was deactivated and removed because the measure was no longer relevant.
- Metric 3 related to measuring national quality factors in QMiS was replaced with a more quantifiable metric of percentage of ORA labs and District Offices using QMS process forms in QMiS. 
- Metric 4 the unit of measure was changed from a percentage to the number of labs.
- Metric 7 - 9 added new metrics for measuring QMiS Processes and Activities. ",2173,Projects,2000-2018,,,2012-09-12,16:11:13,9371

These baseline changes are consistent with FDA direction, the expected path of the program, and with determinations made pertaining to individual projects by both ORA business and OIM IT.  
Rebaseline Description:
MARCS is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are seven (7) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:
Set 1: Rebaseline - change in funding strategy (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The  MARCS Investment is reduced by $4.729M in FY 13 as a result of the requirement from OMB to represent Data Consolidation and IT savings in budget authority (BA) as compared to the FY 2012 Enacted BA.  This cut has been reflected in the summary of funding table for MARCS for FY13.  The DME (excluding planning) costs have been reduced from $12.687M to $10.687M.  The O&M Costs have been reduced from $9.086M to $6.357M.  This is consistent with a recent review of MARCS that was conducted internally within FDA.  While this funding level is being reduced for FY13, the full scope of MARCS has not changed.  Thus, $2.729M is being placed into FY14 DME (excluding planning) costs to increase this from $7.630M to $10.359M and $2.000M is being placed into FY15 DME (Excluding Planning) Costs to increase this from $3.926M to $5.926M.  O&M spending will be constrained in order to emphasize new development in accordance with the FDA internal Technical Status review underway.  O&M cost reductions will be accomplished based on O&M task orders that control the number of releases per year and  defects addressed.
Set 2: Rebaseline - change in scope (E300b, Section B - Projects).  The project FDA ORA MARCS Hardware Acquisition through MARCS 3.1 has been removed from MARCS as the result of a portfolio management decision within FDA.  The costs for this project are now part of the FDA Operational Infrastructure or the FDA Information and Computing Technologies for the 21st Century (ICT21) investments.  This project is being deactivated and removed from MARCS.
Set 3: Rebaseline - other (E300b, Section B - Projects).  The following projects have cost changes of greater than +/- 10%:
FDA ORA MARCS Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental
FDA ORA MARCS Field Work Manager (FWM) 3
The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered.  These changes are greater then the 10% variance as required by OMB and are thus rebaseline changes.
Set 4: Replan (E300b, Section B - Projects).  The following projects have a BCE replan event: 
FDA ORA MARCS Data Integration (DI)
FDA ORA MARCS Firm Management Services (FMS)
FDA ORA MARCS Program Management and Technical Integration (PMTI) 2
FDA ORA MARCS Support Services (SS)
FDA ORA MARCS Work Assignment and Accomplishment Manager (WAAM) 3
The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered.  These changes are all within the 10% variance as required by OMB and are thus replan changes.
Set 5: Replan (E300b, Section B - Projects).  Three additional projects are being added to MARCS.  These are the following:
FDA ORA MARCS Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 3
FDA ORA MARCS Field Work Manager (FWM) 4
FDA ORA MARCS Work Assignment and Accomplishment Manager (WAAM) 4
MARCS uses an iterative approach to development and defines projects as the investment progresses.  ARRMS 3 is being added to build on work from ARRMS 2 Supplemental.  Due to some of the dependencies on COTS availability and potential associated impacts, the scope of ARRMS 3 was not finalized until recently.  FWM 4 and WAAM 4 are being introduced in order to address the hardware and consequent technology changes required by the new Oracle Exadata and Exalogic hardware.  The acquisition and use of this hardware was an FDA level decision.  MARCS has to adjust to accommodate this.  The expected cost of ARRMS 3 is $1.502M.  The expected cost of FWM 4 is $0.546M.  The expected cost of WAAM 4 is $1.155M.  This is a total additional cost of $3.203M.  The total MARCS lifetime cost is expected to be $272.165M.  As this represents 1.18% of the expected lifetime cost of MARCS, which is below the 10% threshold, this is being submitted as a replan.  These are FY12 funds.
Set 6: Replan (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The summary of funding table was updated on 12/21/2011 to reflect actual obligations for FY2011 as is required by the budgeting process each year.  Only FY2011 values were changed.

These baseline changes are consistent with FDA direction, the expected path of the program, and with determinations made pertaining to individual projects by both ORA business and OIM IT.  
Rebaseline Description:
RBIS is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are four (4) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:
Set 1: Rebaseline.  The following projects have a BCE rebaseline event: 
FDA ORA RBIS Data Availability (DA)
FDA ORA RBIS Data Evaluation and Recommendations (DER)
FDA ORA RBIS Data Quality (DQ) 
FDA ORA RBIS Firm Master List Services (FMLS) Enhancements 
FDA ORA RBIS Report Development Support (RDS)
The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered. Additionally, the scope for the RBIS DA, RBIS DER, and RBIS DQ projects has changed, resulting in an increase or decrease to the project lifecycle costs that exceeds 10%.  The contractor has reallocated work between projects, which has resulted to changes in the scope of these projects and led to this variance.  The specific changes to the lifecycle costs of these projects are as follows: the budget of RBIS DA was increased from $1.104 million to $1.635 million.  The budget for the RBIS DER project decreased from $519,000 to $275,000.  The budget for the Data Quality (DQ) project decreased from $822,000 to $582,000.  The budget for the RBIS FMLS Enhancements project decreased from $417,000 to $316,000.  The budget for the RBIS RDS project increased from $1.841 million to $2.085 million.  
The reason for the changes in the costs of the RBIS DA, RBIS DER, and RBIS DQ projects are as follows.  The DA project was intended to pick up later phases of work started under the RBIS Data Warehouse, Data Marts, and Universes (DWDMU) project.  The work accomplished under the DWDMU project led to a larger scope for DA than originally anticipated.  This resulted in an increase in the project's scope.  For the RBIS DQ project, the Contractor was able to leverage Dunn and Bradstreet (D&B) resources more than was originally planned, thus reducing the anticipated cost. The result was a decrease in project costs.  For the RBIS DER project, the contractor received a lower estimate from a subcontractor for work to be done under this project than was expected, resulting in a lower cost.   The project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost
 
In the case of the RBIS FMLS Enhancements and RBIS RDS projects, the overall scope did not change even though the project costs increased or decreased by more than 10%, as is evident from the numerical information provided above.  This is due to primarily to costs associated with integration for FMLS and a higher than anticipated demand for report changes for RDS.  The costs for these projects required adjustment based on the more detailed activities, but the overall scope for each project has not changed and the project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost.

Set 2: Replan.  The following projects have a BCE replan event: 
FDA ORA RBIS Center and External Integration (CER)
FDA ORA RBIS Data Warehouse, Data Marts, and Universes (DWDMU) 
The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered.  These changes are all within the 10% variance as required by OMB and are thus replan changes.
Set 3: Replan (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The summary of funding table was updated on 12/21/2011 to reflect actual obligations for FY2011 as is required by the budgeting process each year.  Only FY2011 values were changed.

The updates reflected two budget changes that occurred late in FY11, after the initial baseline change request had been approved. 
1. The investment incurred additional, unexpected, costs of $1.292 M for Licenses.  This cost increase was reflected in the O&M for FY11, increasing that Prior Year O&M costs from $6.429 to $7.721.
2. The Annual enhancement budget for the two reporting systems had been estimated at $690,000.  A Task Order requisition for needed enhancements was processed; however the vendor estimate was above the expected amount.  The Task Order was awarded at $777K at the end of September.  The FY11 DME was therefore increased by $87K  from $690,000 to $777K. 
 
The combination of these two changes increased projected funding over the lifetime of the investment by $1.379M from $188.598M to $189.977M.  The Summary of Funding table was changed in December to reflect these actual costs for FY11.   However, the FY11 DME baseline activity associated with modifications and enhancements could not be changed to reflect the $87K  increase in funding because that section of ProSight was closed to changes in December.  The changes will be made if the new baseline is approved.

In addition, a major component of the Financial Reporting System (FRS) needs to be replaced and budget formulation functions need to be redeveloped to meet the requirements identified in a major review of FDA's financial planning and execution processes.  The recommendation of a follow-up technical study was to replace the current Hyperion software with a later version of Hyperion and to rebuild much  of the budget planning functionality.  A business case documenting that study has been approved, estimates have been made, and an acquisition is planned for FY15.

All projects that were funded directly have been divested and made their own investment. With this new funding strategy, the EHBs now only consists of projects funded indirectly by the administrative funds for the benefit of all programs.

Guidance received from HHS late in Q2'10 concerning ARRA spending necessitated re-scoping of several of the planned projects and acquisitions. Original planning for RPMS development projects was based on known high-level requirements and needs from IHS programs and application business sponsors. Once funded these projects underwent review, refinement, and requirements definition with input from the stakeholders.  The impact of these considerations has been that the IHS OIT has scaled back on the number and the size of RPMS development and deployment projects that can be expected to be completed during the ARRA timeframe and with ARRA funding.  Furthermore, we have restructured all program lines into which both ARRA and regularly funded RPMS work is categorized. The previous 8 functional areas of work have been revised down to 4 main strategic areas; Practice Management, Patient & Population Health, RPMS Core & Data Exchange, and Operations & Maintenance. FY2010 decreased from 124.492 to 109.496 to reflect a revised amount of 14.468 of RPMS ARRA planned expenses in FY2010; 14.996 of ARRA planned expenses moved to the IHS Infrastructure, Office Automation, and Telecommunications (IOAT) investment. FY2011 decreasing from 105.151 to 93.567 based on the removal of 24.307 of unrealized funding, continuation of the FY10 16.251 funding, and 4.000 of security costs shifted to the Security investment, including standard inflation rates. FY2012 increased to 93.567 to reflect the anticipated straight-line funding from FY11 to FY12. FY13-FY15 reflects an increase based on the revised FY2012 budget, plus a standard 2.2% inflation rate.

The total project lifecycle cost is slightly increased from $7.071M to $7.216M based on original budget. The increase is caused by restart from diverted resources to support the Meaningful Use Stage II Initiative. Additional time was added to this project for core resources and previous Work Order budgets were moved to future months.

Table B.2
Two program task activities for Monitoring and Control are added to reflect the change in timeline for Fiscal Year 2014 Quarters 1 and 2. The ICD-10 project schedule was originally using the compliance date of 10/1/2013. After the compliance date was changed to 10/1/2014, the schedule remained the same as the project was on track to complete by the original compliance date. With the Meaningful Use Stage II project overriding priority, more time is needed to complete the ICD-10 project by the new compliance date.

-          Primary among these is a HRSA-mandated security change which will enhance secure access to the system.  
-          Additionally, there have been unanticipated legislatively-mandated changes required by:
1)     the implementation of Section 1921 of the Social Security Act (SSA), which provides protection from unfit healthcare practitioners to beneficiaries participating in SSA healthcare programs
2)     Implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) legally mandated the merging of HIPDB data into NPDB
3)     On-going system enhancement activities to improve responsiveness and better address the needs of the Data Bank's customers.  New development, modernization, or enhancement services and capabilities next year will consist of: improvement of compliance metrics; implementation of enhanced Informational Website; and evaluation of query pricing
This re-baseline will allow the remainder of the 4th Generation NPDB-HIPDB contract and the associated changes to the development lifecycle to operate in an approved manner under a new baseline for this major IT investment.  Because of these changes to the 4th Generation contract, the current approved system baseline needs to be re-baselined to track cost and schedule accurately for the FFP portion as well as the T&M portion of the contract.  Once this occurs then the NPDB-HIPDB Earned Value Management (EVM) monthly status report will illustrate cost and schedule variances that are more realistic and accurate.
 
There is justification for continuation of the investment under the new baseline for the following reasons:
1.     The current baseline is inaccurate and requires modification.  The current baseline was established over two years ago and remained within established parameters for that length of time.  As of May 30, 2010, taken as a whole, the project has a cost variance of only -2.64% - well within the allowed 10% variance.  However, due to the recently mandated requirement to track both Steady State (SS) and Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DME) separately, the DME portion has now slightly exceeded the -10% threshold.
2.     The current baseline does not include several efforts that were unforeseen at the time the baseline was established.  Of major significance is a security enhancement that was mandated by HRSA after the baseline was in place and therefore was not contained within the budget at that time.  This enhancement, referred to as ""eAuthentication"" will provide for a significantly higher level of information security for the system as a whole by validating users at a higher level of assurance.  In addition, unknown at the time of the original baseline was the recently completed change necessitated by the implementation of Section 1921 of the SSA and upcoming changes implementing the merger of HIPDB data into NPDB required by ACA.
3.     The NPDB-HIPDB contract has been modified to address these security improvements as well as these legislatively mandated requirements.
 
Under the current contract, the system is continuously enhanced to meet legislative and other Government initiatives that reasonably fit the architecture, including expanding the database to include additional data elements and/or add new reports and client categories and functional enhancements.  All functional enhancements to the NPDB-HIPDB IT investment are logical progressions of the current system and undergo the scrutiny of a documented Configuration Change Management process.  The implementation of these enhancements will provide the following strategic, cost, and technical benefits to the Government and user community:
 
1. Strategic Benefits:
S.   Improve service levels (i.e. response time, confidentiality, and IT security).
S.   Increase accuracy.
S.   Increase the ability of health care entities to manage risks inherent in their processes to more effectively utilizing the NPDB system.
 
2. Cost Benefits:
S.   Eliminate or minimize paper forms and other labor-intensive activities.
S.   Eliminate duplication between the Data Banks.
 
3. Technical Benefits:

To streamline reporting, we are adding DART and ICDS costs to the ART investment and are adjusting the ART, DART, and ICDS reporting periods in eCPIC to align with the contract lifecycles for the primary vendors. ",,,2004-2022,,,2015-04-24,13:50:31,22581

Lifecycle budget for investment has been reduced from $48.5M to $38.55M due to fiscal restraints and management decisions concerning competing priorities.  In addition, system environments that are intended to integrate thru IRWIN are also going through changes.

Reduction in budget and external system development will impact the ability to clearly define the physical development of the effort.  A methodical approach for development requires an interative approach that breaks down the components of the project plan and returns to planning to account for external changes that affect overall success.  In addition, a portfolio management of all systems integrated will have to be incorporated to assure that dependent projects that are undergoing their own changes are considered as IRWIN progresses.

BSEE and BOEM seek the improvement of plans and permits business processes and requirements definition.  Through various engagements, bureaus will generate improved processes workflows, applicable performance measures and detailed solution requirements.  

BSEE plans to enhance its ongoing support and maintenance of TIMS through a more structured support contract.  In support of this, BSEE will develop and document a complete set of operations & maintenance requirements develop an acquisition strategy and seek assist with proposal reviews

BSEE and BOEM will evaluate alternatives for the TIMS investment.  Each alternative is to include all costs (assets, resources, plans, etc.) to develop, provision, transition, operate and maintain each alternative as well as retire any existing solutions identified as a result of the alternative implemented.   The rationale is to identify an alternative that will reduce cost, time to deliver, risks and challenges to sustainability.

The UFMS OIG, EOIR, and OPA Migration finished on time and under budget. The project activities that were under budget are: 

 	Activity Number: 8.21, OBD UFMS Development/Conversion Phase 3 
 	Activity Number: 8.22, OBD UFMS Testing Phase 3   completed in 3 weeks, planned for 3 months
 	Activity Number: 8.25, OBD UFMS Value Added Functionality - completed in 2 weeks, planned for 3 months
 	Activity Number: 8.26, OBD UFMS Project Management Phase 3 - 


The project activities above were completed under budget because of applied lessons learned and efficiencies gained from previous migrations. During testing, less effort than planned was needed for ongoing problem report (PR) resolution as no PRs were identified during testing or user validation testing. It was found that in all of these project activities, less effort than planned was needed to complete the activity. The reduced amount from the PBCR will be applied to future large scale migrations where some uncertainties exist associated with organizations  unique activities.

NEW ITERATION - The Department of Justice (DOJ) has an ongoing effort to migrate Components and Offices, Boards, and Divisions (OBD) to Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) that will improve the existing and future financial management and procurement operations across DOJ. The DOJ UFMS migration is a phased approach and each phase is referred to as a  wave.  Each wave may include multiple Offices, Boards, and Divisions, and/or Components. Currently, the DOJ is on wave 2 of the UFMS migration, which includes National Security Division, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, Community Relations Service, and US Parole Commission. This change request is to add the project activity schedules and costs associated with the wave 2 migration. It took longer than anticipated for the schedule to be resource loaded which caused a delay for entering into eCPIC.

The previous scheduled planning period was used to select 10 high priority, high use data sources and a suite of analytic capabilities for Increment 1.  Increment 1 is now underway and is scheduled to go active during the first quarter of FY 2011.  This new effort required the diversion of $6.21M in hardware and additional personnel who normally support tactical response developments to this more strategic effort.  STAO also realigned other resources from other programs to support this new effort.  Because DIVS is a level-of-effort, government-led, government-contractor team program, additional financial resources are expected to be added to DIVS to maintain the pace of future data aggregation, provide sufficient storage capability, and maintain user expected system performance.  These changes will be shown in subsequent reports.  The program office is also developing plans for future increments, future functionality, requirements and risk managment processes, future infrastructure needs, cost estimates, and future system deactivations.  These plans will provide greater clarity during FY 2011.  This DIVS scope change is one of data and data source magnitude.  The purpose of DIVS is unchanged-store FBI lawfully obtained data and present that data  to authorized users via web-based software analytic applications.  OMB personnel were briefed on these changes on May 4 and 7 with a planned follow-on review in October 2010.

As a result, milestone number 84 N-DEx Increment 3 4th Material Order, was deleted and set to Omit Synchronization in the FITDB.  The amount of this milestone was $1,159,000, and while we had applied an estimated actual cost to this milestone, no payment had been expended.

CODIS has been creating software maintenance releases (service packs) while in an O&M phase, to resolve defects in the fielded CODIS 7.0 baseline and address minor change requests to promote usability in the field.  The latest service pack to complete Government Acceptance Testing is Service Pack 6 (SP6.)  This PBCR adds the SP6 deployment iteration as a new project (002501U, Activities 49 through 49.2.8.)  Deployment of service packs to domestic laboratories is coordinated on a regional basis by the CODIS Operations support contractor, and entails the distribution of installation media followed by remote installation support.  Due to the hierarchical (national-state-local) structure of the CODIS software and the flow of profile data and system messaging (matches, other,) the timing of these deployments must be carefully coordinated.  Deployment has begun and is expected to complete in Spring 2016.  As this contract is firm fixed price, no cost variance is expected.

The CODIS Program has also awarded the first of two six-month option periods on an Engineering Services task order for the Software Maintenance support contractor to integrate automated testing methodologies within the software build process to mitigate risk and provide long-term cost savings related to manual software testing efforts.  This is part of existing project 002501S (Activity 11,) adding activities and costs, and extending the overall completion date of the project from November 2015 to June 2016.  Contractor is automating testing for functional requirements.  These functional requirements were collected and grouped (each grouping is referred to as a ""stack"") by the Government and prioritized for integration.  This option period adds five additional sub-activities within Activity 11 (11.9 through 11.13.)  Integration of the automated tests for each stack is priced as its own firm fixed price, therefore no cost variance is anticipated.

These automated tests provide a sharp increase in test coverage and help to promote code quality, decrease the volume of defects, and mitigate overall risk in terms of code stability.  The CODIS build process currently includes the execution of over 2000 such tests, which run in a continuous integration (CI) process whenever code is checked in (developed or modified.)  These tests therefore run several times per day during development, equivalent to countless man-hours of testing which would be cost-prohibitive to perform manually.  A failure of an automated test triggers a workflow in which the developer must revert and fix their code to achieve test passage.  This provides immediate detection of issues that would otherwise remain latent until full system and acceptance testing upon completion of an enhancement or release.  This greatly reduces the effort for software rework, as the complexity of troubleshooting one issue requires limited effort vs. a release's worth of accumulated defects.  Task order will follow an Agile development framework using Scrum.  Contractor will develop and implement tests according to latest Government prioritization.  Task order is fully funded through ""no year"" DME funding for FY17 and FY18, as well as some remaining FY16 ""no year"" DME funds.   Task order organizes the work into Government-prioritized Requirement groups (lettered A through J,) which correspond to specific areas of the CODIS software that are currently not covered or not sufficiently covered by automated tests implemented to date.  See table B.2.2.   

Task order is 18 months, fixed price at $2.6M.  Contractor commenced work with a shortened sprint of task order planning, and is moving on to test development.  Requirement groupings have a planned duration of 2 to 4 development sprints of 4 weeks each.  Each requirement grouping consists of planning, development, and acceptance, which results in overlap of the activities identified in Table B.2.2.  Business analysts perform the planning for a requirement grouping and pass the epics and user stories on to the developers to implement, while the BAs move on to planning the next requirement grouping's epics and user stories.",14699,"Projects, Activities",1998-2025,,,2017-05-15,18:04:01,26976

CODIS 9.0 Development - extending period of performance (adding sprints,) establishing a more realistic cost baseline to reset significant cost underburn, and releveling planned epics to ensure completion of all development objectives for the CODIS 9.0 release, and to account for epics added via decomposition/progressive elaboration during execution.  The result is a later final project completion date, slightly higher count of planned epics, and lower total project cost.

Automated Testing - no change to project cost or completion date; merely administrative change to split some activities whose duration would have extended beyond the six-month limit set for eCPIC table B.2.2, because of a change in Contractor's execution approach.

This exploratory project began with canvassing system stakeholders about what they would like to see in a new NCIC system.  Nearly four months into the project significant obstacles and delays were encountered due to compliance with the Office of Management and Budget's Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).  This PRA oversight had not been previously applicable to any other survey's or canvasses undertaken by the CJIS Division and resulted in delays totaling approximately 7 months.  Additionally, during this time period, new personnel were assigned to the project resulting in better analysis and support for estimating project activities and timelines.  To correct these scheduling delays, and update the project schedule with better, more descriptive activities and timeframes, the NOPU is submitting a Performance Baseline Change Request (PBCR).

CIB Project Close Out PBCR:
The CIB addresses an FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division initiative for providing innovative methods for exchanging, timely, accurate, and relevant criminal justice information with Federal, State, Tribal, and Local law enforcement agencies, as well as criminal justice agencies worldwide.  The initiative is a solution for satisfying the needs and requirements of the CJIS stakeholder community, both internal and external to CJIS, by providing a tool that will improve CJIS s process  performance, enhance technical capabilities for sharing information, reduce turn around time for CJIS products and special requests for information, divert lower priority  reporting  traffic away from mission critical systems, and reduce operation costs.

CIB Increment 1 activities include:
Enterprise File Transfer Service (EFTS)
Providing NCIC Extract data on EFTS
Enable EFTS Web Page Interface with LEEP Authorization

Since you are asking for Release info, we are switching from Epics to Features.  We need until Monday COB to pull the correct data on the features planned vs completed for Release 1a.  And planned for Release 1b.

Sorry for the delay in requesting the extension, the internal tracking of features will be easier for USMS reporting on the OMB300.

The project completed its adoption of the Agile methodology and identified a comprehensive product backlog that cannot be completed by the current planned finish date under the project's performance velocity.  The IPS investment also identified the need to change technology due to Adobe discontinuing its support for Flash-based technologies.  Additionally, due to a change in BLS priorities, IPS was impacted by a shift in resources out of and within the investment and the Industrial Price Joint Oversight Board (IPJOB) decided the impact of the shift of resources out of the investment would primarily fall on the IPS Initiation project.  The IPP Estimation project will continue at the current resource levels, plus the addition of IPS Initiation project resources, until coding for its major production deliverable, scheduled for the end of FY 2016, is completed.

At the same time, Microsoft announced the removal of Flash from its browsers, as of January 1, 2021. This is a significant and time-critical risk to the IPS investment because fifteen IPS production applications have a client-tier that consists of Adobe Flash. IPS had to rethink its rebaseline strategy based on this new risk. The new FY 2018 rebaseline decelerates the IPS Initiation project in order to redirect resources to the Flex-to-HTML5 conversion of the critical production applications. Unless these applications are converted by the end of 2020, the IPS Collection, Estimation, and Publication Systems will fail as of January 2021, and both the PPI and IPP programs will be unable to produce and disseminate timely, accurate, and relevant information on price changes in the economy. The work to address the discontinuation of Adobe Flash-based technology is the primary cause for the rebaseline.

A secondary driver for the rebaseline is a decline in resources available to the IPS investment as a result of government-wide reform on the size of the federal workforce. The decline represents a reduction in developer work hours of approximately 10% from the baseline.  The reduction severely impacted the IPS Initiation project as Initiation resources were first redirected to the Estimation project and other maintenance priorities then, in FY 2018, to the Flex-to-HTML5 conversion. The IPS Initiation project has experienced a trend of increasing negative schedule variances due to the changing priorities and extension of requirements. Scope increased by approximately 12%, as evidenced in additions to the product backlog, since the FY 2016 rebaseline. 

These factors change the scope of the current IPS Initiation baseline, including major milestones, and causes the current project end date to be unattainable. In order to address these issues, IPS has restructured maintenance and development teams and re-allocated existing resources to align with program priorities. The investment has also identified a number of changes to its hybrid Agile methodology to incorporate lessons learned and improve project efficiency. 

This justification has been approved by senior executives and investment sponsors David Friedman, the Associate Commissioner for OPLC, and Wesley Chou, the Acting Associate Commissioner for OTSP.",16694,"Projects, Activities",2002-2027,,,2018-09-20,14:09:01,28661

To accomplish this, Secretary Solis has formulated a series of strategies for reforming worker protection at the Labor Department With new challenges and new directions there has been a redirection of system scope and functionality to better align the OIS with the Department of Labor's recently released Strategic Plan and the Secretary Solis outcome goals.
To accomplish these goals OIS system requirements need to be modified and enhanced to address the revised functionality.  For example, OSHA's methodology for penalty calculations for violators of occupational safety and health rules and regulations has been significantly modified and therefore the OIS has been redesigned to capture and accurately calculate these important changes.  Another example of significant functionality change is the addition of a new critical agency program called the Severe Violators Enforcement Program (SVEP). Similar redesign of the OIS has occurred to incorporate this new and important program.
Also, data migration and data cleansing of OSHA's legacy occupational safety and health data has incurred considerably greater resources to accomplish.  One of the goals of the new OIS is to provide more accurate historical occupational safety and health data to the public, to other Executive Branch departments, and to the Congress.
As a result of the new challenge, new directions, requirement updates, architecture modifications and additional training requirements for the key stakeholders, OSHA senior management understands that OIS needs additional funding as well as an adjustment to the deployment schedule. The impact of these changes has caused the life-cycle costs to go from $84 million to $91 million.  These factors have also resulted in the additional funding of $3.1 million for FY10 and 11, as well as the need to increase federal resources in FY11 and out years. In addition, the BY12 and out years reflect an increase in FTEs based on the organizations need to manage OIS increased functionality.  The deployment schedule will be adjusted from October 2010 to March 2011

Due to a legislative mandate the AMS investment’s planned work on ACA releases (7.0 and 7.1) was reduced.  Government FTE's that were planned to work on the ACA projects will now work on the AMS investments Operations and Maintenance (O&M) projects.  AMS lowered the planned costs for the AMS Design & Development Release 2.17.01 for ACA work not being performed.  Additionally, the O&M work was increased that added funding to the AMS Midyear Release 2.16.07 project; therefore, AMS is requesting to realign these funds to account within the AMS investment to accomplish these actions.
The AMS Midyear Release 2.16.07 project will complete some operations and maintenance tasks because of the reduction of ACA work.  The deliverables include: Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTs):  BRAVA! v.16 (HTML5version)/BLAZON Print Service; Solaris OS hardware to Linux OS virtual servers and Windows 2003 servers to Windows Server 2012 virtual servers;  product modifications to align with mandated n/n-1 versions of software; the application Java code is being modified from Java 1.6 to Java 1.8 to ensure tighter security standards.
AMS Design & Development Release Project 2.17.01 deliverables currently include continuation of hardware/COTS/code upgrade activities, preparation for filing season 2017 and operations and maintenance modifications in support of the ACA.
The AMS investment needs to realign the project life cycle costs as follows:
•	AMS Midyear Release 2.16.07 project life cycle cost is being revised from $6,135,575 to $7,917,969 resulting in an increase of $1,782,394.
•	AMS Design & Development Release 2.17.01 project life cycle cost is being revised from $4,421,717 to $2,639,323 resulting in a decrease of $1,782,394.

As a result, the FRBR lost 13 staff members on the ASAP investment in operations and development (53% of developers, 50% of operations and development testers, and 100% of IT specialized resources).  This significant external event impacted ASAP's ability to deliver scope within the time frames and costs published internally to approving governance boards and externally in the Ex. 300b.  

Additionally, the abrupt loss of development staff forced ASAP to immediately change its development strategy in order to meet future Enterprise Architecture and Mainframe Migration deadlines.  EA and MM development work will be combined into one DME stream to take best advantage of remaining resources and known efficiencies.  This correction BCR is to bring the Ex. 300b baseline in-line with the reduction in staff and changes to ASAP's development strategy to meet critical deadlines.

(Side note: the resources and scope of 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 were moved to 1.4 in the May/June BCR since we were attempting to simplify our processes by moving from two to one development streams.) 

What we have done in this BCR is remove all elements of 1.2 (meaning 1.2 itself as well as the remaining child activities 1.2.1 and 1.2.2) and replace them with one activity (1.10) that reflects what we intended for 1.2 in the May/June BCR.

Since the previous budget submission, the FRBR changed their staffing plan to expedite the release of contractors who were brought on for the mainframe migration (MM) effort and were expected to be maintained through 2014 to ensure postponed EA and O&M upgrade development efforts were implemented timely.  After review of the critical development requirements post MM, the FRBR decided to stagger the release of the contractors considerably sooner than planned.  Additionally, the fully-loaded hourly rate for ITAD employees decreased $6.00 from the previous estimate.  Taken together, these changes account for the $2.05M decrease in budget estimates for FY 2014.

As for FYs 2015-2017, previous budget submissions did not include DME milestones/funding because future direction/scope of ASAP was unknown past FY 2014 when ASAP's current budget was established in 2009/2010 upon completion of its AA/CBA. Current strategic decisions for ASAP have outlined mandatory development efforts in FYs 2015-2017 to ensure EA and security compliance, as well as to add new enhancements and interfaces to ensure execution of Fiscal Service's priority objectives for the transparency of grant data, automation of debt ceiling procedures, and collection of delinquent debt.  The additional milestones for FYs 2015-2017 account for a significant portion of the additional $20.89M requested.  The rest is due to changes at the new KFC operational center for the investment.

Lastly, the previous budget submission did not include changes at KFC for ASAP. KFC anticipates increasing their staff to support the additional production requirements and objectives.  This accounts for the additional $337,554 requested in FY 2018.  (NOTE:  Additional changes to Fiscal Services' portion of the baseline are anticipated starting in FY 2014 due to the very recent decision to move ASAP development from headquarters to KFC.  A new staffing plan at KFC has not been determined at this point to support this change so this decision is not reflected in this BCR.)

However, the EVM trend information has indicated that select projects are trending towards exceeding those thresholds. FinCEN performed an internal program review and confirmed that the BSA IT Mod technical architecture remains sound. However, based on the detailed projects review and lessons learned, there needs to be some schedule adjustments and cost realignment. One key lesson learned that is causing some of the milestones to be extended is moving from a waterfall approach to testing to a more iterative approach. FinCEN is now designing/building the system of record by BSA form then performing unit test on each form type before developing the next form. This iterative approach in the development and testing will help ensure all the business rules and data mapping is done correctly prior to data conversion.  Because of the dependency on the system of record, the Query system milestone has also shifted by two months, plus the project requires additional time to build a staging area to load all of the BSA data prior to populating the Query system. E-filing Release 2 has been broken up into three iterations, with the first being complete in December with the final dynamic or wizard version of the new SAR and CTR being complete in June 2012. The three projects that make up the Broker Information Exchange capabilities (Financial Intelligence Repository, Contact/Customer Management, and 314b) have been combined into one milestone because they will most likely share the same technology platform.  Moreover, the milestone date has shifted by one quarter in FY13 because of the budget allocation by fiscal year.

Another reason for the BCR is to realign costs.  Some milestones have been complete and came in under cost, so these costs have been shifted to other, ongoing projects. Also, after a year into the Program, further cost estimating has been performed and subsequent refinements need to be made.

The scope for the ""Broker Information Exchange"" project milestone originally included the full suite of capabilities to begin creating/managing/storing project work items, building a contact/customer management system, and streamlining the process for financial institutions to collaborate/share information.  As part of this BCR, FinCEN is now planning to split the original project into two releases. The first release will focus on implementing the technical Sharepoint foundation for this project and implementing functionality to first support investigative cases, which constitute roughly 85 percent of FinCEN work items and processing.   The second release will focus on delivering the information exchange functions and capabilities needed to support the remaining FinCEN processes.     ",,,2010-2020,,,2013-04-19,10:11:57,13003

This increases costs by $75K and adds 30 days to the schedule. The three projects being added to the Portfolio include: Secure Information Sharing System Enhancements (SISS), Graphene and Geofin Tools, and Entity Resolution Capabilities. The SISS effort aims to enhance the system’s 314a and 314b capabilities and improve efficiencies through automation by adding functionality and streamline workflow capabilities, integrating and enhancing 314b admin capabilities into the SISS application, and improving usability and work processes for the 314a admin capabilities. Graphene and Geofin will deploy the DARPA-developed Graphene and Geofin systems for FinCEN's analysts by integrating the tool into the current environment and loading all of the BSA seed data.

TS2 continues to build on planning work done in Fiscal Year 2013, revising the engineering analyses to develop the TS2 Release Plan which will define the timeline for delivering the overall program milestones.

The Penalty & Interest project (Filing Season 2014 and 2015) addresses GAO Unpaid Assessment Financial Material Weakness related to individual taxpayer accounts; increases consistency of penalty and interest calculations on the master files (BMF and IMF) and IDRS; enhances the common code base, improves accuracy and reduces the burden to employees when responding to taxpayer inquiries related to penalty and interest.

The Database Conversion project captures and applies all IMF annual conversion changes to the CADE 2 database at the end of each processing year while retaining the CADE 2 database historical data.

Specifically, this BCR:
Renames the TS2 project to TS2 Planning and Infrastructure and shortens the completion date to 12/15/2014.  The Database Sustainability, and TS2 milestone 2 activities are deleted; and the P&I and Penalty and Interest activities are renamed and realigned to the P&I early delivery project.  In addition, the completion date of the Milestone 0-1 activity is extended to include additional engineering analysis.
Adds the TS2 Early Delivery-P&I project, that includes the two previously renamed (MY2013 and FS2014) activities, and adds two new activities to reflect the FS2015 releases.

At that time, one of those projects, Feed to Integrated Production Model (IPM),  which utilizes the agile System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Methodology, had very early design and development activities identified. The planning for phase one of this project occurred before the design was fully known, therefore the estimates used at that time were made prior to the design being fully identified. The reduction in the estimate is based a combination of factors: 

1. The elimination of a more complex portion of the IPM design, the Change Data Capture (CDC)/incremental update. The CDC portion of the design is being deferred to a future phase.
2. Information gained since the original estimate resulted in a reduction in the total resources needed to complete the activities.
3. Further analysis of requirements reveals that some of the tasks allocated to contractor labor will need to be performed by government staff, which will be hired at a lower cost.

The risks associated with the Project/Activity are as follows:
- Resources: No resource risks are identified due to the reduction in planned costs and schedule, as the cost reduction was a result of overestimation of the cost and schedule due to initial planning of the project before the design was fully known. Information gained since the original estimate resulted in a reduction in the total resources needed to complete the activities.
- Cost: No risks to cost have been identified due to the reduction in planned costs, from $16.500M to $2.276M, as the cost reduction was a result of overestimation of the cost in the early planning stages of the project before the design was fully known. Further analysis of requirements reveals that some of the tasks allocated to contractor labor will need to be performed by government staff, which will be hired at a lower cost. 
- Schedule: No risks to schedule are identified due to the reduction in planned schedule from 3/31/2016 to 1/31/2016, as the CDC portion of the design is being deferred to a future phase.",12631,"Projects, Activities",2009-2022,,,2016-02-12,13:42:45,24748

Percentage of taxpayer refund information processed daily and updated to the Web within 24 hours. The targets are being revised and will no longer be seasonal.

The unit of measure is stated as ‘CADE 2 will provide daily updates for web-based applications for individual taxpayers’. The current formula used to calculate this metric is a comparison of daily and weekly accounts. This formula does not convey the intent of the metric. The intent of this metric is to ensure CADE 2 performance enhances taxpayer service as we move towards more advanced web-based applications. The expectation is that our web-based applications utilized by taxpayers will have data from CADE 2 within 24 hours. The Business Unit believes that this metric should be calculated and executed in the same manner as the Daily Updates to IDRS performance metric. Both metrics should reflect a measure of performance, and the data within the CADE 2 Statistics Report does not provide performance
analytics. Any issues with data that is not provided to web-based applications will be tracked through the Knowledge Incident/Problem Service Asset Management (KISAM) ticket process, just as data provided to IDRS. Therefore, this BCR requests that monthly targets and thresholds for the Faster Updates to Account Information that is Provided in Support of Web-Based Applications metric be changed.

To clarify, a successful “timely” day means that the taxpayer’s information will be available faster and updated within 24 hr. period on web-based applications. For example, if there are 30 days in a month and CADE 2 updates WMR timely 29 out of 30 days, then 29/30 and the result for that month would be 97%. This would be a better assessment of the intent of the metric which is stated in the metric definition of “The percentage of business days in which updates to web-based applications are processed within 24 hours by CADE 2”. Now the formula matches the exact definition of the metric. At this time, there is only one downstream system that would apply to this metric and that is Where’s My Refund (WMR).",,Metrics,2009-2022,,,2016-03-17,18:52:30,25038

The following changes are requested to reflect recently deployed TS2 functionality, as well as updated targets for an existing metric.  In addition performance categories and top metrics will be updated.  The changes are as follows:

1. Faster Refunds. The percentage of business days refunds (paper and electronic) were processed timely.-The performance measurement category mapping will be updated from Strategic and Business Results to Financial Performance and the targets were updated to reflect seasonality.  This will be a top metric.
2. Daily Updates to IDRS. The percentage of business days in which updates to IDRS are processed within 48 hours by CADE 2.
3. Faster Updates to account information which measures the percentage of taxpayer refund information processed daily and updated to the Web within 24 hours. This metric will be replaced, the new metric is:  CADE 2 Production Validation. The production validation to ensure the data in the CADE 2 database matches the data in Individual Master File (IMF). This measure tracks the number of times the data does not validate.  The Performance Measurement Category mapping will be updated from Financial Performance to Strategic and Business Results.
4. CADE 2 Database. The percentage of business days in which the Service is pointing to CADE 2 data in lieu of the Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) files which is how Individual Masterfile (IMF) data is stored/viewed. If CADE 2 data is not available, services will point to VSAM instead of CADE 2. This is a measure of whether or not CADE 2 data is available for Individual Master File Online (IMFOL) on a daily basis.  The targets and thresholds will be updated for this metric to reflect current performance levels. This will be a top metric.
5. Data Analytics. Percentage of timely modernized updates provided to Integrated Production Model/Operational Data Store (IPM/ODS) for analytics. This is a measure of whether or not CADE 2 data is available for IPM/ODS as designed.  This metric will be replaced with the following metric: Feed to IPM.

The Debit Gateway processes electronic check and Automated Clearing House (ACH) debit transactions it receives from other FMS systems (Pay.gov, PCC OTC, OTCnet, ECP (GLN and tax lockboxes) and, eventually, EFTPS) and federal agencies. This results in the depositing of funds in the Treasury. The Gateway replaces a number of unnecessarily duplicative solutions in favor of a single, dedicated application. In so doing, the Debit Gateway benefits agencies by providing better service, and benefits FMS by doing so at a reduced cost. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) operates the Debit Gateway as Fiscal Agent.

The Debit Gateway relies on commercial off-the-shelf software from the vendor U.S. Dataworks as its core. Custom code allows this COTS product to support Treasury's unique collection. Core maintenance and custom code development are currently the vendor's responsibility under contract to FRBC. 

In response to the vendor's financial difficulties (and, secondarily, concerns with the vendor's custom code development performance), the decision was taken in January 2012 to transition development responsibility to FRBC over a 12-18 month period. This transition will result in increased costs in FY12 and FY13 as FRBC adds resources, but ultimately produce savings once completed due to lower resource costs vs. the current vendor. Current baseline and proposed Debit Gateway lifecycle costs ($ mil.):

FY12 $11.721, Proposed $12.393, Change +5.7%; 
FY13 $10.743, Proposed $11.790, Change +9.8%; 
FY14 $10.553, Proposed $9.932, Change -5.9%; 
FY15 $11.065, Proposed $10.546, Change -4.7%; 
FY16 $11.213, Proposed $9.474, Change -15.5%; 
FY17 $10.586, Proposed $9.572, Change -9.6%; 
FY18 $10.012, Proposed $9.282, Change -7.3%. 
Total FY12-18: $75.893, Proposed $72.990, Change -3.8%.

A delay in implementing R1.4 (Adjustments, Corrections & Reversals) due to a high number of defects in vendor-delivered code has resulted in a need to delay the start and implementation of R1.5 (NACHA Rules). Delaying R1.5 permits full resource concentration on R1.4 defect correction in order to implement in production by 6-30-12. Further, the schedule for R1.6 (EFTPS) in FY13 will also change as a result before getting back to the planned schedules for Releases 1.7 (Same-day ACH processing) and 1.8 (Straight-through processing).",,,2008-2018,,,2012-07-31,23:11:02,8857

DMIS/Treasury Report on Receivables is a system that enables Federal agencies to transmit their non-tax receivable information to Bureau of the Fiscal Service (FS) via Internet and enables FS to monitor agency compliance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. The project IDMS is also being added to the FedDebt investment. IDMS has been in operation since 1999 and currently supports 632 internal users in 16 configurations at seven locations throughout the United States. IDMS provides customers Digital Document Storage and Retrieval, Digital Business Process, and Records Management Solutions for United States Treasury, FS internal customers. Both IDMS and DMIS/TROR integrate and support Treasury Offset Program as well as Cross Servicing. Previously, IDMS and DMIS/TROR were reported outside of the FedDebt Investment. After further analysis, these two systems should be transitioned under FedDebt, benefiting the Investment because of their integration with other systems inside the Investment.

Due to changes in requirements from the Bureau of Fiscal Services's customer (IRS) the scope of the project has changed significantly and the new dates for starting and finishing the project are 4/30/13 and 08/30/14 and the budget has increased to $4.04 Million. As a result the Bureau of Fiscal Service is requesting to modify the investment baseline to reflect these new requirements.  In addition, the project start date was delayed as the Identity Proofing application hosted by the IRS was not available until January 2013.  This proofing application was critical to finalizing the requirements for the interface with the IRS and the project as a whole.   In addition, when the Exhibit 300 was initially submitted a Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) was not included for FY2015 and FY2016.  As this cost increase is defined in the Financial Agency Agreement between Fiscal Service and Bank of America it is necessary to add these costs.    After an initial three month pilot deployment, the success of the pilot will be evaluated and a marketing plan based on those results will be generated.   Based on this marketing plan an estimate for the increase in transactions will be created.  This estimate will allow us to plan for the increase in O&M costs associated with this effort.

1) All FY18 plans were entered incorrectly. Parent child relationships were established when there shouldn't be any. This BCR will delete R29.1, 29.2 and 29.4 projects. They will be added back in via a Replan BCR once this BCR is processed.

2) The Resiliency Physical Redundancy activity under the R28.6 project is being deleted because it's a duplicate of the R29.4 project in the FY18 plans.

3) R28.7 and R29.3 project activities need to be deleted for incorrect parent child relationships and for the reasons below: 

R28.7- R28.7 started on-time in September 2017. In early November, the project encountered configuration issues which impacted the November 9th implementation date. Specifically, errors were found within the configuration scripts of the new MQ environment. At that time, the program made the decision to table efforts for R28.7 due to the impending mandatory code freeze which ran from December thru mid-January. Once the code freeze was lifted, the program intended to shift focus back to assessing R28.7 but must now support debt ceiling efforts. 

R29.3- In October 2017, prior to the project start date of November 1st, an assessment was conducted where several security dependencies were identified. The dependencies exist in the new environment that's being built for the production and testing server refresh efforts. As with R28.7, the program made the decision to table efforts for R29.3 due to the mandatory code freeze, and now in support of the debt ceiling. The program will assess the dependencies at a later date and determine when R29.3 can start.",14900,"Projects, Activities",1996-2016,,,2018-03-06,16:13:33,28047

The ISRP workstation refresh was authorized, funded and initiated last June (2010) and completed in December 2010. Due to a variety of reasons, ISRP was initially confined to reporting the FY10 costs of the Workstation Refresh against the existing FY10 Operations and Maintenance milestone, and the residual FY11 costs against the existing FY11 Operations and Maintenance milestone until such time as the new Workstation Refresh milestone could be added to the milestone plan in February 2011. By then, ISRP was locked into adding the new milestone reflecting the full, original estimated cost even though most of the actual costs had already been expended and reported in FY10. Once the Workstation Refresh BCR was uploaded to the OMB IT Dashboard in February 2011, ISRP reduced its FY11 Operations and Maintenance milestone actual costs by the amount that had been expended this FY on the workstation refresh and reported those costs ($218,496) against the newly added Workstation Refresh milestone. The changes being made with this correction BCR (a) correct (reduce) the actual costs of the FY10 Operations and Maintenance milestone by the amount of the FY10 workstation refresh actuals, (b) corrects the Workstation Refresh start dates, and (c) corrects the total actual cost and the actual percent complete for the Workstation Refresh milestone.",,,,241.944,2017-09-30,2011-05-13,14:40:49,6016

Last summer when we were building our BY13 Exhibit 300 (E300), there was uncertainty as to how ACA was going to work. Our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) organization issued control charts that did not contain ACA funding saying ""FY2012 and FY2013 do not include ACA since we do not have the status/treatment of that program at this time."" ISRP expected to do some work in support of ACA and, with the expectation they would be receiving ACA funding at some point, we created a $20K place-holder project in our E300 for ACA-related tax form changes. Then, this past January (2012), our CFO issued updated control charts depicting ACA funding being pulled out from various Exhibit 53 line items and consolidated under ACA with a transmittal message saying that the ACA funding was being consolidated. Once we realized that ISRP was not going to receive any ACA funding, the ACA ""place holder"" project in ISRP's E300 should have been removed. 

Based on this explanation, ISRP is now seeking Treasury's support for this Correction BCR to remove the ACA project from ISRP's baseline. We need to get this processed before our BY14 E300s are submitted to OMB so that this project isn't erroneously perpetuated in ISRP's baseline next year.",,,,,,2012-08-29,16:00:33,9045

We did so based on instruction to include at least 1 project in our E300 even though, at the time, we had no basis for estimating the cost of the work that was to be based on legislation that hadn't yet been issued. ISRP's legislative updates evolve into work requests only after our business partners evaluate the legislation and determine what changes need to be made. The business then submits WRs to ISRP and ISRP submits them to its contractor who subsequently provides a cost estimate for the work. If we don't know what work needs to be done, much less how much it's going to cost, we shouldn't have established a place holder project in last year's E300, and certainly not in this year's E300.

Since that time, Treasury has conceded that place holder projects should not have been included in our baseline and we should have established this project only after the legislation was issued and we had meaningful basis for estimating the cost and timing of the work.  
 
With that background in mind, this baseline change seeks to (1) delete the Late 2012 Legislative WR activity, (2) correct the planned amount and timing of the Timely 2012 Legislative WR activity, and (3) delete the Legislative Tax Form Changes project for Filing Season 2014 since it represents a place holder that should not have been included in the recent E300 submission. We will add a Filing Season 2014 Legislative Tax Form Changes project next summer after we know what work needs to be done and how much it's going to cost. 

In conclusion, this correction BCR is being submitted based on guidance from Treasury regarding placeholders and the need to reflect accurate planning and performance.

Functionality
Existing Functionality: Existing functionality includes infrastructure, hosting, help desk, content management, search, and reporting solution in a client/server environment.
Proposed Change to Planned Functionality: The objective of the new portal project is to replace obsolete technical environment with current technology by competitively acquiring managed serves for the establishment and management of a new infrastructure, hosting, help desk, content management, search, and reporting solution, and the transition of the existing portal capabilities and services to the new IRS Web environment transparent to external users.

Life Cycle Costs: The current baseline's life cycle cost is $220.586M.  The proposed baseline's life cycle cost is $243.646M.  The lifecycle costs increased $23.06M. 

Cost Change:
TOTAL Change ($23.06M)

Recommendation: This baseline change request thoroughly describes the changes being made, and has been properly vetted through the appropriate internal governance channels. Treasury CPIC recommends Treasury CIO approval.

The current Release 8 (MS5) baseline includes a $3M contingency for additional hardware/software upgrades and contractor support in the event that MeF experienced any performance issues this filing season. MeF is pleased to report that the system is performing as expected and the $3M contingency is no longer needed, so the scope & associated costs are being reduced accordingly.  

This baseline change seeks to incorporate Release 9 (R9) into our baseline. R9, planned for Filing Season 2014, was originally planned to add the U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts (1041) form to the MeF environment. Last February (2012), IRS governance approved the deferral of the Employment/Tax family of forms (94x) from Release 8 and added it to Release 9. More recently, a new Return Review Program (RRP) interface was added along with additional scope to maintain system forms in compliance with IRS mandated XML standards.

The change being proposed to our Top 3 metrics continues to satisfy Treasury's requirement for a minimum of one Top 3 metric to be Business Results-focused and emphasizes the significance of our Print Request metric.  Providing print images to Revenue Agents (RA) and Taxpayer Service Representatives (TSR) supports IRS's Strategic Goal to ""enforce the law to ensure everyone meets their obligation to pay taxes"".  RA's and TSR's need access to taxpayer documents, 721,825,639 of which are stored in the SCRIPS Archive Database as of 12/31/2012.  Providing the images via requests from the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) allows SCRIPS to help the IRS meet that goal.  It is also an excellent measure of the health of the SCRIPS system and its ability to accurately store, index, and retrieve taxpayer submissions.  

The aforementioned changes are also due, in part, because the Docs-Per-Hour metric is difficult to compute and predict, and further complicated by a seasonal complexity.",,,1993-2019,,,2013-02-05,14:26:00,12139

TS1 R1.0 will include Release 1.0 and Filing Season 2015 updates and will complete on March 20, 2015.

The Governance decision was based on Budgetary and staffing constraints, cost increases and schedule delays which placed delivery of full TS1 scope in time for Filing Season (FS) 2014 at risk, and the need to evaluate alignment with senior leadership's new strategic vision for identity theft and fraud detection.

The RRP funding is secured.

RRP new technology for TS1 consisted of GreenPlum, FICO Blaze Advisor, SAS Analytics, and Pivotal Data Computing Appliances (DCAs) which had a cost increase of $27.4M.  TS1 cost increase for contractors was approximately $32.4M.  RRP TS1 new hardware consisted of Data Computing Appliance (DCA) with an approximate cost of $3.9M.  RRP TS1 Filing Season (FS) work includes core record layout changes, rule and model changes, and the Identify Theft expansion.  TS1 FS work cost approximately $4M.

In response to significant delays in vendor development work in the Spring of 2017, the TITAN program commissioned an in-depth review of the root cause of the delays in order to develop a revised delivery strategy. The findings from this assessment concluded that the vendor had significantly underestimated the complexity of scope and time required for the development effort. Furthermore, a lack of agile expertise and an inexperienced leadership team on the vendor side, as well as technical start-up challenges with developer toolsets and environments had also contributed to the initial delays.  This analysis resulted in a revised development strategy, which included doubling the number of vendor development teams to four, onboarding a new vendor leadership team and subject matter experts, front-loading foundational design and architecture components to drive re-use in development, and adding additional development iterations to the project. This strategy was presented to the Auction EOC who voted to approve the revised approach on 3/9/2018.  This BCR aligns the project cost and schedule with the estimates approved with this vote. The BCR introduces additional development iterations to the current year baseline (Iteration 15a-20a), and delays the start of the QA testing activity (from 5/1/2018 to 9/7/2018).",15803,"Projects, Activities",2005-2025,,,2018-07-27,12:52:32,28423

- Removed DME 2 - ETS2 Contract - GSA has been unable to meet the award deadline for the new ETS contract due to protests on the master contract award.  Therefore, it is estimated that this project will be delayed until FY13.
- Removed DME 4 - Contract Writing System - The contract for the new Procurement Contract Writing System was awarded to our current vendor (Compusearch).  Therefore, the milestone for transitioning to a new procurement/contract writing system is no longer required.
- Added a Consolidated DME as these components are being managed as one project which includes:
  a. DME 1 (R12)
  b. DME 3 (Oracle Projects Module)
  c. Removed costs associated with US Mint core financial system upgrade to R-12 due to customer requested delay.
  d. Added estimated costs associated with US Mint SaaS project integration.
In addition, the reductions to the original DME#1 reflects a delay in the US Mint instance upgrade due to a new US Mint priority (the US Mint has requested our assistance in integrating a new Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) solution for their Integrated Retail Information System (IRIS) with our Oracle E-Business Suite).

The SOA Development and Testing project will be deleted because it has not started and a defined project schedule has not been received. The original project cost and schedule was developed in July/August 2015 prior to a contractor being onboard. The contractor did not come on board until February 2016 and at that time we began developing a BCR to reflect the appropriate project cost and schedule.  However, this BCR was put on hold because we have had some issues with the contractor and a defined project schedule has never been provided.  Since the time the contractor started, we have issues with them meeting their deliverables.  The program area, government PM and COR have been in regular communication with the contractor to discuss their shortcomings and what the plan is to correct.  In March, we were informed that the final project plan was being delayed and we would not receive it until the end of April however our program area and PM were not confident that we would receive an acceptable plan on time.  At that time we discussed the situation with our program area as well as our PMGD contacts to determine how to properly report the information given the situation.  We have since been advised to delete the project that has not yet started and create an updated BCR once an appropriate project plan is confirmed.  At this point, while work does continue on the project, a large portion of the work is being done to try and get the contractor back on schedule and we have no accurate information to enter as an updated project cost and schedule.  Also, to date, the contractor has only been paid the up-front cost of the licenses and no other invoices have been paid. Once the new contractor provides an updated cost and defined project plan, another BCR will be submitted to implement the new plan.

2. This BCR will also remove the Self-Serve Functionality and Database Upgrades project as resources are currently needed to support other projects. This project will be reviewed during the FY17/BY18 annual project creation.  The decision to postpone this project was made by the program area in late March as there were other, high-profile projects (i.e. SOA) that needed additional attention.  Delaying this project will not cause any detrimental effects as it can be completed in the future if determine necessary. Due to an actual start date for this effort being erroneously entered, we are closing the project the next day with no cost as this project didn't start.",13361,"Projects, Activities",1999-2022,,,2016-07-22,17:39:46,25512

This decision was based on the initial solution (Artiva) not meeting the business needs of the project.  Once this solution was found not to meet the needs of the project, this project was put back into market research. This was needed into order to find another solution that could meet the business needs.  Oracle Advanced Collections was selected based on it performing nearly all of the requirements Accounts Receivable has for their debt collections process.  Not only was it a quicker process (shorter time frame to be completed), but it was also cost effective to stick with Oracle, and Oracle can meet nearly all of the requirements.

This BCR accounts for the additional alternative analysis into an Oracle E-Business Suite solution to meet the Accounts Receivable Branch functional needs.  Artiva solution was never chosen as an implementation solution, and was only one alternative as part of market research.  This BCR documents the continued market research of alternatives to meet functional needs surrounding an accounts receivable solution.

1.	At the 12-15-15 meeting of the TSS Management Steering Group (MSG) made the decision to revise the DME strategy.  Resources would be re-prioritized to emphasize our focus in increasing the efficiency of our Customer Service operations.  These changes included:

a)	Increasing the Open User Interfaces for TRES;
b)	Fully automating the IRS reporting function in TD;
c)	Expanding the number of self-servicing transactions for TD customers; and
d)	Reducing the need for redundant manual re-entry of data.

The RSS IPM and Program Sponsor concurred with this decision, which resulted in four projects being either re-scoped or canceled.

2.	When the FY16 DME schedule was prepared, TSS planned two 6-month projects to upgrade smaller operational support applications to a Windows 7 platform.  It became evident that all requirements would be met in one phase.  On 03-08-2016, the RSS IPM and the project sponsor agreed to cancel the second phase of a project.

3.	The IT service providers for RSS changed their cost allocation and reporting methods.  These changes were implemented after final cost estimates were gathered and submitted for the final FY16 baseline estimates.  These changes have compromised our ability to properly assess TSS performance in managing the RSS investment.  The RSS CPIC analyst recommended that the baseline should be adjusted to internalize these changes to address this issue.  The IPM and Program Sponsor approved this recommendation on 06-01-2016.

Primary Business Driver:  New and foundational changes have occurred in the Retail program since the original BY17 baseline estimates were submitted.  Specifically, the AC area of TSS will be split into two separate AC areas – Retail and Wholesale.  The split is driven largely by the need for separate executive focus on the both the Retail and Wholesale programs.

This enables the Bureau to determine if the Retail business line should take on a new mission and vision, which could, over time, lead to transformational change within the business.   The reorganization positions the Retail program to focus on implementing change.  In order to best achieve realization of this vision, Retail has re-assessed the plans for its IT assets.

The goal of this project was to build a public-facing and internet-based application to assist Retail customers to prepare requests for customer services more accurately (i.e. fill out forms correctly and submit the correct type of evidence).  Retail envisioned an inter-active application that would assist customers dynamically much in the same way that the commercial applications such as “Turbo-Tax,” does for completing income tax returns.


On 09-28-2017, the Retail Executive Committee (EOC) decided to cancel the Form-Tool development project, and defer it to a later fiscal year (date to be determined).  The rationale for this decision is as follows.

First, the technical assessment of the various options to implement this solution did not produce a desirable alternative.  An exploration of more wide-ranging alternatives was deemed necessary.

Second, resources for this project would be better used for other higher priority projects that directly support current mission critical functions.

Consequently, this project has been canceled for FY18.  This Pause BCR is being submitted to remove it from the investment’s baseline of planned DME projects.",15902,"Projects, Activities",2010-2030,,,2018-02-12,18:47:35,27971

A consultant was hired to evaluate the project in relation to the vision, and to review Retail’s technology debt. The consultant recommended that the project needed a simpler, more focused approach of servicing 1 product line (marketables) instead of the complexity of addressing differing multiple lines (to include savings bonds, which will be addressed later). The existing Core Framework (CF) built for TRIM serves as an ideal platform for the new project. On 3/3/17, the executive team decided to cancel TRIM and pursue MoCF, which would leverage CF. This decision enables Retail to achieve its goal of increasing accessibility to products, while simplifying the customer experience and improving operational efficiency. Request to approve MoCF did not start until June, and the project did not get full approval until Sept. The work to scope project requirements was ongoing into FY18. CPIC reporting deadlines for BY19 mandated that the schedule be reported in Aug. Without thoroughly scoping requirements, an ad hoc schedule was submitted to meet the deadline. Realizing that the schedule would not be sufficient, 2 risks (204748/204757) were added for this project. These risks have been realized, and are cited to justify pausing the project until a more accurate schedule can be prepared.

Retail uses SABRS to process payments and perform IRS reporting. This application will reach the end of its supportable life in FY19. Continued use of the application will expose Retail to intolerable security vulnerabilities. On 6/19/17, the executive team decided to replace the application with a more technologically current and viable application. In FY17, Retail planned to have this project approved within sufficient time to start work in Jan. In response to the potential risk of not being approved in time, 3 risks (204764/204766/209785) were added for this project. As the initiative is still undergoing governance review, Retail is citing these risks as justification to pause until full approval is obtained and a revised schedule is completed.

On 2/1/18, the executive team reevaluated FY18 project priorities and criteria for resource assignment in response to the ongoing constraints for DME resources. The deliverables from the CRV and APA projects were judged to be insufficiently critical to justify use of scarce resources, and the projects are cancelled for FY18.",15900,"Projects, Activities",2010-2030,,,2018-04-09,12:53:47,28126

In a typical year, Retail processes the redemption of over one million bonds worth more than $1 billion using SABRS.

The current SABRS is built on dated technology that will reach the end of its supportable life in July 2019.  The continued use of this application will jeopardize Retail's ability to both make timely and accurate payments to investors and ensure timely and accurate reporting of federal tax information, which are mission essential functions for the program.  The end of supportable life issue for the current application would introduce potential security vulnerabilities.

Consequently, Retail has obtained approval from the Investment Review Board (IRB) to initiate a project to develop and deploy a more technologically current and viable replacement for SABRS.  The IRB gave initial approval to explore the concept of building a replacement on 09-11-2017.  The FS Technical Architectural Review Board (TARB) approved the proposed design on 04-02-2018, and the IRB authorized the project to proceed on 05-07-2018.

Replacing the current technologically dated application is expect to yield savings in operations and maintenance cost.  Based on the current 5-year Period of Performance (PoP) Retail anticipates a net reduction of $0.955 million (the net reduction in O&M cost of $2.564 less the project's development cost $1.609 million).

The Retail program plays a curtail role in the management of federal finances.  The program brings in, on average, $40 to $50 billion of revenue annually through the sale of U.S. Treasury debt securities directly to the public.  Retail is also responsible for servicing over $185 billion of outstanding securities held by private individuals and organizations.  RSS provides the essential tools for the Retail program to accomplish its responsibilities in timely, accurate and cost effective manner.  Without the RSS investment, Retail could not effectively execute its duties, which would adversely impact the federal government’s ability to promptly service its outstanding debt.

 In June-2018, Retail's executive leadership working in conjunction with its IT service provider agreed to adopt a new project management (PM) strategy for the ongoing SABRS replacement project.  This new strategy would incorporate Agile-like practices to enable the Bureau to better transition to a full Agile environment.  Retail agreed with this recommendation for this project to better ensure that the project would be more effectively and efficiently managed.  The change in strategy, though, significantly changed the project's original baseline to such a degree that the original baseline ceased to be  an effective tool to monitoring the project's status.  Consequently, a new project baseline (#202050-202026) was introduced to better measure the project's status.   The replanning BCR for BY20 (Version #1414.1) was used to ensure that SPIKE would be updated in time for the FY19 changes, which was approved and submitted to OMB on 10-10-2018.

Due to the significance of changes to the scope, development of the FATCA FFI Registration release 1.0 officially ceased November, 2012. 

The purpose of this BCR is to reflect the change in scope based on agreements reached by the Governance bodies to deliver the legislated functionality.

FATCA FFI Registration Release 1.0 was originally intended to develop a web-based application that allows a Foreign Financial Institution (FFI) to apply for and become a Participating FFI (PFFI), with an agreement between the IRS and Foreign Financial Institutions.  The registration system would include a secure online document submission of the FFI registration form, agreement forms, deemed compliance forms as required (including electronic signature), periodic certifications and payment percentages for FFIs and their affiliates.

FATCA FFI Registration Release 1.1 will follow the IGA model agreements changing the registration requirements by requiring the Host Country Tax Authorities (HCTAs) to take on increased ""governance"" responsibilities; As a result, IRS registration will be redesigned to streamline the registration process with three primary steps: Account Creation, Registration Form and Agreement, and Approval.

This BCR establishes the FATCA FFI Registration Release 1.1 to deliver the agreed functionality in two Drops:
-- Drop 1 (early July): FFI Registration Release 1.1 Drop 1 will focus on high priority and externally visible requirements
-- Drop 2 (early October): will allow the IRS the ability to process FFI Registrations

5. Refund Processing with Fraud Detection (Fraud) processes requests for refunds of withholding payments.
6. Compliance will select cases and  conduct compliance activities. 
7. Withholding Payment Processing (WPP) will receive, process and track withholding payments.

The historical cost database is used as a basis for estimating costs of future projects. In reviewing costs for these projects, data entry errors for FATCA Release 4.0 and FATCA Release 3 FI Registration 2.0 were discovered. A correction BCR is being requested to address these errors. This BCR is requested to correct data entry errors for reported costs for FATCA Program Release 4.0 and FATCA Release 3.0 - FI Registration 2.0 which closed on 4/22/16, and 3/18/16.

As a result of refining the allocation process during a final reconciliation of the FY2016 activities cost errors were identified resulting in an overstatement of activity actuals for four activities, and an understatement for one activity. Processes are being implemented to assure accurate posting of costs: a second level review to validate reported governmental cost and monthly contractor reports; and additional reviews will supplement the existing process of monthly meetings with the primary Point of Contact (POC) and Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) in order to validate contract costs.

FATCA Program Release 4.0 Project:  Development Sprints (MS4B) activity: The actual cost for the activity should be revised from $1,152,592 to $1,037,698; resulting in a decrease of $114,894.  Integrated Testing (MS4B) activity: The actual cost for the activity should be revised from $965,152 to $934,985; resulting in a decrease of $30,167.

An additional BCR will be submitted for FY14 and beyond.  FY13 benchmarks the beginning of a major scope expansion in IPP with the implementation of the IGT capabilities. 

This baseline change request is needed for several reasons: 
- To adequately reflect costs associated with significant changes in scope driven by the Fiscal Service's business vision to:
o Enhance IPP intra-gov buy/sell functionality to support DoD in managing their intra-governmental buy/sell business processes more efficiently. 
o Continue accelerating and increasing the adoption of IPP within the Federal Government and externally with vendor organizations between 2013 -2015

The revised baseline reflects costs associated with: 
o Increase in funding for existing Operations and Maintenance milestones to support an increased number of agencies and vendors for electronic invoicing and the additional business line of intra-governmental buy/sell activity
- Develop and Implement market research and competitive intelligence strategy for IPP against other commercial e-invoicing solutions.
- Expansion of agency implementation and customer service support for Intra-governmental transactions. 
- Implementation of a customer relationship management system.
- Provide implementation planning assistance to agencies to expedite implementation.
- Expansion of vendor enrollment effort, including the rolling out of Payment Notification Service to vendors of non-IPP agencies.


o Addition of new DME milestones and resources to existing DME milestones to support the following expanded scope:
- Development of new application functionality and automated system interfaces to support exchange 

o Intra-governmental buy/sell transactions between IPP and systems at DOD service components:
- Development of new features for commercial vendor invoicing to enroll new agencies and vendors.
- Infrastructure changes driven by TWAI and Fiscal Service
- Conversion to the PAM standard format and addition of check and wire payment information to IPP.
- Enhancements to meet the standards for retention of electronic records as set forth by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Federal Records Act.
- Expansion of Web Focus reports and additional reporting metrics.

The following adjustments will be made:

1) Op Metric Adjustments:
--------------------------------

a) METRIC: Number of Vendor organizations enrolling in IPP (out of remaining 55,000) - ID 20046 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Current Reporting Frequency: Monthly
 - Updated Reporting Frequency: Annually

- Current Target: 4.00 (4,000 per month)
- Updated Target: 20.00 (20,000 per year).  

The new Target is based upon FRB's FY14 projection of 20,000 Vendors to be added in total.  Vendor enrollment fluctuates from month-to-month, making annual reporting more appropriate as opposed to monthly reporting.  



b) METRIC:  Number of Agencies Enrolling in IPP (out of remaining 150) - ID 20043
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Current Reporting Frequency: Annually
- Updated Reporting Frequency: Quarterly 

- Current Target: 8.00 (8,000 per year)
- Updated Target: 2.00 (2,000 per QTR)

The Reporting Frequency must be adjusted for this Op Metric in order to abide by the Department's/OMB's criteria for investment Op Metrics. 


2) New Op Metric:
--------------------------------
METRIC:  Number of Invoices processed in IPP

We are also adding the ACA Release 6.1 project to the E300B Project Level, and active FY 2014 Milestones to the Activity Level for the E300B.  
  
At the Activity level, which are the ACA Milestones, current Estimation Program Office's Basis of Estimate (BOE) cost data for each milestone has been replaced with FY 2014 Spend Plan non-labor and labor cost data.  Additionally, FY 2015 cost data was collected and was utilized for activities underway in FY 2014 but scheduled to close in FY 2015.  

At the Project Level, which are the ACA Releases, we replaced current BOE cost data with FY 2010 - FY 2014 Spend Plan data and additional cost data collected to close out Releases in FY 2015.  This will allow us to treat 300B Project and Activity costs in the same manner, since the same primary source is used for both sections of the 300B, with the exception of Release 6.1.  To accomplish this, we assigned non-labor and labor costs for FY 2010, FY 2011, FY 2012, and FY 2013 to each active release, based upon the BOE approach to assigning release costs.  For Release 6.1, which closes in March of 2016, we used the latest BOE estimate for the Project cost.  This is the most complete estimate of Release 6.1.

Baseline Change Request Overview:  CPIC reporting for DATA Act projects was set up with the requirements/schedule as we knew them to be at that time the projects were entered into CPIC.  OMB was expected to provide approval of the final reporting architecture late December, early January, but OMB did not provide a final approval of the reporting architecture until early March.  The final reporting architecture that was agreed upon between Treasury and OMB altered the scope of the work. The original schedule was based on a time-line in accordance with the architecture that didn't include ingestion of data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).   The teams were working for two months in one direction and are now having to shift to a different direction which pushed some time lines out.  The delay in reaching an agreement between Treasury and OMB as well as the change in scope has cascaded to all Agile iterations including the Schema, Data Broker and Data Store.  In order to meet the May deployment date we will have to remove the release of the Alpha 2 Data Broker activity due to this change in scope.  This shift caused the teams to work longer than originally expected on the projects and in turn resulted in an increase in costs as well as changes in timeline/schedules for some projects/activities.",13676,"Projects, Activities",2014-2099,,,2016-05-19,14:09:41,25313

1.Increase the costs and schedule of CARS Project: SAM WebFocus and WebLogic POAM Items.
The initial baseline cost and schedule was submitted to PMGD before the completion of the define sessions which established the project scope.  After the completion of the define sessions, armed with a full understanding of the scope of the project and the level of effort needed to implement the scope, it was realized that the initial submission was underestimated.  This decision was made by the Program area management (Director/Managers), the CARS project team (Kearney & Company, P.C.) and FRB St. Louis.
2.Update and increase cost and schedule for two GTAS Projects:  
GTAS Enhance Reporting, Security & Access Control - GTAS planned completion dates and planned/actual costs updated to reflect the result of FY16 OMB Passback (issued in FY15).  During this process, OMB created additional requirements for GTAS that have now been incorporated in this release. These additional requirements were discussed program area management (Director/Managers, with the support of the AC/DAC) and FRB St. Louis in the 1st Quarter of FY16 to determine this release.
GTAS Enhance IGT Module and Year-End Reporting – The planned completion date was updated to reflect additional capability needed to incorporate GFRS functionality into GTAS.  This update in schedule was decided upon by program area management (Sarah Mehelic, with the support of the AC/DAC) and the projected completion date for the Activity as a whole is unaffected.
3.IPAC Project: IPAC Release 18.0-IGT Enhancements at IPP Spring Batch – Cost and schedule reduced and/or eliminated.
Fiscal Service leadership directed our focus to moving IPP-IGT from Payments Management to Fiscal Accounting and standing up a new instance on the TWAI to support IG transactions. Following this direction, program area management (Matt Conrad, with the support of the AC/DAC) decided in December 2015 that the only update that will be made in FY16 is modifying the URL to reflect the new location of G-Invoicing. 
4.IPAC Project: G-Invoicing – Cost and schedule reduced.
IPAC Release 18.0-IGT Enhancements at IPP Spring Batch, there are several high priority enhancements that need to be made to the G-Invoicing application in order to accommodate a government-wide roll out.

As of January 31, 2017, the decision was made by the Fiscal Accounting AC to reevaluate the current GTAS/GFRS consolidation (Activities 2 and 3) to examine alternative methods to eliminate a major audit weakness. The decision was also made by the AC, in accordance with recommendations from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), that for the remainder of FY17 a security focused release will be developed and deployed to address various POAMs that expire this year and cannot be risk accepted going forward. This release will include the refactoring of three areas of the current GTAS code, which will also fix certain non-security priority defects currently present in the application. Due to these decisions, the detailed project work forecasted in the original FY 17 BCR for GTAS has changed.

- the necessity to eliminate a group of significant security issues,
- potential agency issues with deploying the OMB release so close to fiscal year end, and
- the desire of senior Fiscal Accounting management to reevaluate the current approach being taken to consolidate GFRS functionality into GTAS.

In BCR 1107.1, which was submitted to OMB in March 2017:
Release 2.9 (work was scheduled and partially completed), which included OMB requested enhancements and business area functionality improvements, was paused and will be finished and deployed during FY18
Release 3.0, which was scoped to continue the consolidation effort to incorporate GFRS functionality into the GTAS application, was paused while Fiscal Service examines alternative methods to achieve the goal of eliminating a major audit weakness.
Release 3.1, which has not been scoped, was paused pending the review of the GTAS/GFRS consolidation activity.

This BCR will revise the scope and schedule for GTAS for the remainder of FY17. During the period from 2/17 to 8/17, a security focused release will be developed and deployed to address various POAMs that expire this year and cannot be risk accepted going forward.

1) In late FY16/early FY17, two independent reviews were conducted on the PPS project, resulting in several improvement recommendations related to (1) program/project management, and (2) code development/testing approaches. On December 12, 2016, the PPS Executive Steering Committee (ESC) met to reassess the PPS project based on the independent review recommendations. The ESC decided to revise R3.0's schedule to accommodate additional security policy and moratorium requirements. During FY16, PPS 3.0 was impacted and delayed by a change in scope to deliver an authorization engine to authorize roles for application users. The original baseline was developed on the assumption that an enterprise solution would be in place for this functionality; however, during R3.0, it was determined that the solution would not be available and Executive approval was given to proceed with a custom solution. Additional delays were also experienced due to a new security policy requirement impacting the length of time it took to complete the Authority To Operate (ATO) action, and a moratorium to stop work on the hosting platform that supports IRS during the tax season. This BCR will add additional R3.0 activities to complete testing and deployment.

2) The ESC also decided to rebaseline the FY17 R3.1, 4.0, and 5.0 activities. The new baseline for R3.1, 4.0, and 5.0 is under development and expected to be approved at the PPS ESC and Bureau Investment Review Board in April 2017.

Because the TCMS side of the TCMS/DVS investment was in steady state, we were not previously planning a TCMS release before this directive was issued.

CIR ABA Data - This requirement stems from the Shared Accounting Module's (SAM) decision to no longer provide ABA (same as routing transit number (RTN) data) to partner Treasury investments after CY 2016.  The Collections Information Repository (CIR) requires updated ABA data, so an alternate source of this ABA data is required.  The CIR ABA Data utility is an extension of code that was already developed by the Debit Gateway to obtain ABA data updates from the FRB's Global Customer Directory (GCD).  Unfortunately, due to CIR's recent code freeze and development backlog, this utility could not be integrated into the CIR's development schedule in time for SAM's deadline of providing this information.  As a result, the utility is being placed into this TCMS release.  TCMS will deliver the ABA data to the File Transfer Gateway, which will allow CIR to obtain the data file.  This was a late addition to this TCMS release.  It was first discussed on 6/16/2016 and approved through Fiscal Service Investment Review Board for inclusion into 2.2.1 on 7/13/2016.

FRB Contact Updates - This effort came about as a result of the Fiscal Agent Consolidation (FAC) decision to move TCMS from FRB Boston to FRB Cleveland.  The TCMS application contained information for user support that needed to be updated as a result of the switch in FRBs.  The FAC decision was issued in the fall of 2014 and recognition that this change was required came sometime in late 2015/2016.  This change, by itself, was not big enough to warrant its own release.  TCMS's user base is confined to FRB users from the servicing district, so the impact of incorrect contact information would not be detrimental to users.  The requirement for legacy FMS references facilitated the correction of this contact information.

As a result, in May 2015 the agency stopped production on the existing the DCPS code base. With the collaboration of DDS end-users, Chief Technology Office (CTO), and United States Digital Service (USDS), SSA refocused efforts to develop and implement a secure, end-to-end Core Product capable of handling all case types by the end of calendar year 2016. Once the Core Product is released, development teams will continue to improve software through iterations, delivering additional business value in an Agile fashion throughout the life of the product. 
While the objective and overall scope of the project remain unchanged, there are several key differences in how we will pursue this path forward, with the ultimate goal of accelerating the delivery of DCPS and reducing future costs. The new approach departs from the prior waterfall methodology in favor of the development and delivery of software through shorter and more user-responsive iterations (Agile sprints). The focus is on creating a simplified core of common components on a modern, cloud-based foundation using a state of the art programming language. 
The iterative approach includes several modern techniques that will reduce the time it takes to develop and deploy the final software product. One example is the use of DevOps - a software development method that integrates the development phase traditionally performed by software developers with the operational phase that has always been performed by IT service management in the past. These changes will have significant impact to our planning, and require modification of the existing project timeline. Previously project completion was forecast for 2023, but under the new iterative approach we do not expect for primary production to extend beyond 2019 - as such we are modifying the project schedule to reflect completion in 2019. We will update this schedule as required in future updates.",13090,"Projects, Activities",2008-2019,,,2015-09-17,18:27:37,23751

The cost of the DMA PureScale Feasibility study is being reduced and funds are being reallocated to other IT Modernization Disability activities.

Benefits:
For tracking and reporting accuracy, funds will be transferred to cover a contractor that was moved. After careful review of the budget to date, additional funds can be transferred to another project to offset costs associated with the support they have provided to the project. Additionally, reducing funds for the project in FY18 due to changes in scope. This funding change request is for tracking and reporting accuracy.

The additional resources shifted to Person Information to deliver enhancement in support of other domains. Additional funding will also be used to cover communication notices in future years. This redistribution of funding amongst project activities was done to better reflect planned cost.

As a result of the feasibility study with Platform Transition, the CIO decided not to continue the content manager. Therefore, funding was decreased for the Platform Transition, Agency Cloud Initiative and Back Office Modernization projects.

Additional delay was due to placing a higher priority on Milestones Module Development, as this is the oldest module and contains the most out of date business rules. Requirements will be gathered in tandem with the Milestones Development.  Requirements will be finalized and approved by all stakeholders and development will commence upon release of the  Milestones Module Redesign Development.  

The start date for the General Information Module Development activity experienced a delay due to budgetary constraints applied during the recent Project Review in which IPABS was directed to proceed with a minimum budget, supporting only current Operations and Maintenance activities and essential upgrades.  Additionally, the annual IG audit has created a temporary draw on limited project resources. The General Information Module Development activity will be removed and rescheduled at a later time when dates and costs can be better estimated.

The start date for the Milestones Module Redesign Development activity experienced a delay due to budgetary constraints applied during the recent Project Review in which IPABS was directed to proceed with a minimum budget, supporting only current Operations and Maintenance activities and essential upgrades.  Additionally, there was a delay in meeting with the data owner to finalize requirements and ensure that major rework was not required after current requirements were developed against, without stakeholder buy in. Approval will be requested to meet with the data owner to finalize requirements and answer questions on existing requirements that will impact the level of effort and design of the module.  The IPABS team estimates a completion date of 09/30/2016.  These dates will include, development, internal quality assurance testing, and external User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

April 1, 2016 was selected to correspond with the second half of FY2016 and provide time to vet the Project/Activity budgets and ensure cost control reporting is in place.  

The re-baseline will facilitate DOE-SRs ability to provide meaningful oversight of the Contractor Enterprise System by providing visibility into significantly more IT costs.  For example, the current FY2016 Projects are budgeted at $1,350K, whereas the proposed re-baselined Projects aggregate to $3,167K for the period April 1 through September 30, 2016, only.  For FY2017, the re-baselined Projects are budgeted at approximately $6,400K.  Further, the re-baseline aligns Project(s) and Activities with the site WBS structure, resulting in positive control of costs against control account budgets and alignment with the way work is managed by the Contractor.  This should significantly reduce the historical reporting of non-meaningful variances that were caused from tracking costs against smaller bins of level of effort work, such as security patches and functionality patches.

The PeopleSoft Portion of CB/FAS (M&O Contractor, SRNS scope) will have one (1) Project:
  Enterprise Systems Maintenance and Support

This project will have four (4) activities in FY2016 (April 1, 2016   September 30, 2016) and eight activities for out years, each covering a six (6) month period for:
  Finance System Maintenance and Support
  Project Controls System Maintenance and Support
  Human Resource Management System Maintenance and Support
  Supply Chain Management System Maintenance and Support

Additional projects and activities may be added for DME projects (outside of maintenance and support), such as the upcoming PeopleSoft 9.2 upgrade.

During the development of BY2013 E300 Process, CDX set a Planned Budget which was reviewed and approved by OEI IMO and EPA CPIC Offices and submitted to OMB. However, due to agency budget changes, the available budget for CDX BY2013 activities was reduced drastically from the Planned Budget. Continuing Resolutions delayed the release of the final Enacted Budget numbers preventing CDX from revising the Exhibit 300 during the available resubmission windows. This has resulted in CDX reporting monthly against the higher Planned Budget amounts. CDX requests initiation of re-baseline in order to align Planned costs for Project Activities with the revised Enacted budget. CDX will complete this re-baseline by updating the Project Activities Table in eCPIC with revised estimates for Planned and Projected Costs. Current Planned Costs, which were derived from the Planned Budget, will be downwardly revised proportional to the reduction in available funds issued in the Enacted Budget.

The new baseline is needed to correct a life cycle cost error and adjust milestones due to a change in scope. O&M costs were understated for FY2014 through FY2017 by $20.1M. The EPA major system, Superfund Document Management System (SDMS), is being integrated into SEMS a year sooner than originally planned. The change impacts project cost and schedule, resulting in an earned value variance greater than five percent. Through the rebaselining, SEMS will realign milestones to better represent enhanced requirements definition for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) integration portion of the effort. This will result in a more streamlined development process. Funding adjustments correlate to the changes of schedule as the overall project costs are estimated in more detail. 

The rebaseline reflects a significant alteration to the scope of the SEMS project by accelerating the schedule to integrate a major subsystem, the SDMS into the SEMS a year sooner than originally planned, from FY2011 to FY2010. Project costs will show an increase for the reasons stated in the change rationale. Systems operation and maintenance costs were calculated inaccurately for FY2014   2017 in the previous business case submission and have been updated. The rebaseline will not affect the final planned delivery date of SEMS. There are realignments to the project milestones which will better integrate project scope. The SEMS schedule is changing in two ways. First, the integration of the SDMS major system is being advanced by one year to occur completely within 2010. Second, SDMS milestones are being combined into the Operations and Maintenance milestone of SEMS. Even though portions of the schedule are being advanced, the overall development portion of the project holds to the same completion date in 2013. Realignments of milestone dates and funding will permit a smoother transition forward on a project that is accelerating key subsystem integrations.",,,,58.943973,2017-09-30,2011-03-09,11:40:42,3751

The reason for the variance in the actual start date for R.1 (Incorporation of agency feedback into Initial Alfresco in production) was due to the fact that its predecessor activity (P.5, Alfresco pilot w/agencies) took a little bit longer than anticipated.  The Alfresco pilot had to be complete so that we could have all of that feedback available to put into our initial Alfresco in production.

The reason for the variance in the actual start date for R.3 (Postgres Migration, otherwise known as a private repository) is that its predecessor activity (P.6, Repository Part II, also known as the Public Repository) also took a little longer than anticipated.  The Public Repository needed to be completed before we could get the Private Repository effort underway.

The changes reflected in the project and activities table do not constitute a rebaseline as defined by FAA's baseline management policy.  The program received approval for an extensive replan due to 1) GEO WAAS satellite failure in FY10; 2) regaining control of GEO satellite; 3) return of service in March 2011; 4) underestimation of the scope of work of software development of the G-III reference receiver.  The schedule replan is required to ensure the continuity of current services to WAAS users in concert with the implementation of planned enhancements.  Changes to planned activity completion dates for Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) milestones have been made consistent with the Baseline Management Notice (BMN) briefed to the FAA's Joint Resources Council (JRC) in April 2012.  The updated APB has been signed by Air Traffic's Vice President of Program Management.

A data entry error was found in the first re- baseline (reflects OCFO's decision to delay implementation from 10/17/14 to 04/23/15) that FHWA performed.  The data error was a result of the manual process that is required to do the cost build-ups prior to entering the data into the tool.

The increase in cost associated with this re-baseline action is $1.1 M, which was reported in the June Submission. The $.685M increase for the July ITDB submission reflects the delta from previously Reported Costs vs. Actual Costs for the Planning, Design, Development, Testing, & Implementation activities.

ADIS updated the interface with APIS Manifest to pull manifest data directly once the person is at Primary Inspection (in front of the officer).  This upgrade reduced the multiple APIS Manifest updates on each traveler by 1/3 without missing any data.  Before updating the interface, APIS Manifest would send approximately 3 to 10 matching updates on each person from 3 days before the arrival to when the person actually arrives in country.

Cargo Release (M2.3/Milestone #35) is the next release of ACE development, and is expected to begin development by FY12 commensurate with the budget and approval from the ARB. The program office will develop the documentation required for ADE-2a to receive approval from the ARB to begin development. Until the documentation and LCCE can be developed for Cargo Release, ACE is unable to provide a further breakdown of the milestone. Air Manifest (#37) is expected to be the next piece of development after Cargo Release; however the program will again return to the ARB to seek approval for development.

- Updated the Projects and Project Activities Planned/Projected Dates and Costs for Project ID 5 (Release 5).

The USCIS Transformation program is moving ELIS to a simpler and more flexible architecture therefore resulting in complexity of maintaining the system in one architecture and re-building it in another.   This provides challenges in program acquisition planning and execution.  The program has effectively moved to an agile development methodology; however, schedule slippages have occurred with Release 5, breaching the acquisition program baseline's initial operational capability milestones.  This occurred due to dependencies on DHS' ability to stand up cloud environments and USCIS underestimating the complexities implementing continuous integration and builds within the development process.  Both DHS and USCIS are working on the infrastructure for the cloud environment as well as interface configuration between the development and production environments.   USCIS was able to recently award a contract for managing the continuous integration and configuration management needed for development.  The award was significantly delayed due to a vendor protest.
 
Using the agile approach for development, USCIS focuses on the capability that will allow internal users to effectively manage the workload and external users to effectively submit their applications.  USCIS is improving its ability to track capability delivered to its operational requirements document.",,,2006-2032,,,2014-03-14,13:24:28,17067

However, USCIS will not be releasing a new immigration benefit type until late FY 2014 because the Program is currently transitioning the existing architecture for USCIS' Electronic Immigration System (USCIS ELIS) system to a simpler and more flexible architecture.  During this transition, DHS and USCIS are working to address some critical engineering issues related to the technical environments necessary to develop and produce required system interfaces and new functionality related to specific immigration benefit types.  These critical engineering issues have impacted the program schedule.  The Program will be returning for an Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) 2B re-baseline prior to the 4th Quarter of FY 2014.

Last month, the Program improperly added a start and end date of 11/14 (the original planned start date) to the above activities to reflect the cancellation.

Deployment of Federal Financial Services Platform (FFSP) - Infrastructure GEN2 activities have been deleted as these functions will be transferred to HUD OCIO as part of the existing HITS infrastructure contract.



An additional project activity has been added for the Physical Inspections Alignment initiative while consolidating phases of the original alignment project.

The protest was resolved in November 2012 and a new award was made. At that time the Investment Manager learned for the first time the details of the new contract ceiling, which is now controlled annually at the system level instead of the portfolio level. In many cases this ceiling structure conflicted with and would not support the planned cost of projects in this Investment. Therefore resources and scope for the projects had to be realigned within the portfolio in order to work within these constraints. 

Additional rationale for re-baseline varies by Project:

Energy and Performance Information Center (EPIC) Spring 2013 Release 3, eGrants-eSnaps System Release #2: Scope and Objective evolve due to iterative system development. This project has been re-planned under a managed change control process. 

Hearth-eGrants-GMP System Release #1 and Hearth-eGrants-IDIS System Release #2: Adding detail within overall Cost and Schedule goals. These projects may now be decomposed to a finer level of detail to show milestones or Usable Functionalities, along with associated Costs and Schedule. 

Hearth-eGrants-eSnaps System Release #1: Modifying detail within overall Cost and Schedule goals. During the course of iterative software development, two Usable Functionalities were removed from scope under managed change control process, and the plan updated / project re-baselined. Specifically, these two functionalities could not be completed due to pending OMB approval of HEARTH Competitive Homeless assistance grant regulations. These factors are outside of HUD s control. 



Hearth-eGrants-GMP System Release #2, Hearth-eGrants-IDIS System Release #3, and Hearth-eGrants-eSnaps System Release #3: Scope and Cost evolve due to iterative system development, and due to Significant Contract change (see contract ceiling discussion above). Specifically, HUD must decrease planned scope and budgets on these three projects and redistribute resources within the portfolio to accommodate the funding limits defined by the contract ceilings for each of these three systems.",,,2011-2020,,,2013-03-29,15:35:43,12919

OPM used a separate Earned Value Management (EVM) tool and process to closely manage investments that spend money in development of new functionality.  

The FY2011 Continuing Resolution has impacted EHRI customer agencies' ability to fund new eOPF implementations under EHRI's fee-for-service funding model. As a result, several agencies that were planned for FY2011 have not moved forward and have to be removed from EHRI's baseline.  These agencies include the Department of Defense, Department of Interior, and the Department of the Treasury.

Also, under review is EHRI's funding for the Data Warehouse (DW). Historically, the steady state milestone covering DW hosting, operations and maintenance was aligned with EHRI's appropriation. This re-baseline event, however, brings the DW hosting, operations and maintenance milestone in line with the program's EVM baseline.

The impact of Agencies not implementing eOPF in FY11 is decreased planned costs in the following milestones:

Fee-for-Service - FY2011 Hosting, Operations and Maintenance
Fee-for-Service - FY2011 eOPF Implementation -  DoD (partial), Treasury (partial)
Fee-for-Service - FY2011 ePower Licenses

The planned cost for the Data Warehouse Production Operations and Maintenance FY2011 milestone is now aligned with EHRI's EVM baseline. There is no impact to EHRI's budget.

This rebaseline is a correction to the previous 3/1/2011 rebaseline that was to change the funding strategy.                                     

                The purpose of this BCR is twofold. First, it brings EHRI's Information Technology (IT) Dashboard milestones in line with its existing Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 earned value management (EVM) baseline. Second, it revises EHRI's FYI2 milestones to be consistent with the Program's Budget Year 2012 appropriated funding passback from the Office of Management & Budget (OMB). These changes do not reflect problems with the investment.

                                             The overall impact of this change is to add the initial baseline to the Dashboard and to make reductions to the EHRI spending because EHRI has not received funding from the partner agencies for the associated eOPF implementations, there have been no commitments made by EHRI to any partner agency or contractor. If the partner agencies are unable to secure funding for the eOPF project in the next several months, it will present challenges to both EHRI and partner agencies in meeting stated OPM and OMB performance goals. Additionally, delays in funding may force EHRI scanning vendors to close their facilities and lay off their employees.
