ADS-B is an environmentally friendly technology that enhances safety and efficiency, and directly benefits pilots, controllers, airports, airlines and the public. ADS-B supports the FAA mission and goals to increase economic competitiveness and safety, influencing the performance metrics for Average Daily Airport Capacity and National Airspace System (NAS). ADS-B supports the FAA mission and goals to increase economic competitiveness and safety, influencing the performance metrics for Average Daily Airport Capacity and National Airspace System (NAS) On-Time Arrivals. This investment provides operational, user and government benefits, and directly contributes to the FAA mission of reducing congestion and providing increased capacity in the NAS. ADS-B also facilitates the transition to the NextGen. ADS-B is the cornerstone technology for NextGen and promises to significantly increase efficiency and enhance safety by broadcasting aircraft position based on precise signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System – effectively tracking and managing air traffic. This information will be used for surveillance applications and Air Traffic Services Displays on automation systems such as En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM), Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS), Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), HOST, and Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP).  Nearby aircraft equipped with ADS-B In avionics may receive and process surveillance information for display to the pilot using the aircraft's multifunction display. Pilots use the display to enhance situational awareness of the surrounding airspace. ADS-B equipment may also be placed on ground vehicles to allow controllers and pilots to locate and identify them when they are on runways or taxiways. The segment of the SBS program baselined in May 2012 provided funding for three goals - continued provision of baseline services and applications to achieve a wide array of efficiency, safety and cost savings benefits; expanded surveillance coverage in the Gulf of Mexico further increasing capacity resulting in reduced delays; and implementation of the fuel saving ADS-B In-Trail Procedure (ITP) in oceanic airspace.","021APG18090 - Reduce Aviation-Related Fatalities, 021APG18095 - Improve Conditions of America's Transportation Related Infrastructure, 021SO18098 - System Operations and Performance","ADS-B is a technology that will allow implementation of new air traffic control procedures based on more accurate aircraft position information that will allow better use of existing airspace.  This should result in an increase in capacity and will result in fewer delays and more optimal routing for aircraft.  The efficiency benefits include reductions in weather deviations, reduced cancellations resulting from increased access to some Alaskan villages during reduced weather conditions, additional controller automation, and additional aircraft to aircraft applications.  The efficiency benefits translate to savings in both aircraft direct operating costs and passenger value of time.  The Business Case Analysis Report dated May 15, 2012 shows $3.2B in capacity and efficiency benefits.
 
Given the significant funds already invested in SBS, the incremental costs are outweighed by the benefits with a B/C ratio of 1.2.  Each of the new scope areas, expansion of coverage in the Gulf of Mexico and the ADS-B in ITP application, have a positive return on investment with B/C ratios of 3.8 and 1.3 respectively.  
 
The total baseline program when considering sunk costs and benefits approaches break-even with a B/C ratio of 0.9.  This is consistent with the strategy to deploy an infrastructure that can be leveraged for future operational improvements.  The SBS program is pursuing additional applications which have the potential to significantly improve the overall business case increasing the B/C ratio to the range of 1.1 to 1.2 and resulting in a positive net present value of approximately $1.0B or more.  A subsequent investment decision and business case analysis update will solidify the set of additional investments that can build on the program baseline.",N/A,no,no,no,http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NextGenUpdate2014.pdf|https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/general_aviation/adsb/|https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/equipadsb/media/NextGenForGA.pdf,,"David Gray","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,2006,2025,"The 2018 total cost in the Prior Year President's Budget was 156.86M, while current year (FY2019) total cost is 155.86M.

Phoenix is a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) financial management system that replaced the New Management System (NMS) legacy financial management system. Phoenix is USAID's single, worldwide accounting system, operational in headquarters and in missions overseas. It is a federally compliant and secure financial management system that allows Agency staff to analyze, manage and report on foreign assistance funds. Phoenix is USAID's accounting system of record and the basis for the Agency's financial statements and reporting. As the cornerstone of USAID's financial operation, Phoenix aligns with other Agency initiatives; the system is currently interfaced with several USAID and US Government IT solutions, and supports emerging needs presented by changes to USAID's IT portfolio. USAID staff, regardless of location, requires reliable and accessible tools that provide on-demand access to knowledge and information. A large portfolio of financial reports is available to help USAID staff access and interpret financial information. Users can access reports through four different tools: the Phoenix system itself via ""Phoenix Application"" reports, Business Objects Enterprise (BOE), PhoenixViewer, or PhoenixViewer Exec-Info. Many of these tools have undergone both routine and innovative changes. The Phoenix software system will be upgraded in July 2016 from Momentum version 7.0.2 to version 7.2.1 to allow the Agency to comply with Federal financial management requirements and use of government-wide solutions, including the ability to leverage the Invoice Processing Platform in FY 167/18 depending on funding, as well as aligning with Agency hardware and software standards such as Ping Federate's ""Single Sign On (SSO)"" solution.","014APG18030 - IT Modernization","The Phoenix system and related financial reports are used primarily by financial management staff at USAID. Operational effectiveness of the financial system and reports reduce the amount of time these employees need to spend manually accounting for USAID money, and allows them to shift their focus toward more value-add activities. Ex: The upgrade to 7.2.1 in 2016 will include the following key benefits to the Agency and system users: Global Dynamic Extensibility   allows for custom changes to the user interface by setting extensibility at the document type level, and on reference data tables, queries, and the Inbox. Dynamic Extensibility can tailor the user interface by hiding, moving, setting field lengths and renaming fields as well as marking fields as required or setting default values. This tool can cater to USAID's preference by simplifying pages and hiding unused fields as well as renaming fields. Budget Module   includes improvements to budget data entry introducing a single page allowing all nodes to be viewed in a single location as opposed to separate multiple tabs when performing a budget transaction. Invoicing Processing Platform (IPP)   provides the ability to transmit vendor, award/order and payment status data to IPP, as well as record receipt of invoices and credit memos from IPP into Momentum. Invoice to Pay (I2P)   Matches data from the referenced document to the invoice which will populate header-level values (such as vendor information) reducing the amount of manual data entry required and decreasing the likelihood of user error. *Note: Implementing IPP and I2P outlined above will be managed as separate from the overall scope of the 7.2.1 upgrade, as the projects are dependent on funding in FY17 and 18. Sound financial data and useful reports also benefit USAID staff at all levels. They rely on this information to make programmatic decisions. Most of USAID's ""on the ground"" foreign assistance work is done by funding implementing partners, financial management is essential to the foreign assistance program cycle. USAID is aiming to attain greater process efficiency by promoting innovation through collaboration and process transparency. Phoenix support to Agency staff is now provided leveraging USAID's collaboration platforms. In addition, financial management and transparent reporting benefits stakeholders outside of the Agency who have an interest in knowing how foreign assistance funds are allocated.","Enables USAID to be compliant with new federal regulations and requirements, such as the Treasury's Do Not Pay portal, NIST 800-53 rev 4 controls, as well as a limited number of similar mandates in FY 2015 and FY 2016. This version of the software establishes a foundation to address new federal requirements, including the Component Treasury Symbol enhancement, and the Payment Information Repository (PIR) 1166 file updates. These changes were not addressed in the Phoenix 7.0.2 version. The 7.2.1 upgrade also helps USAID align with OMB guidance, specifically OMB Circular A-123 Appendix D, which directs Federal agencies to deploy frequent enhancements to software solutions, and use non-customized commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions. Oracle 12c, included in the upgrade, better supports virtualized and cloud infrastructures, enabling the agency to move away from using physical servers. 

The upgraded software provides immediate user benefits, including simplified data entry and the improved ability to review Credit Card Reconciliation and Budget data. The enhancements help financial management staff in Mission and Washington perform their work more efficiently and effectively. The 7.2.1 upgrade has provided users technical benefits, such as the ability to implement Ping Federate's Single Sign-On (SSO) solution, which also aligns with agency's IT Strategic Plan objective of more Effective and Efficient IT services.

AHLTA provides secure, 24x7, worldwide online access to patients´ medical records, making it a key enabler of military medical readiness. AHLTA stores data in a central location to ensure healthcare providers have ready access to medical information when and where needed to support the military's highly mobile patient population. 

Goal: As military members move from location to location, AHLTA is readily available to support their healthcare needs. AHLTA supports uniform, high-quality health promotion and healthcare delivery to Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries across the military enterprise.  Leveraging existing EHR legacy systems within DoD and Veterans Affairs (VA) – AHLTA and Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) – the Departments share a significant amount of health information today through computable data exchange mechanisms.  

Benefit: AHLTA provides DoD healthcare providers with ready access to medical information when and where needed to support the military’s highly mobile patient population. Since the worldwide implementation of AHLTA in 2006, use of the system has grown at a significant pace. AHLTA processes an average of 155,000 encounters each workday and over 432 million outpatient encounters are stored in its clinical data repository (CDR).  Patient encounter records are retrievable at nearly 450 fixed and deployed treatment facilities worldwide. The enterprise serves over 9.4 million service members, retirees and beneficiaries.

AHLTA is a legacy system that will be replaced by the MHS GENESIS new electronic health record managed by DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program.

The customers for this project include the beneficiaries, health care providers, and managers of the Army, Navy and Air Force Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Primary end-users are Military Health System (MHS) patients for whom quality care is the utmost priority.  The stakeholders for AHLTA include the medical providers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, the Joint Staff along with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) staff.

The EOSDIS processes, ingests, archives, and distributes Earth science data from NASA Earth science missions and other sources as directed by NASA HQ Earth Science Division.  EOSDIS supports the full lifecycle processes of NASA mission data. This includes creating data and periodically reprocessing due to changes in instrument characteristics and improvements to scientific algorithms. EOSDIS provides discipline-unique tools, visualization tools, metadata and search capabilities and data subsetting and subsampling capabilities built around the needs of specific science disciplines. These science disciplines include land cover analysis, cryosphere, atmosphere composition and pollution, ecosystems, physical oceanography, space-based geodesy and socio-economic change as documented by earth observations from space, aircraft and in-situ measurements.  The architecture of EOSDIS is geographically distributed in the US.  It includes systems at other NASA Centers, other US Agencies and academia.

The majority of EOSDIS software is custom developed, utilizing unique algorithms to accommodate the different instrumentation and science disciplines. The unique nature of the scientific applications as well as the high-speed processing and distribution capabilities needed to manage the processes involved in automatically generating the scientific products ensures that they can be instantaneously searched and accessed in order to distribute them to a broad, multidisciplinary user community on a daily basis. EOSDIS' expected accomplishments in FY18, FY19 and FY20 are to continue to collect data from current missions, process all data at high-speed rates, reprocess science data as required and distribute science data products to the public, research and applications users.

EOSDIS is in its operational phase supporting all EOS missions. At the end of FY 17, EOSDIS archives held 23.8 petabytes of data, growing at 15.3 terabytes per day and supporting distribution to users at nearly 53.1 terabytes/day. EOSDIS distributed over 1,393.7 million products (data files) to users in FY17. Fiscal year data is gathered annually and will be available at the end of the calendar year.","026SO18153 - Understand the Sun, Earth, Solar System, and Universe.","EOSDIS provides a healthy Return on Investment as demonstrated by the yearly increases in access to its data holdings and the use of those data in research. This increase in access and use occurs while the overall system budget experiences modest increases. Distribution has been increasing much faster than the project budget increases driving the cost to NASA per product distributed to public users down to $0.12 as presented in the most recent PPBE review. The budget changes are largely the result of additional functionality or responsibilities assigned to the system rather than increased cost of regular operations. For example EOSDIS added a Near Real-Time (NRT) capability, improved access to imagery, and developed a common platform for an improved web presence. The NRT capability called Land Atmospheres Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) leverages EOSDIS  distributed science processing to generate and distribute global near real-time products, creating data products within 3 hours from observation to support users such as natural resource managers, hazards and disasters workers, and scientists/researchers. EOSDIS provides Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), a full resolution image capability for visualizing data from EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive Centers. EOSDIS developed a common platform for an improved web presence (see http://earthdata.nasa.gov). This website supports EOSDIS-wide collaboration by creating a central website connecting all aspects of EOSDIS and providing a platform for incorporating new capabilities. These new capabilities provide additional services to its customers allowing EOSDIS to continue to receive high American Customer Satisfaction Index survey scores in an environment where the customers are more demanding and have higher expectations every year. EOSDIS is used extensively to obtain data and derived products for scientific research. This use can be measured by counting the number of publications resulting from EOSDIS data and the citations of such publications.","Legislative Mandate - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Act of 2015, under subtitle E - requires that the administrator shall  continue to carryout a balanced Earth science program that includes Earth science research , Earth systematic missions, competitive Venture class missions other missions and data analysis, mission operations, technology development, and applied sciences, consistent with the recommendations and priorities established in the National Academies EarthScience Decadal Survey.

Without data on the full range of services MAO enrollees receive, CMS is limited in its ability to review the MA program annual contracting bids and conduct comparative effectiveness research.  The FY 2009 rule (73 FR 48650) reasserted CMS’ authority to collect data from MAO's.  Based on this ruling, CMS requires MAO's to submit encounter data for dates of service January 3, 2012 and later. This date is consistent with the current industry movement towards standardization of data collection formats, common edit modules, transition to ICD-10 diagnosis and HIPAA compliance measures. This investment has developed and implemented a new Encounter Data System (EDS) to collect MAO beneficiary per-visit health care encounter data using the HIPAA 5010 version of the X12 standards; which edits, prices and stores the data.  The EDS will enable calculation of new risk coefficients that will more accurately reflect the demographics, patterns of care, and the predicted costs of diseases for MAO enrollees. This will result in more accurate risk adjustment data to provide to the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx) for monthly payment calculation for payments to MAO's. The EDS data will also enable analysis of health care utilization and will enable service utilization and quality comparisons across the original Medicare and MA programs. This will result in more accurate payments to plans, and enable value-based purchasing initiatives-thus supporting the HHS Objective 1.3-Improve health care quality, safety, cost and value.","009SO18204 - Promote affordable healthcare, while balancing spending on premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs, 009SO18206 - Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The nature of the EDPS system does not align with standard ROI analysis. We conducted an alternative analysis to qualitatively analyze the benefits of EDPS in accordance with the statutory requirements for Encounter Data collection. The analysis performed against three identified technical options for the EDPS system resulted in a positive NPV for the current technical solution and a negative NPV for two other potential technical solution paths that explored a steady state activity and previously from a cost savings / avoidance perspective In FY18 we transitioned and procured a new system at the average cost of the old system on an annual basis and this will lead to an average of $7.5M per year savings moving forward. The transition to a cloud based infrastructure allows CMS to be better positioned and respond to an increasing MA population and submission patterns of Encounter Data. Encounter Data is collected following guidance provided by Final Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) rule. In that rule, revised regulation clarifies CMS’ authority to require MAOs submit encounter data for each item and service provided to MA enrollees. Additionally beginning with payment year (PY) 2015, CMS began using encounter data as an additional source of diagnoses for risk adjustment payment to MAOs. For payment years 2016 and 2017, CMS continued the transition moving towards use of encounter data as the sole source of plan-submitted diagnosis information.","The Social Security Act Section 1857(d) provides CMS with the legislative authority to audit the MA organizations based on the information collected from them. www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/. Each contract under this section of the Act shall provide that the Secretary, or any person or organization designated by the Secretary, shall have the right to audit and inspect any books and records of the MA organization that pertain to the ability of the organization to bear the risk of potential financial losses, or to services performed or determinations of amounts payable under the contract.  The President has issued an order to reduce improper payments while continuing to ensure the Federal programs serve and provide access to the beneficiaries.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial_fia_improper.Regulations also provide authority.  The final 2009 inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) rule, published August 19, 2008 - 73 FR 48434 ff – revised 42 CFR 422.310(d) to reassert that CMS has the authority to require MA Organizations and other entities to submit encounter data for each item and service provided to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MAO and other entities.  http://www.regulations.gov/.

The Encounter Data System will enable CMS to accomplish the agency-wide goal to achieving accurate and predictable payments, specifically, payments made to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAO's), through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx). The collection of encounter data will enable CMS to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the health care services provided to Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollees. This data will enable CMS to pay more accurately as the MA risk adjustment models will be calibrated on MA diagnosis and costs verses Fee-for-Service data. CMS will be able to analyze the quality, quantity, and types of health care services Medicare beneficiaries are receiving in the MA program.

DEERS began operations in 1979 and today affects every individual affiliated with the Department of Defense (DoD), maintaining records for more than 50 million service members, employees, contractors, Veterans and beneficiaries in the DEERS Person Data Repository (PDR).  

DEERS PDR provides a consolidated, centralized data collection, drawn from Uniformed Services and civilian employee personnel systems, augmented by contractor, pay and manpower data, allowing the Department to reduce and eliminate redundant data collections.  PDR data drives access to facilities, systems and benefits, while providing the accurate, up-to-date information needed to manage Department personnel and missions.
  
- DEERS receives more than 4 million identity or benefits inquiries daily.  Response times average less than 2 seconds, with 99.5 percent database availability worldwide.  
- DEERS processes information from the Uniformed Services within 24 hours of receipt to ensure accurate, up-to-date records for DoD personnel.
- DEERS supports mobilization activities within 24 hours of notification.
- DEERS reduce average issuance times for DoD identification cards.
- DEERS supports financial readiness for Service Members, maintaining 99.99 percent uptime despite transaction volume increasing by 50 percent.
- DEERS enhances security and law enforcement workflow for specific populations.

The key customers for DEERS include the Department of Defense, the Defense Health Agency, the seven Uniformed Services, Veterans Affairs (VA), Health and Human Service (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS), Department of Labor (DOL), State Departments of Veterans Affairs and Labor, and all Active Duty/Guard/Reserve Service Members, Retirees and Dependents.  Additional stakeholders include all DoD agencies, the Unified Combatant Commands, and other Federal agencies..","007SO18267 - Lay the foundation for future readiness through recapitalization, innovation, and modernization","As a service provider for DoD and other agencies, DEERS operations return largely intangible benefits, through improved personnel identification and security, consistent determination and application of benefits, and Congressional and public reporting.  Tangible savings and cost-avoidance commonly accrue to other agencies, but rarely come directly to DEERS.

- Military Lending Act (MLA) applications reduced predatory lending practices aimed at military personnel. An obvious boon to morale, MLA also helps reduce separations due to revoked clearances.  GAO-11-170 estimated that a separation costs $58,250; PERSEREC reported 1,600 separations in 2014.  A conservative 10% reduction in separations each year will save an estimated $9.2M.

- MilConnect eCorrespondence permits cost avoidance of roughly $2M a year for Defense Health by replacing US Postal Service mailings with electronic correspondence.  milConnect is sustained by $600k in DMDC direct funds annually.

- Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) Online Enrollment System (SOES).  SOES allows Service Members to set up and modify their SGLI enrollment decisions online by leveraging data already available in DEERS.  Full implementation of SOES will complete in mid-2018, with an expected ROI of $1.4M per year.  This is based on estimates from the VA, which administers SGLI, that there are $15M in SGLI overpayments over the FYDP due to the use of paper forms.  SOES implementation and sustainment was funded by P&R at $8M over the FYDP. While the ROI of $1.4M a year will be realized by the VA, DoD will benefit intangibly, as more efficient and effective SGLI elections ultimately translate into more timely and accurate settlements for survivors of military loss.

- Military Health Care depends upon DEERS determination of health care benefits based on complex and rapidly changing entitlements.  Each medical encounter requires a real-time DEERS determination of eligiblity for DoD health care, as does each TRICARE claim.  While DHA does not document its savings directly, these checks prevent fraud and support recovery actions when needed.

As demand for DEERS data and services continues to grow. it is reasonable to expect such savings to continue.  However, it is also likely that the operations and maintenance of the as-Is DEERS system will become cost-prohibitive if we do not modernize and improve capabilities..","THe most significant are:

GCSS-Army modernizes logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, logistics management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  This effort implements a comprehensive logistics automated solution for the Army and provides the commander on and off the battlefield with an integrated and interoperable end-to-end view of the logistics chain, equipment status and asset visibility to support decisions that will affect the outcome of combat operations, combat power and planning for future operations.  This solution implements Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products from the company System, Application and Product, Aktiengesellschaft (SAP AG).  This also allowed the Army to retire multiple custom designed standalone business software baselines optimized to existing Army business processes and replaced them with a single integrated business software baseline that has been optimized to industry defined best business practices.  It eliminates the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.  

The primary stakeholders, customers and beneficiaries of GCSS-Army are: Logistics Managers and Planners, Resource Managers, Commanders at all levels and Logistics Domain Owners.  This investment interacts with Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) and Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army. GCSS-Army customers are in every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, DOL and property book office in the total Army, improving efficiency and visibility for nearly 179,000 users globally.

The Army should also achieve cost avoidances of $1,948.9M and productivity improvements of $8,810.9M. The details of these efficiencies
are:
-Estimated Class II (Individual equipment), III (Fuel), IV (Construction materials) and IX (Repair parts/spares) inventory right-sizing benefit of $348.5M. 
-Estimated inventory efficiencies of $370.4M from improved reparable tracking and turn-ins. 
-Estimated reduction in STAMIS IT costs of $1,003.7M. 
-Estimated efficiencies in reorder costs, totaling $1,229.9M. 
-Estimated Army efficiencies that will be obtained by personnel time or added value of services totaling $8,810.9M. 
The estimated benefit of $348.5M represents the right-sizing of inventory (Class II, III packaged, IV, and IX supplies at tactical & retail SSAs) across the supply chain.
Estimated inventory efficiencies of $370.4M in reparable turn-ins represents efficiencies the Army could achieve by reducing the number of items needed by execution of more efficient business processes. Units will be able to identify, track, and turn-in a higher number of reparable items.
The ERP system forces the turn-in of old items before ordering new and give leaders visibility of the all repair items.
The estimated efficiency in reorder costs of $1,229.9M represents the efficiencies that the Army could achieve by reducing costs with multiple reorders of lost, wrong, or delayed shipments. Units will be able to track and redirect shipments of items. The ERP system will not allow the unit to reorder the same item, unless it's for a separate effort or justification.
The Estimated efficiency benefit of improved business processes & reduction in other Logistics (LOG) IT system costs, totaling $8,810.9M is due to improved business processes.
All the other current LOG IT systems (beyond STAMIS) in the LOG Domain could benefit by GCSS-Army AFTER the initial deployment of the GCSS-Army solution.
The efficiency benefits will significantly reduce the burden placed on our Soldiers in the field. The benefits DO NOT imply that we should reduce the number of Soldiers in today's Army. Rather, these benefits will more effectively employ those soldiers.
Now that GCSS-Army is fully deployed and being sustained, the combat developer is monitoring and measuring the achieved benefits.

No single existing Army Logistics sustainment system is capable of retrieving all information from multiple data storage sites to anticipate force projection support requirements, identify location of available assets and synchronize the movement/distribution of logistics resources. It is impractical for the Army to properly track supplies and equipment, operational costs and total cost of ownership for individual items or units, selected forces, or for the entire Army as required by a Title 10 US Code statutory mandate. GCSS-Army, one of the Army's four ERP systems, continues to close this operational gap by retiring existing legacy systems.

DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving.  DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer. 

DTS receives annual support funding from Services & Agencies; for FY17 and out, the estimated funding received will be $27.2M.  The Services & Agencies are currently required to note these amounts within SNAP-IT.

IPP produces and publishes the U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes (MPIs and XPIs) and PPI produces and publishes the Producer Price Indexes (PPIs). These are Principal Federal Economic Indicators (PFEIs) of inflationary trends in the economy used by both the public and private sectors. The President, Congress, and the Federal Reserve (Fed) employ these data in formulating fiscal and monetary policies. 

The purpose of IPS is to operate, maintain, and modernize the IPP and PPI computing systems that support their six areas of business: sampling, initiation, monthly pricing, calculation of index estimates, publication, and managing index structures and weights. To control long-run IT costs, IPP and PPI managers ultimately envision single systems supporting each of the six business production processes and replacing the separate legacy systems each program has today. IPS also aims to improve the quality of MPIs, XPIs, and PPIs and provide additional measures sought by customers. IPS benefits the public by effectively and efficiently maintaining and operating its systems on supported software in a secure environment, ensuring the PFEIs are produced on time and sensitive data are not at risk of unauthorized release. By providing IT services that enable IPP and PPI to produce accurate, objective, relevant, timely, and accessible inflation statistics, the investment aligns with DOL Strategic Objective 1.4: Provide timely, accurate, and relevant information on labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy.

The key customers of IPS are the IPP and PPI programs whose stakeholders and beneficiaries include the U.S. public; government entities, such as the Fed and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA); and private industry. BEA uses PPIs to deflate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) component of its quarterly National Income and Product Account (NIPA) and MPIs/XPIs to deflate the foreign trade component of NIPA and to deflate its monthly merchandise trade data. Private industry uses PPIs for contract price adjustment. The Internal Revenue Service suggests that firms use PPI data for calculating one particular method of inventory accounting. Other customers use PPIs, MPIs, and XPIs for market research, inventory valuation, exchange rate analysis, and to assess U.S. competitiveness in world markets.","012SO18065 - Provide timely, accurate, and relevant information on labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy.","The most recent CBA reflects that the benefits of the current operation, maintenance, and modernization efforts of the IPS investment exceed the costs for achieving its objectives. In addition to the highest ROI of 267.8%, the selected alternative presented the least risk, highest adjusted life cycle benefits, lowest adjusted life cycle costs, and the highest net present value (NPV). Also, the selected alternative is the most beneficial to IPS in architectural fit, maintenance, and reuse. It leverages the BLS Central Oracle and WebLogic facilities already in place and were designed to consolidate or eliminate redundant components across different BLS programs. HTML5 and AngularJS should prove easier to maintain and utilize for future modernization and enhancement efforts as they should be stable through the 2020s.

IPS primarily benefits the PPI and IPP programs by effectively and efficiently operating and maintaining their system on supported software in a secure environment, ensuring a 99.5% application availability to support the programs  operations towards on-time data publication of MPIs, XPIs, and PPIs. IPS helps the two programs achieve strategic and business results and high customer satisfaction by 1) preventing IT processing or system errors that directly cause missed publication dates or corrections to previous public releases announced in an errata on the BLS public website, and 2) by adapting IT to support new business goals, including those goals stated in Section C.2.1. PPI and IPP aim to improve methods and outputs and to fill gaps listed in the Operational Analysis, especially non-IT issues that demand attention based on customer input (U.S. government agencies, statistical partners, data providers, data users, and the media). These include improving the quality and relevance of MPIs, XPIs, and PPIs by expanding service-sector coverage, producing new products that gauge U.S. competitiveness and compare IPP and PPI outputs, developing methods for better quality adjustments, and incorporating large datasets from alternative sources ( big data ).

IPS secondarily benefits the programs' data users. BEA uses PPI data to adjust for inflation in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) component of its quarterly National Income and Product Account (NIPA). BEA uses IPP data to adjust for inflation in the foreign trade component of NIPA and to deflate its monthly merchandise trade data. The resulting real trade flows help explain the dynamics underlying international trade. Private industry uses PPI data for contract price adjustment. BLS estimates that agreements with a lifetime worth in the trillions of dollars are currently adjusted using the PPI indexes either alone or in conjunction with other sources of economic data. The Internal Revenue Service suggests that firms use PPI data for calculating one particular method of inventory accounting. IPP data is used in various ways to measure a country s international competitiveness. Private businesses make extensive use of PPI and IPP data for planning and operations and compare the prices they pay for material inputs as well as prices they receive for products that they make and sell with changes in similar MPIs, XPIs, and PPIs.

The Integrated Work Management (IWM) is a CDER-wide initiative that provides users with access to CDER’s strategic capabilities and supporting tools via a seamless user experience.
 
Goals:
CDER is looking to enhance and expand IWM so it can be deployed Center-wide as the system of record for work planning that relates to regulatory deliverables, as well as supplements and complements the official systems of records. This management solution will help manage a portfolio of work assignments for the Center.
 
IWM aligns to several FDA strategies including the FDA Strategic Priority goals of Lean Management and Business Modernization. IWM also aligns to goals within the CDER Strategic Plan, FDA Information Management and Office of Information Management Strategic Plan, PDUFA/GDUFA Information Technology (Draft) Plan, GDUFA User Fee Goals, and PDUFA User Fee Goals.
 
Current/Anticipated Benefits:
The provision of an improved management capability for cross-functional teams that will help improve their management, tracking and reporting of work commitments will be beneficial to all stakeholders throughout the center. Additional benefits from Integrated Work Management include:
·         Improved control of information as a result of having a central repository;
·         Improved performance as a result of tracking information in one central location versus tracking in multiple systems or spreadsheets;
·         Increased data minimization, which is one of the goals of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) to better utilize government data.
 
IWM also helps CDER realize the efficiencies identified as part of the PDUFA, GDUFA and BsUFA commitments.

IDENT expanded its customer base and services provided to those customers by retrofitting functionalities and components to the existing foundation to meet urgent mission needs.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The demand for IDENT services continues to grow rapidly in response to the needs of system users and stakeholders. OBIM conducted multiple DHS and independent assessments and studies to identify required capabilities and to verify the gaps in the current system. While the large scale, unique, and complex IDENT system generally meets today’s performance expectations, IDENT is at risk, and will not be able to meet DHS capability needs in the mid or long term—such as servicing existing customers’ projected growth volumes or adding needed multimodal services—let alone support Congressional, Administration, or Departmental emergent priorities such as biometric exit. As a result, OBIM is pursuing the acquisition and development of HART to continue to provide biometric identity services to support DHS missions, and resolve critical system issues with the current IDENT system. The benefits of the replacement system include: addressing the mission failure risk of the legacy system; achieving operations and maintenance cost efficiencies; improving detection and derogatory information matching; providing multimodal biometric services. IDENT supports DHS QHSR findings and strategy for an integrated Homeland Security Enterprise for DHS and its components, other Federal departments, State, local, and tribal law enforcement, the intelligence community, and foreign partners. It is an integrated component of a networked Homeland Security Enterprise that addresses multi-threat, all-hazard security considerations. IDENT data and analysis helps secure and protect the U.S. against terrorism, enables data integration and analysis, supports and strengthens responsive immigration processing systems and law enforcement, minimizes disruptions to the trade and travel system, and supports a smarter, stronger border by enhancing our security infrastructure through support to new technologies. IDENT aligns with preventing terrorism and enhancing security, securing and managing our borders, and enforcing and administering our immigration laws as stated in the QHSR. IDENT’s crosscutting mission alignments with the current and pending DHS Strategic Plans enables Department unity of effort.","OBIM’s IDENT system, as an investment, meets legislative mandates such as P.L. 113-6 that designated OBIM as the lead entity within DHS responsible for biometric identity management services to ensure that the homeland is safe, secure, and resilient. Evolving from the US-VISIT program in 2013, OBIM serves as an enterprise-level service provider, with cross-cutting responsibilities to serve DHS Components and other mission partners such as the Departments of Justice (DOJ), State (DOS), and Defense (DOD); state, local, and tribal law enforcement; the Intelligence Community; and foreign government partners. Again in P.L. 113-76 this lead entity role is restated showing the critical importance of the investment (IDENT) in support the DHS mission. OBIM provides biometric identity services through the IDENT, which stores biometric identities and conducts recurrent matching against derogatory information. OBIM analysts also provide human biometric verification and search capabilities, updates to the IDENT biometric watchlist, and responses to requests for IDENT biometric records to support analytical, investigative, and operational needs of customers and partners.  By matching, storing, sharing, and analyzing biometric data, OBIM provides decision makers on the front lines of homeland security with rapid, accurate, and secure identity services as required by public law. This investment and OBIM’s associated goals are aligned with the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) and DHS strategic goals and priorities, as well as with updated priorities outlined in the DHS 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and it does not have any outstanding audit or material weaknesses. The IDENT system as an investment supports Presidential Directives such as the Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) - 6: Integration and Use of Screening Information to Protect Against Terrorism.

ADIS accomplishes this by matching automated entry & exit records of foreign nationals into a consolidated travel history, and by providing biographic identity & overstay status services to customers & stakeholders.  
ADIS’ goal - to prevent illegal entry, exit, and overstay - directly supports the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review’s Mission Goals:  2.1 Effective Control of U.S. Air, Land, Sea Borders and Approaches, 2.2 Safeguard Lawful Trade and Travel, and 3.2 Prevent Unlawful Immigration.
  
ADIS qualitative benefits include assistance in determining admissibility, law enforcement action, Visa approval/denial, Visa Waiver Program eligibility, and the support for anticipated immigration reform and expansion of biometric and biographic exit activities.  The Investment benefits users by matching travel events with immigration status to provide an overstay status.  ADIS contributes to DHS Missions - 2) Secure & Manage Our Borders and 3) Enforce and Administer Our Immigration Laws - by looking at arrival & departure data collectively from multiple sources to determine whether a person departed the U.S. on time or if they legally extended their immigration status.
  
Internal DHS customers, who are also stakeholders, are CBP, OBIM, ICE, USCIS, TSA, & USCG. External customers, who are also stakeholders, include Department of State (DOS) and the intelligence community.  ADIS incorporates data elements & transactions associated with CBP systems & other immigration systems to create & maintain complete histories on 373M travelers & processes more than 3.3M transactions a day.  ADIS services are expanding - the Department of Commerce and Social Security Administration (SSA) are new customers expected in FY19 and includes a 24/7 help desk and system uptime of 98% or greater.  ADIS enables DHS to comply with Congressional, legislative, operational, and executive mandates by helping to determine if foreign nationals have overstayed terms of admission and enhances homeland security by providing a cost-effective response to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the U.S.","024SO18227 - Not Available","ADIS is an inherited post Full Operational Capability operational investment and as such does not have an identified ""return on investment.""  However, ADIS produces significant cost avoidance benefits to the nation that include enhanced border security & enforcement of U.S. immigration laws by serving as the Department's primary provider of overstay status and biographic identity services.  Deployed data exchange upgrades and matching process improvements shortened the overstay vetting process, reducing the time ICE takes to act on an overstay from 45 days to 15 or fewer days.  Enhancements to the overstay population also contributed to further data integrity improvements in the annual Congressional Overstay Report.  The efficiency gained is replacing a one-time yearly data call using significant manual resources with a modern real-time reporting environment.  The real time data exchange with the Intelligence Community also eliminates a one-month data delay and the need for manual/bulk data updates transferred historically by human courier.  Any delay in data touch points pointing to subjects arriving and departing the country creates a gap in information for making national security decisions.
  
By closing these information gaps, efficiencies are gained across the federal government in sharing data more effectively in a real time, leading to reduced analytic costs for the Intelligence Community in searching multiple systems for similar data and reduction in human resources needed to support the existing manual exchanges.  In 2019 and 2020, CBP plans to expand its data sharing capabilities with the Department of Commerce, Social Security Administration and other Government agencies and use the reporting environment for the statistics of the FY18 Entry/Exit Overstay Report.","ADIS supports DHS in meeting the below legislative mandates by demonstrating the capabilities requested by releasing the Entry/Exit Overstay Report each fiscal year:  https://www.dhs.gov/publication/entryexit-overstay-report

This service enables biometric identity verification by using the traveler’s facial image compared to photos existing in government image repositories. Currently, CBP confirms a traveler’s arrival and departure at air and sea ports using the biographic information on a government-issued document, such as a passport. The addition of biometric matching provides greater assurance of the identity of the traveler. At land ports of entry (POE), CBP has had no feasible way to determine a departing traveler’s identity using biographic information since this information has not been required to leave the country. The goal is to provide greater assurance of traveler identity through biometric confirmation to achieved four primary benefits: 1) enhanced ability to confirm that a non-U.S. citizen has complied with the terms of admission to the U.S.; 2) more effective identification of travelers who have overstayed their lawful period of admission and may be subject to additional scrutiny when applying for a visa or a travel authorization to return to the U.S.; 3) strengthened capability to interdict and deter the fraudulent use of travel documents and identify individuals who may be subject to law enforcement action; 4) improved accuracy of the annual DHS Entry/Exit Overstay Report required by Congress. CBP stakeholders are using the initial delivery of a biometric matching service, but new iterations are being tested to involve other key DHS stakeholders and customers--Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA). CBP and the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) work together to share information that can help expand DHS biometric capabilities to meet the needs for any DHS component.Airlines, ocean cruise lines, and air and sea port authorities are the key private sector and organizational customers for the biometric matching service. The travelling public will benefit from a more streamlined and secure travel process while airlines benefit from the backend infrastructure developed by the federal government that assists in confirmation of travelers entering and exiting the country.","024SO18227 - Not Available","Based on data collected to date, the Biometric Entry-Exit investment may provide significant return on investment (ROI) by developing and deploying the Traveler Verification Service (TVS), a biometric matching service, which utilizes cloud services and an agile development approach. This enables the rapid deployment of a comprehensive biometric entry and exit solution. TVS will provide biometric matching services for all travel modes including air, land and sea. The qualitative benefits deriving from this comprehensive solution are being realized today in the commercial air exit environment. The solution builds on a partnership with the air travel industry based on a cost-sharing model with airlines and airports. In this partnership, CBP is working with air transportation stakeholders to lead the transformation of air travel using biometrics as the key to enhancing security, and dramatically improve the entire traveler experience. CBP is realizing the benefit of a greater assurance of traveler identity through the use of biometrics without negatively impacting the airline boarding process, For example, one of CBP’s biometric exit partners has reported that the new process allows it to reduce boarding time of an A380, the largest passenger plane in operation, from 50 to 20 minutes. In this partnership, airports or airlines purchase, operate, and maintain the biometric capture device at each departure gate. Each device costs on average $30,000-$40,000 for each of the 2,000 gates where this equipment is installed. Additionally, airports are updating existing infrastructure and network connections and developing their own software to communicate with CBP’s TVS. The program conservatively estimates a cost savings of $60 million just in the procurement of the biometric capture devices -- a significant quantitative benefit. Additional cost savings will be further realized as airlines and airports operate and maintain the devices along with any infrastructure investments. For air entry operations, CBP’s new simplified arrival process quickly and reliably uses the traveler’s face to biometrically verify identity and retrieve traveler records automatically. Current data shows that arriving passengers clear customs processing 35 percent faster with the new biometric process that eliminates manual, time consuming steps such as document scans and fingerprint captures, which delay the inspection process. With a faster clearance process, airlines, airports, and travelers benefit from shorter connection times and standardized arrival procedures. In land operations, CBP is exploring through technology demonstrations the use of a gallery of expected border crossers and validating the concept of “face as a token” to close the arrival/departure reporting gap in the pedestrian and vehicle environment. Additional benefits that may be realized include replacing the use of travel documents to facilitate the border crossing experience. Unlike the air environment, CBP will procure, operate, and maintain biometric capture devices. As the technology demonstrations continue, the program will identify all costs associated with the deployment of this capability at CBP’s land ports of entry. Since sea and air operations are similar, CBP is using the air exit model and the establishment of a partnership with cruise line operators who will procure, operate, and maintain the biometric capture devices.","The Biometric Entry-Exit investment was established in response to the 9/11 Commission Report, Section 12.4, pp. 383-89 (http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch12.pdf) which detailed the inability to verify traveler identity upon departure from the U.S. and the Commission's recommendation to build a biometric entry-exit system which is an “essential investment in our national security.” A key driver for the program is the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113, §410(g), 129 STAT. 3006, https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ113/PLAW-114publ113.pdf ), in which Congress established a biometric entry-exit fee that will provide up to $1 billion in funding over a 10-year period.  An additional driver is Executive Order 13780, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States” issued on March 6, 2017 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states), which directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expedite the implementation of the biometric entry-exit system.
To meet these mandates, CBP is deploying the TVS to enable biometric matching using the traveler’s facial image at departure from U.S. air, land, and sea ports. In the air environment, CBP is working with airlines and airport authorities to deploy facial image cameras that will collect traveler photos in the jetway, pass the photo to TVS, and return a board / no-board response to the camera. In a case of a no-board, instructions are provided to local CBP Officers on what actions need to be taken to allow the traveler to board or if other law enforcement action is required. CBP will deploy a capability at seaports similar to that used in airports and is working with ocean cruise lines to incorporate this biometric matching capability into the boarding process.  In the land environment, CBP is assessing how facial images will be captured from individuals leaving the country by foot or vehicle and is designing technology demonstrations that will further detail operational requirements.",yes,yes,yes,,,"Colleen Manaher","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",72.620000,90.550000,71.000000,71.000000,2017,2031,"The discrepancy in funding levels in CY 2019 is due to the reduction in fees collected through the biometric entry-exit fee account.

The program was also granted permission to continue testing the Biometric Air Exit pilot at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and to conduct technology demonstrations as needed. All required ADE-2A acquisition documents were approved and the program received ADE-2A approval for Air Exit during an ARB held on May 2, 2018. As an action from the ARB, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established a Biometrics Executive Steering Committee (ESC), which should help identify appropriate relationship between DHS biometric programs, including CBP, OBIM, and others. 
The program is targeting an ADE-2B for Air Exit in October/November 2018. The ADE-2B will be supported by finalization of the Integrated Logistics Support Plan and Test and Evaluation Master Plan, as well as an updated Certification of Funds memo and Integrated Master Schedule. The program faces funding challenges due to decreasing fee collections. This impact can be minimized in the short-term with carryover funds and reduction in enforcement officers, but long-term funding solutions will be necessary to address the funding short-fall and the termination of fee funding in 2025.

The largest financial and technical system within this investment is NFIP Information Technology Systems (ITS) which is supported by legacy mainframe technologies application that processes all the Write-Your-Own (WYO) insurance company flood policy and claims transactions.  Without the capability embodied by the IT S&S investment, the NFIP would be unable to process flood insurance policies and claims for more than 5.3 million flood policies.  The Investment IT S&S also includes a few other smaller systems including the Reinsurance Broker System (RBS) and the NFIP Direct Services Agent (DSA) which contribute to the overall NFIP business. Without the capability embodied by the IT S&S investment, the NFIP would be unable to process flood insurance policies and claims for more than 5.3 million flood policies.   
  
The IT S&S investment is critical to mission attainment, helping facilitate flood insurance transactions like policy issuance and claims payments to flood survivors.   IT S&S supports the following DHS and FEMA missions and strategic goals: DHS Mission 5 (Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience), Strategic Goal 1 (Build a Culture of Preparedness), Objective 1.1 (Incentive investments that reduce risk) and Objective 1.2 (Close the Insurance Gap), and FEMA Strategic Goal 2 (Ready the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters). The key benefit of this investment is the continued operation of the NFIP and implementation of legislative reforms from Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.   
  
Key investment stakeholders include: policyholders, FEMA components, FIMA, the Direct Servicing Agent, WYO Insurance companies, insurance vendors, adjusters, insurance agents, communities, and others. It is important tonote this investment is slated for disposal/decommission and to be replaced by Pivot; described in its' own investment with UII 07128. This investment will be retired as the NFIP system of record in BY20 and fully disposed in BY21.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The IT S&S is an investment in sustainment that has been operational since 1983.  As such, no ROI has been formally quantified.  The NFIP IT S&S has been in production for over 30 years.  Given this length of time, it is likely that this system has provided a very favorable return on its original investment.  Additionally, this system allows the NFIP to sell flood insurance and pay claims to U.S. persons in a time of flooding disaster. However, it is important to note that ITS&S is being modernized and replaced by Pivot (UII 7128) and the ROI for this investment has been recently calculated. 
 
As described in responses to accomplishment questions later in the business case the continued operation of the Legacy Support System (ITS) is critical to the day-to-day operation of the NFIP as are the support functions provided by the continued work funded under the BSA contract. Until the new SOR is available under Pivot, both are critical to NFIP’s ability to update program documentation; respond to flooding disasters by opening Flood Response Offices (FRO), and providing training to key stakeholders, including claims adjusters. This investment benefits the general public by serving as the System of Record for over 5 million policyholders and more than 22,000 participating communities. In addition to the participating communities those who boarder those communities receive a heighted awareness of flooding. Without the continued operation of the IT S&S, FEMA would be unable to provide flood coverage, which ensures policyholders have access to insurance payments in the event of flooding disasters. More over the taxpayers are rarely contributing to the NFIP due to being funded through the premiums the policyholders pay .","Currently there are no Outstanding Audit findings or Material weaknesses.

The Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) was created by Executive Order 13411 for the purpose of improving the delivery of assistance to survivors of disasters. The goals of the program are: to provide disaster survivors a portal to all available forms of assistance, to provide federal agencies an effective automated data interchange, to reduce costs, and to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse. The benefits of investment in DAIP include:  eased burden on disaster survivors, improved service delivery and reduced duplicative costs by multiple agencies. DAIP provides a central portal reducing the cost and technical barriers to participation for federal agencies; increasing the number and types of assistance available, streamlining delivery of services and improving internal controls. 
 
Contribution to Mission Delivery: 
DAIP supports the DHS strategic goal tied to both the QHSR and the DHS multi-year Strategic Plan. DAIP Supports DHS Mission 5: Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience and FEMA’s core mission of ”Helping people before, during, and after disasters.” DAIP is directly engaged with activities to support FEMA’s strategic goals, especially Goal 3: Reduce the Complexity of FEMA. DAIP supports DHS FEMA’s efforts to comply with the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. 
Key Customers, Stakeholders, and Other Beneficiaries: 
 
Beneficiaries of the DAIP and DisasterAssistance.gov are the survivors of disasters (American tax payers, the general public and small businesses). Stakeholders of DAIP include 17 Federal Agencies such as FEMA, DHS, SBA, HUD, and SSA. The beneficiaries and primary users of DAIP (DisasterAssistance.gov) are survivors of federally declared disasters, the American tax payer, the general public, small businesses, local communities, and the 17 federal agency stakeholders that sponsor the program. Collaboration with other agencies through DAIP ensuresa coordinated Federal approach to the delivery of disaster assistance. DAIP collaborates with nonprofit organizations and tribal, state, and local governments to identify additional resources to include on the portal that would be beneficial to disaster survivors.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) was created in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to alleviate disaster survivors’ frustration when dealing with multiple federal programs and to ensure survivors receive prompt and efficient access to federal disaster assistance. DAIP measures program value by consistently monitoring performance to demonstrate the program is meeting the needs of the Agency and to ensure the program delivers expected value. DAIP is reducing costs and improving efficiencies by streamlining and consolidating the delivery of disaster assistance to survivors.  This single, online application eases the burden on disaster survivors and increases their access to disaster relief by creating a continually updated information clearinghouse that provides information on the benefits most valuable to a disaster survivor, such as housing, food and employment aid in both English and Spanish. DisasterAssistance.gov reduces the time needed to apply for aid and check the status of claims while decreasing redundancy in application forms and processes. DAIP’s web portal provides cost avoidance to FEMA for every registration or account inquiry done on-line or mobile device over traditional call-center or in-person applications. As shown in the Hurricane Sandy response, the DisasterAssistance.gov portal provides a cost effective alternative to increasing call center capacity and volume without any additional cost to the American Taxpayer. DAIP improves government efficiencies at FEMA, DHS and across the federal government.  This investment centralizes multiple disaster survivor databases, application processes and information channels thereby improving utilization and efficiency.  DAIP’s application processing allows for survivors to apply for multiple forms of assistance across multiple agencies and programs with built in protections against waste, fraud and abuse. For the period of actual and simulated activity, the sum of planning costs is $34.037M, DME, excluding planning costs, are $66.885M. O&M costs are $166.507M, for a total AoA Life Cycle Cost of $267.430M. The values of six benefit classifications have been evaluated. The AoA conducted in FY 2015 was based across the time span FY 2015 through FY 2023, DAIP has projected net benefits of $687.036M offset by a costs of $134.315M yielding a simple ROI of 4.11%, that is, each dollar invested returns greater than four dollars.  These benefits are split between the taxpayer in reduced costs and additional services provided to the disaster survivor. The benefits of investing in DAIP will continue to improve service delivery, assist survivors and reduce duplicative costs by multiple agencies. Since the primary focus and mission of DAIP is to expedite and improve the delivery of assistance to survivors of disasters, virtually every operational performance metric associated with DAIP is related to customer satisfaction. These performance metrics are monitored and updated every month and illustrate a consistent level of performance in delivering improved access to disaster resources (especially compared with pre-Katrina processes and timelines). The current DAIP modernization effort will ensure that the Program continues to fulfill its charter to ease the burden on disaster survivors by providing them with a portal to all available forms of assistance, to provide federal agencies an effective automated data interchange, to reduce costs, and to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse.","Presidential Direction (i.e. Presidential Directive, Presidential Memorandum, or Executive Order): The Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) was the direct result of Executive Order 13411, which directs the federal government to improve the delivery of assistance to disaster survivors by providing a centralized application process for Federal disaster assistance, providing a centralized and continuously updated clearinghouse from which disaster survivors may obtain information regarding Federal disaster assistance, and state and local government and private sector sources of disaster assistance, and reducing fraud, waste, and abuse.  https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/13411.pdf

The IPAWS mission provides integrated services and capabilities to Federal, State, Territorial, Tribal, and Local authorities enabling them to alert and warn their respective communities. IPAWS program goals established to accomplish the mission: 1) Create, maintain and evolve an integrated interoperable environment for alert and warning; 2) Make alert and warning more effective; and 3) Strengthen the resilience of IPAWS infrastructure. Key IPAWS benefits are expanded capability and cost savings for local authorities leveraging IPAWS to distribute warning to local populations via cellular phone, radio & television, NOAA Weather Radio, and Internet applications, and a resilient capability for the President to warn the nation under all-hazards scenarios. IPAWS supports QHSR ""Mission 5: Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience"" and DHS ""Goal 5.3: Ensure Effective Emergency Response"". Public Information and Warning is a core capability to the National Preparedness Goal. Core capabilities are essential for the execution of each of the five mission areas: Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery. IPAWS is a national tool used by local, state, territorial and federal authorities to provide timely and effective warnings to people to reduce the loss of life and property and lower the cost of future disasters. Key customers of IPAWS are local, state, and federal authorities that send public alerts directly to citizens' cellular phones, radios, televisions, weather radios, and Internet connected devices. As of June 2018, 1,100 public alerting authorities (total states, territorial, local, tribal, & federal agencies) are using IPAWS. The National Weather Service and the DoJ National Center for Missing and Exploited Children are key stakeholders using the IPAWS to deliver weather and AMBER alerts across the nation. Additional key stakeholders include radio and TV broadcast, cable industry and the wireless service provider industry which depend upon IPAWS operations to meet federal regulatory requirements. The IPAWS primary beneficiaries are people who receive alerts enabling them to avoid danger, protect property, and save the lives of themselves and others.","024SO18227 - Not Available","ROI was calculated by dividing External Benefits by Total Program Cost (per signed LCCE, Dec 2016): ($688,218,000/$470,794,446.25) – 1 = 0.46. An ROI of .46 indicates that IPAWS increases benefits to society such that the initial investment is recovered & a return (savings in excess of original investment) is incurred. We defined External Benefits as estimated cost savings for federal agencies using IPAWS & the value of advanced/post alerts and warnings in the preservation of life and protection of property. This calculation uses quantitative analysis to capture both quantitative & qualitative benefits resulting from IPAWS.  
  
Cost Savings for Federal Agencies: IPAWS is free for public safety officials at all levels & allows users to leverage the federal investment to send alerts & warning to citizens. NCMEC cancelled a cellular alerting contract valued at approx. $1M/year when the AMBER Alert capability via IPAWS was initiated in Dec 2012. Estimated cost for the National Weather Service to implement a national cellular alerting capability independent of IPAWS is estimated at $2M/year. Numerous other state & local authorities have benefitted from the federal investment in IPAWS as a national standard for alert and warning vice independently investing in unique alert & warning capabilities on their own.  
  
Lives Saved by IPAWS: In our research we learned that weather warnings issued in response to tornadoes & hurricanes have been highly effective in providing advance warnings with protective action information to allow people to evacuate or seek shelter. IPAWS evaluated tornado & hurricane fatalities & found a significant decrease in loss of life and severe injuries over the last 9 years, compared to the same period prior to the launch of IPAWS. Since we cannot definitively attribute this difference to IPAWS, we conservatively attribute 10% of the difference in lives saved per year to IPAWS, resulting in 71.67 lives. Combined with the 53 children rescued as a direct result of AMBER Alerts sent through WEA (data from NCMEC, 3/20/18) this gives us a total of 124.67 lives saved by IPAWS.  
 
IPAWS plans to improve the amount of time IPAWS infrastructure is available for use & the time it takes to disseminate alerts & warnings to the public upon receipt. This enhances effectiveness & efficiency of warning messages to all people in a danger area, increasing the likelihood that people receive immediate warning information to afford the maximum amount of time to take action and avoid or mitigate the impact of disaster. Disaster impact avoidance & mitigation benefits society by enabling people to take protective measures, saving lives & reducing the cost of response & recovery activities after a disaster.  
  
IPAWS also aims to increase population covered by PEP Stations & local level public safety officials with IPAWS access. The integrated interoperable systems & open standards interfaces create a simple gateway between public safety officials & multiple communications systems supporting access to public alert & warning messages. The small IPAWS investment in infrastructure, agreements, & partnerships enables authorized agencies, incl. over 20,000 non-federal public safety officials, to utilize multiple private sector infrastructure investments to communicate emergency warning information to people.","The IPAWS Program was established to implement the requirements in EO 13407 to create a more “effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive system to alert and warn the American people” before, during, and after disasters.

The ROI formula has too many unpredictable components to be calculated precisely, but an ROI qualitative analysis is useful:
ROI=(((Original Baseline O&M - New Total O&M) + Other Benefits to Society)/Acquisition Cost Only)-1
   
The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2028 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in “benefits to society.”

These statutes require DHS to prevent individuals from entering a secure area of a vessel or facility unless the individual holds a transportation security card or is accompanied by another individual who holds a card.
 Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 2.0, dated June 2014, the TWIC program supports the PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY Mission and the Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio.  As of April 19, 2018, more than 4.8 million workers had applied for a TWIC.
 Goals: The TWIC program provides a vital security measure to ensure that individuals who pose a security threat do not gain unescorted access to secure areas of the nation’s maritime transportation industry. 
 Current or Anticipated Benefits: TSA (1) positively verifies each applicant’s claimed identity; (2) performs a security threat assessment on each applicant; and (3) produces and issues a TWIC card containing biometric and physical information for each applicant meeting the threat assessment eligibility requirements. The TWIC security threat assessment provides a terrorism/intelligence check, a criminal history records check, and an immigration check. TWICs are tamper-resistant biometric credentials. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential in compliance with regulatory requirements.
 Key Customers: Facility employees, longshoremen, merchant mariners, deckhands, long haul and drayage truck drivers, laborers, chemical facility workers, and others requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels.
 Stakeholdersand other Beneficiaries:  Extensive outreach to Congress; American Association of Port Authorities; National Association of Waterfront Employers; American Trucking Association; American Waterways Operators; Offshore Marine Service Association; Passenger Vessel Association; Intermodal Association of North America; International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union; Chemical Sector Coordinating Council (SCC), and others including the approximately 2800 MTSA-regulated facilities and 10,000 regulated vessels.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The benefit of the TWIC® program is that it improves security by a common nation-wide secure biometric credential that is used by operators of the national maritime transportation infrastructure to make access control decisions. The TWIC® program established standards and processes for enrollment, vetting, adjudication, redress, card issuance and activation.  In addition, TSA continuously monitors all TWIC® holders for terrorism risks and revokes credentials when the individual is no longer eligible for TWIC.  The TWIC program currently reports 7 key performance metrics:  Average Adjudication Total Accuracy Rate, Invalid Enrollment Rate, Customer Satisfaction, Average Wait Time, Operational Availability, Program Financial Commitment Variance, and Program Viability.  The TWIC program continually reviews metrics and in 2018, the TWIC program continues to evaluate existing performance measures to develop more effective metrics aligned with program objectives.  
 To calculate ROI, the program did a cash flow analysis using the TWIC Funding History report published by the TSA CFO which has the history of funding for the program up to September 30, 2017.  ROI for the TWIC program is calculated as (Cash In – Cash Out)/Cash Out.  Cash In is derived from two sources, appropriated funding provided early in the program and fee revenue collected from transportation workers once the program reached operational capability.  Consequently, as of September 30, 2017, Cash In (Appropriations) $155.875M + Cash In (Fees) $854.658M = $1010.533M; Cash Out (Expenses) = $538.069M; therefore, ROI = ($1010.533M-$538.069M)/$538.069M = 87.81%.  The details for this method are included in the first tab of the TWIC Funding History report which is uploaded.","Legislative Mandate:  The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002 requires DHS to issue a biometric transportation security card to those requiring unescorted access to MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels after determining the individual does not pose a security risk.  The TWIC program provides a secure credential and biometric security card for eligible transportation workers who require unescorted access to areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels.  TWIC positively identifies applicants by determining the authenticity of identity documentation, and it conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) on each individual, including continuous vetting against Terrorist Screening Databases.
 
 Agency Strategic Plan:  TWIC supports DHS Strategic Goal 1.1 – Prevent Terrorist Attacks and Goal 1.3 Reduce Risk to the Nation’s Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events.  Via enrollment and vetting processes, TWIC prevents ineligible applicants from obtaining a TWIC card.   Also, TWIC supports TSA Strategic Goal 1.0 - Establish a risk-based approach to all operations to identify, manage, and mitigate risk in all TSA lines of business, and Goal 2.0 - External Engagement - Sustain transparent and proactive relationships with external stakeholders and the traveling public.  The TWIC program’s enrollment, vetting, and adjudication processes maintain effective controls to mitigate the risk of an ineligible applicant obtaining a TWIC card.  The TWIC program uses customer service strategies, a stakeholder communications committee, visits to individual facilities and Coast Guard districts/sectors, and speaking at national stakeholder conferences and meetings to maintain communication with transportation workers and maritime industry representatives.
 Outstanding GAO Audit:   FY17, the TWIC program contracted a Federally Funded Research Development Center (FFRDC) to address a GAO recommendation to perform an internal control assessment .  The assessment was completed in Dec 2017 and examined the program's internal control strengths, risks, and vulnerabilities.

The TIM Program mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security. The TIM System supports operations by reducing the probability of a successful terrorist attack on the transportation system by applying threat assessment methodologies intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working in or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system.
 TIM was originally built and operated in the DHS Datacenter cloud environment. TIM is a fully integrated system utilizing service oriented architecture capable of providing more effective and efficient security threat assessments to all transportation sectors including: surface, maritime and aviation. TIM is the Security Threat Assessment infrastructure focal point for stakeholders including: Congress, FBI, State Department, Coast Guard, State & Local agencies, U.S. airports, U.S. ports, as well as transportation employers, transportation employees, and travelers.
 The TIM program’s goals are to improve customer service, provide one-stop shopping, enable a person-centric view, to implement “enroll, once and use many”, to increase the efficiency of security threat assessments and information sharing with federal, state, local authorities and industry partners, to promote secure operations, to support fee-fairness and comparability between credentials for  transportation workers, and to realize economies of scale; as well as operational efficiencies through integration of processes.
 TIM customers (transportation workers and travelers) will benefit from the efficiencies and cost avoidance once TIM is fully implemented. Workers and travelers will also experience improved service at a lower cost. TIM is poised to be an Enterprise-level solution for ScreeningCoordination Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiatives (CFI). TIM was one of the first DHS programs to use DHS Data Center Cloud Services. In FY18, TIM was migrated to enclaves in DC1 & CSOC.  TIM is a DHS agile pilot program that enables agile responses to changing business conditions and operational requirements via engineered business processes, and seamless information sharing services based on managed data (accurate, timely, trustable) with tuned IT performance.","024SO18227 - Not Available","TIM is a Performing Program.  Though not fully implemented yet, the TIM Program already eliminates redundant business practices and processes, TIM will also achieve cost and performance efficiencies by integrating now separate IT systems (TWIC, Consolidated Screening Gateway, Screening Gateway, Crew Vetting, Alien Flight Student Program) functionality under one program.  TIM enables support for external stakeholders such as Maritime, Surface, and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations.
 As demonstrated by reporting on operational performance metrics 230776 (Unit Cost of Processing ...) and 214428 (Operational Availability ...), TIM provides TSA internal benefits by enabling information sharing across TSA / DHS .  Additionally, with the implementation of the re-baseline, and the introduction of additional populations beyond Maritime, TIM will commence reporting on Operational Performance metrics 214427 (Enroll Once Use Many...), and 214431 (Security Threat Assessment Response Time...).
 The TIM system was designed to function in a cloud environment.  TIM's infrastructure will result in significant cost savings, especially in future years during the O&M phase.  These savings will be evidenced by metrics 214427, 214428, 214429 (Cases automatically processed ...), and 214430 (MTBF).  Benefits to external stakeholders include streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person-centric which will be documented by metric 214427, and 230776.
 TIM is person centric in that the system recognizes workers applying for multiple credentials, endorsemen+D88ts, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation modes.  This person-centric capability enables TSA to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities which saves users time and money.
 TIM's STA process uses biometric and biographic information to perform automated immigration, criminal history,finger print, and terrorist watch list checks.  The transportation worker must have an approved STA to start or continue work, or even to apply for a job within the US transportation infrastructure.

In FY17, FPLS helped collect over $28.6B in child support, including $3.9B in federal collections. Next to the custodial parents’ earnings, child support is the second largest income source for poor families receiving child support. Because of its nationwide breadth & scope, & the nature of the child support program, it is characterized by a unique, comprehensive partnership of federal, state & local government agencies, thousands of employers, & millions of citizens.
 
The FPLS assists states in effectively & efficiently achieving the ultimate mission of the program: providing child support to millions of our nation’s children. The FPLS also assists critical program partners – employers, financial institutions, insurers, & other federal agencies – to provide data in cost-effective & efficient ways. FPLS aligns with & supports the HHS goal to strengthen the economic & social well-being of Americans by encouraging personal responsibility and self-sufficiency, eliminating barriers to economic opportunity, & supporting strong families. FPLS enables ACF and OCSE to meet their goals & the missions of state child support programs to increase collections by facilitating communication & data exchanges with states, employers, multistate financial institutions, insurers & other federal agencies & using FPLS data to locate parents delinquent in support. Additionally, a multitude of state & federal agencies use FPLS data to recoup & prevent erroneous payments to combat fraud, waste & abuse across government benefit programs. 

This investment is comprised of multiple systems, including four that are critical to the business mission of the child support program: the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), a database of employment data; the Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders (FCR), a database of child support cases & orders; the Debtor File, which assists states with collection of delinquent child support; & the Child Support Portal (CSP), which provides authorized users a secure gateway into FPLS web applications.","009SO18206 - Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, 009SO18212 - Encourage self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, and eliminate barriers to economic opportunity, 009SO18214 - Support strong families and healthy marriage, and prepare children and youth for healthy, productive lives, 009SO18220 - Ensure responsible financial management, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals, 009SO18224 - Protect the safety and integrity of our human, physical, and digital assets","In FY17, the benefit to cost ratio for the FPLS is 172:1 or an ROI of 17,489%.  This ROI, detailed below, is calculated based on the total amount of child support collections directly attributable to the FPLS compared to every dollar invested in IT.

FPLS-ATTRIBUTABLE COLLECTIONS: In FY17 approximately $3.9B in child support collections were directly attributable to the FPLS, as follows:  $1.8B in Federal Offset collections; $1B in SSA benefit garnishment; an estimated $892M in NDNH W-4 data matching; and $171M in voluntarily reported collections from the Passport Denial, Insurance Match, & Multistate Financial Institution Data Match programs. A portion of these collections are returned to the Federal government to recover federal costs to administer social service programs.

IT SPENDING: In FY17, total IT spending was $22.5M.

ADDITIONAL FPLS BENEFITS: Although not quantified in the ROI, FPLS also provides benefits to other state and federal agencies by providing data that assists these agencies in preventing and recouping erroneous payments to combat fraud, waste and abuse across government benefit programs. These partnerships enable FPLS to support HHS goals to increase efficiency, transparency and accountability by ensuring program integrity and resource stewardship. Match partners and related benefits include:

FY2017

-       BFS used a combination of NDNH and other data to recover approximately $80.9 million in federal non-tax debt and $14.8 million in payment agreement collections.

-       Using NDNH data, HUD estimates the subsidy error for their rental assistance programs to be over $300 million.

-       Department of Labor estimated the benefits of NDNH and SDNH W-4 matching to be about $135 million identified and an estimated $188 million prevented and recovered.

-       IRS recovered almost $376M in tax debt.

FY2016

-       SSA’s DI/UI match resulted in an estimated overall benefit of over $10 million.  SSA reports that the benefit-to-cost ratio for this match is 30:1

-       Eight state TANF agencies avoided $2.0M in erroneous costs.

-       22 states participating in the NDNH-SNAP match reported avoidance of over $30M in improper payments to SNAP recipients with previously unknown earnings.

And in FY2015, SSA prevented $1B in future overpayments and adjustments of incorrect payments in the Supplemental Security Income program.

In addition, many applications and enhancements included in the FPLS investment were selected and implemented to increase automation and provide cost savings and avoidance to State Child Support Agencies. These savings ultimately result in savings to the Federal government as well by reducing FFP paid back to states for these expenditures.","The Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) is legislatively mandated by the Social Security Act, section 453, 42 U.S.C.  § 653, available at https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title04/0453.htm .  The Personal Responsibility & Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193), Title III, section 316, entitled Expansion of the Federal Parent Locator Service, expanded the FPLS; specifically, subsection 316(f) requires the Secretary of HHS to establish and maintain the Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders (FCR) and the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), primary components of the FPLS.  P.L. 104-193, subsection 316(f); codified at 42 U.S.C. § 653(h) & (i).

NAIS is a data collection, processing and distribution system that provides international Maritime Organization (IMO)-adopted Automatic Identification System (AIS) information to enhance safety of navigation and our Marine Transportation System (MTS), and improve Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The project provides the necessary capability to ensure the effective exchange of information  between AIS-equipped vessels, aircraft, ATON, and shore stations within all major U.S. ports, waterways, and coastal zones.  It integrates a network of AIS receivers and transmitters, data processing and storage centers, and user interface services that capture, exchange, and analyze data of critical interest for maritime safety and security.  Data collected supports the nation's maritime interest, from the safety of vessels and ports through collision avoidance, to the safety of the nation through detection, traffic identification, and classification of vessels.
Benefits/Stakeholders:
The data collected by NAIS will be shared with other pertinent stakeholders and decision makers in support of maritime security at critical ports.  NAIS supports a layered defense and requirements for Advanced Notice of Arrival by correlating AIS data with target vessel reporting and other maritime awareness data to focus resources on higher interest vessels.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of NAIS include: USCG, CBP, Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, indirectly to the international community through MSSIS, and port partners.  Maritime Operational Threat Response benefits in achieving a coordinated U.S. Government response to threats to the US in the maritime domain.  NAIS will facilitate the Coast Guard response to threats in the maritime domain by enabling better visibility of suspect vessels as well as other vessels in the vicinity.  NAIS will allow for visibility and tracking of U.S. Government vessel assets for improved overall coordination of resources.  Maritime Communications benefits are associated with improved USCG ability to communicate with vessels in support of various USCG missions.  These benefits include the enhanced exchange of navigation information, improved communications interoperability with foreign vessels and other Government agencies' vessels, and backup capability to the Rescue 21 voice systems via AIS messaging.  The following USCG systems are dependent upon NAIS: IOC,  WebCOP, eGIS, MISLE, and MAGNet.","024APG18014 - Enhance Southern Border Security","NAIS improves maritime domain awareness and offers improvements in collision avoidance, maritime safety, environmental protection and national security through the detection, classification and tracking of vessels whether they are in national water or still thousands of miles off shore.  
The ROI of 7.94, as calculated in the NAIS Alternatives Analysis of Dec 29, 2006, was calculated by determining the sum of the present value of all benefits and dividing it by the sum of the present value of all costs of each capability.  The benefits of security risk reduction (such as detection of large commercial vessel introduces WMD into US port and fishing vessel has a crew member onboard suspected of being a terrorist) are included in the ROI calculation.  The benefits of operational performance (such as improved Search and Rescue detection and response and collision detection and enforcement) have not been included because the confidence in those calculations was low; however if they were to be included, the ROI would be even higher.  The benefits were calculated for the following capabilities provided by NAIS: coastal receive, coastal transmit, long range receive, advanced data capability, and inland waters receive and transmit.  For each capability a variety of scenarios were evaluated using probabilities of occurrence and consequence costs to demonstrate the improvement in security risk by implementing NAIS.  
The present value of all costs of each capability was calculated using the LCCE produced as part of the NAIS Alternatives Analysis document.  The total benefit was calculated as $5,704,345,592; the total LCC was calculated as $718,062,000; the ROI was calculated as 7.94.  
While 7.94 is the ROI for the whole NAIS system, each Increment offers improvements in each capability to differing degrees.  Increment 1 primarily benefits coastal receive.  After recapitalization of Increment 1 with Increment 2, the return on investment is significant improvement of marine safety and security by increasing receive coverage from 24nm to 50 nm, the addition of transmit capability out to 24 nm, and advanced data capability.  Increment 3 primarily benefits long range receive.","NAIS derives from the U.S. obligations under Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974,  an international treaty, calls for automatic identification system of vessels; Maritime Transportation Safety Act (MTSA) Act of 2002 which is CG efforts in improving its knowledge of the ships calling at U.S. ports as “Maritime Domain Awareness” (MDA).

Key customers, stakeholder, and other beneficiaries: The agency management support function of the CAS suite is to service over 2,400 commands and field units throughout the U.S. Coast Guard and Transportation Security Agency.  The CAS suite monitors the scope of activities to be covered by accounting and financial systems.","024SO18227 - Not Available","Return on Investment: This legacy system has been deployed for over thirteen years, supporting the financial and procurement transactions for three DHS components. By this fact alone, DHS, CG and TSA leadership agree that CAS provides positive ROI, but the ROI has diminished over the years due to obsolescence and security risks. Calculating the current ROI on this legacy system would require significant time and resources.  For a system that is planned for disposition, the time and resources required to calculate the current ROI have been reallocated by leadership for continued sustainment of the system. It should be noted that the CAS Suite is planned for disposal after all data is either converted and migrated to FMSII or transferred into the planned FMPDR after the USCG and TSA successfully go live on FMSII. 
Benefits Internal (Government): A benefit of the CAS suite is that the system supports  accounting, asset management, and procurement system for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency. All financial transactions are consolidated in the CAS suite so that information can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security in a timely manner. The CAS suite records and tracks accounting and financial activities, ensuring that legislative, Government Accounting Office, Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Homeland Security requirements are captured. 
  
Benefits External (General Public):  The external benefits stems on continued service to the general public regarding support from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency.

The program acquires and implements the C4ISR capabilities mandated by the asset ORDs to improve the USCG response to emerging threats within the maritime domain. C4ISR mission needs, threats and gaps described in the 2004 Deepwater Mission Need Statement (MNS) were validated in a 2012 C4ISR MNS and remain valid. C4ISR concerns extend beyond deepwater regions to wherever USCG assets are relied upon to support the service’s enduring roles of Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship. To effectively respond to the threats facing our maritime region, the program will focuses on the following priorities: Functionality - obtain core C4ISR for air, surface, intelligence and shore; Interoperability - transition from proprietary to government to open solutions; Implementation - net-centric design, initial asset installs, upgrades and back-fits; Supportability - lab infrastructure that supports the Government’s role as system integrator and keeps pace with evolving information technology demands and changes; and Sustainment - technology development and upgrades that reduce O&M costs. Funding for this business case only includes Acquisition, Construction & Improvement (AC&I) funds provided by the C4ISR program, which is limited to the design and development of C4ISR systems for USCG assets.

This is accomplished by uniquely identifying animals, either individually or by group/lot, and recording their movements within a production chain. The Animal Disease Traceability Information System (ADTIS) [formerly NAIS] supports animal disease traceability activities related to animal identification, movements and locations where animals are managed. It is implemented by the USDA and State agencies in cooperation with industry to enable timely trace back of the movement of diseased or exposed animal. Animal disease traceability helps to ensure rapid disease containment and maximum protection of Americas animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture s (USDA) animal disease traceability framework is a cooperative effort to identify animals and to utilize movement documentation of livestock that move interstate. The ADT embraces the strengths and expertise of States, Tribes, and producers and empowers them to find and use the most effective traceability. approaches to identify animals moving interstate nationally. Moreover, this approach builds on the success of disease programs. USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has experienced successful traceability through the identification methods used in disease eradication programs. The ADTIS is the primary USDA Investment supporting the USDA traceability framework. Stakeholders are US Animal Health Association American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, State and Federal animal health officials, Accredited Veterinarians, Producers and livestock markets and National/International consumers. The ADTIS contains four major modules:  Standardized Premises Identification System (SPIS), Premises Allocator/ Repository, Animal Identification Management System (AIMS) and the Animal Tracing Processing System (ATPS).","005SO18287 - Protect agricultural health by preventing and mitigating the spread of agricultural pests and disease.","As a result of ADTIS [formerly NAIS], the Federal and State governments savings in connection with the administration of animal disease control and eradication programs are significant, but they are only part of the overall benefits. Economic benefits in both the domestic and international marketplace resulting from enhanced traceability may be greater than the cost savings realized during animal disease control and eradication efforts. For industry, the effect of not implementing some aspects of ADTIS may result in significant losses as great as $1.32 billion on average per year over a 10-year period due mostly to reduced export market access. Implementation of ADTIS becomes more cost effective as participation levels increase and actually may not be economically viable at lower participation levels. The cattle industry cost represents 91.5 percent of the total cost of ADTIS for the primary food animal species (cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry). Identification tags and tagging cattle represent 75 percent of the cattle sectors annual adoption cost. Tags and tagging costs vary among cattle producers with 50 head from $3.30 to $5.22 per cow, depending on current identification practices. The total cost for implementing ADTIS in the cattle sector as described in the study is $175.9 million annually (at a 90 percent participation level). Although significant, the cost is less than one-half of a percent of the retail value of U.S. beef products. The swine and poultry industries each have a lower cost because animal tracing requirements for these species require less infrastructure and often no individual identification devices. Traceability is becoming a global standard that will likely affect the ability of the United States to compete globally.

The purpose of the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) is to provide a national picture of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with our national, state, and local public health partners and to support the use of syndromic surveillance in order to detect and characterize disease outbreaks or other hazardous events or conditions of public health concern. 
BioSense mission is to:
Advance the science and practice of syndromic surveillance, strengthen effective governance for decision-making, develop and maintain the platform to host and provide access to syndromic surveillance applications including BioSense, analytic tools and services; and develop and maintain the BioSense application for data collection, processing, and sharing. 
 
Our goals include:
 
1.       Enhancement of current software functionality
2.       Provide additional analytic tools in the cloud
3.       Improve data quality and representativeness
Achieving these 3 goals will increase usefulness to our partners in state and local public health departments.  Additionally by providing this platform and suite of tools, we help state and local health departments assist their hospitals in achieving the Syndromic Surveillance Meaningful Use objective.  The more our state and local partners use and find value in the tools we provide, the more data and information will flow into the shared environment and the more complete our national surveillance picture will be.  A more complete surveillance picture will translate into earlier recognition of, better characterization of, and more effective response to events of public health significance.
BioSense and the NSSP are part of the CDC surveillance strategy.  Supporting and accomplishing this work will directly affect achievement of the newly described strategy.  Our key stakeholders include CDC leadership, CDC programs, State Health Departments, City and County Health Departments, and local hospitals.  Providing access to shared analytic tools and services for public health programs and practioners will allow analysis and sharing of disease patterns when needed to identify, investigate, and monitor public health threats that cross municipal jurisdictions.","009SO18216 - Improve surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory services","The key aim of BioSense is to provide federal, state, and local public health officials with the data, information, and tools they need to better prepare for and coordinate public health responses, and safeguard and improve the health of the American people.  BioSense contributes to a nationwide and regional (i.e., multi-state) situational awareness for all hazards health-related events (beyond bioterrorism).   The BioSense Program is improving its utility for state and local users, and thereby integrating local and state-level data into a cohesive “picture” for the nation.  This is consistent with the 2006 Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), and 2007 Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-21), both of which call for regional and nationwide public health situational awareness, through enabling state and local situational awareness capability.  Although the original goal of syndromic surveillance was rapid outbreak detection, most public health professionals now find this surveillance approach to provide considerable value for situational awareness, or monitoring and projecting changes in population health.  
   
Successful implementation of BioSense promotes a national situational awareness picture that provides the following outcomes:  
 
•          Greater partner communication and collaboration  
•          Greater data sharing  
•          Greater access to more comprehensive information (regional/national views)  
•          Greater use of BioSense to detect outbreaks and inform investigations  
   
Additionally, the use of the cloud and shared tools and services has reduced costs both for CDC and our state and local partners.","To support national emergency preparedness, the U.S. Congress passed legislation and appropriated funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish an integrated national public health surveillance system for early detection and rapid assessment of bioterrorism-related events. To meet this need, CDC launched BioSense in 2003. Since 2011, the focus has expanded to situational awareness for all-hazards preparedness and response. The NSSP provides syndromic surveillance practitioners access to and use of the cloud-based BioSense Platform, a secure integrated electronic health information system with standardized analytic tools and processes.

It incorporates interoperable subsystems, components, system modules, and applications developed and implemented by CDC, state and local health departments, and commercial vendors. It also establishes required policy-level agreements on data collection, dissemination, and access in accordance with local, state and federal regulations to ensure protection of confidential information and represents ongoing collaboration between CDC and its public health partners. 
 
In 2001, no state had integrated public health surveillance systems; today the public health jurisdictions have implemented systems based on NEDSS vision. Coordinated initiatives provided an array of standards-based systems and supporting technologies such as Public Health Information Network (PHIN), NEDSS Base System (NBS), and Message Validation Processing and Provisioning System (MVPS). With the evolution of technology, data and exchange standards, CDC now has the opportunity to strengthen and modernize its infrastructure. As part of the CDC Surveillance Strategy, NNDSS Modernization Initiative (NMI) is underway to enhance the system’s ability to provide more comprehensive, timely, and higher quality data than ever before for public health decision making. The realization of the investment is best illustrated by improved processes, systems, and infrastructure enabling nation’s public health authorities to identify, monitor, and investigate diseases of public health importance. NMI has 3 key components: 1) development of standards-based messages for submission of nationally notifiable disease data sent by health jurisdictions to CDC;2) development of software to validate, process and provision the data to CDC programs; 3) technical assistance for health jurisdictions implementing the messages. This multi-year initiative, will increase robustness of technology infrastructure so that it is based on interoperable, standardized data and exchange mechanisms.

The system helps CMS determine appropriate payment of covered drugs. DDPS provides for processing, storing, and maintaining drug transaction data in a large-scale database, while putting data into data marts to support payment analysis. Medicare obtains a specific set of Part D claims data consisting of 30 data elements from all drug claims. The Prescription Drug Event (PDE) records are submitted electronically to CMS on a monthly basis, validated, and stored in a Drug Claims Data repository.

The investment secures the resources needed to operate and maintain these systems within FISMA compliance and within CMS requirements.  Resources are allocated to maintain and update, test and monitor the operation of the systems that support the Drug Data Payment System, as well as provide related audit and compliance support, program management support and customer service to relevant stakeholders.","009SO18220 - Ensure responsible financial management, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The DDPS performs validation and authentication of the drug event data in an operational database, as well as the extraction and loading of DDPS-related data into the Integrated Data Repository (IDR). It supports fraud, waste, and abuse analysis; drug utilization analysis; auditing; trends analysis; payment reconciliation; benefit adjustment analysis; and general Prescription Drug Event (PDE) reporting.

 

The PRS reconciles payments made to the Part D sponsors in the areas of Low Income Cost Sharing (LICS), Federal Reinsurance and Risk Sharing/Risk Corridors (when paired with prospective payments and actual claims data).

 

It was determined through analysis that with the expected growth rate in beneficiary count, the number of PDEs processed annually will continue to grow at a rate of nearly 10% per year, from 2.52 billion PDEs in 2016 to an estimated 3.68 billion PDEs in the year 2020. It is estimated that in 4.5 to 5 years DDPS could be overwhelmed, having to process for more than 20 hours in order to complete the estimated 11.5 million PDEs per day load. The migration of DDPS core processes onto Amazon Web Services (AWS) would modernize processing efficiency and utilize new technologies that will increase processing throughput and robust beneficiary-level editing.  In August 2017, a proof of concept was conducted in AWS to ascertain the potential gains and ROI in terms of storage space, processing time, and risk mitigation.

 

The savings of 323 GB of storage space required for this amount of data was also significant. The mainframe data storage for the DDPS PDE data is over 882 GB. On AWS, using only the default compression settings, the data required only 559 GB.

·         Lower-cost storage, along with lower storage requirements.

·         Lower technology costs (only pay when processing).

·         Lowered risk of system downtime due to server redundancy.

·         The anticipated savings of 2.3 hours of processing per day allows more mainframe bandwidth availability for other CMS contracts.

Migration to the AWS hosting environment will enable DDPS and to more efficiently process all Medicare covered and non-covered prescription drug events (PDEs) and related data, including non-Medicare drug events as necessary to validate/authenticate Medicare payment of covered drugs made by plans for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part D by end of 2020.","Part D payment is outlined in Section 1860D-15 of the Social Security Act (https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1860D-15.htm) .

CMS implementation of HIGLAS was a strategic effort that resulted in improvements in the Agency’s systems for accounting, financial management, and internal controls.  The HIGLAS initiative accomplished:
-        The establishment of an integrated general ledger accounting system that incorporated the financial data of every Medicare contractor into CMS’ own financial system.
-        The replacement of CMS’ own internal accounting system of record, the Financial Accounting Control System (FACS).

HIGLAS is a critical application enabling CMS to manage its business operations. All of CMS’ core program dollars are accounted for in HIGLAS.  It is the largest Oracle Federal Financials System based on the 4.5 million daily average Medicare claims and the payments equating to $1.46 trillion in gross outlays in FY2017 alone.  HIGLAS continues to enhance CMS’ oversight of all financial operations, in order to achieve accurate, reliable, and timely financial accounting and reporting for all of CMS’ programs and activities.","009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The HIGLAS effort has improved significantly the ability of CMS/HHS to perform Medicare accounting transactions. Some of these improvements include reduced costs due to elimination of redundant individual Medicare financial record systems, improvements in automated Medicare debt collection/referral activities, creation of audit trails for every Medicare transaction/payment/claim in HIGLAS, improved Medicare financial audit ability, and improved capability for CMS to more systematically and efficiently recover identified Medicare overpayments. Moreover, CMS now has better internal financial controls across Medicare contractor operations. Maintaining a state-of-the-art financial system like HIGLAS has a significant and positive impact on the amount of additional interest earned (saved) in the Medicare Trust Funds. Internal CMS analysis has shown that Medicare contractors transitioned to HIGLAS are collecting monies quicker than in a pre-HIGLAS environment. This is a direct result of efficiencies gained in the process of offsetting or “netting” receivables that are owed by Medicare providers to the government. In addition, HIGLAS supports the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) operated by Treasury by offsetting payments. Through August 10, 2018 CMS has recouped $612.83 million in Federal Tax debts and $269.17 million in Non-Tax debts from Medicare Provider Payments under the FPLP.","Requirements for HIGLAS include the following: 
- Support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA) requiring each Federal agency to implement and maintain financial management systems that are substantially in compliance with Federal financial management systems requirements, Federal accounting standards, and the United States Standard General Ledger at the transaction level.  HIGLAS was a critical success factor in ensuring HHS met FFMIA compliance requirements.
- Retention of a clean audit opinion for CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services
- Compliance with the requirements of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP), the Clinger-Cohen Act, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act and OMB Circulars A-127 and A-130.

The CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation and often is used to evaluate the effectiveness of government economic policy. It provides information about price changes in the Nation's economy to government, business, labor, and private citizens and is used as a guide to making economic decisions. In addition, the President, Congress, and the Federal Reserve use trends in the CPI to aid in formulating fiscal and monetary policies. 

The purpose of the investment is to operate and maintain the CPI computing systems that support the program's areas of functionality: index methodology and sampling, data collection, price data review, and price index calculation for publication. It is the investment's goal to produce and improve the quality of measures of consumer price change and simplify survey and system processes. CPI Maintenance benefits the public by effectively and efficiently maintaining and operating its system on supported software in a secure environment, ensuring the PFEI is produced on time and confidential data are not at risk of unauthorized release. By providing IT that enables the program to produce accurate, objective, relevant, timely, and accessible consumer price statistics, the CPI Maintenance investment aligns with DOL Strategic Objective 1.4: Provide timely, accurate, and relevant information on labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy. 

The key customer of CPI Maintenance is the CPI program whose stakeholders and beneficiaries include the U.S. public, government entities (such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Social Security Administration, and the Federal Reserve), private businesses, and labor unions. The CPI is used for economic analysis, policy formulation, and by individuals and organizations to escalate contract costs. The index also has a major impact on the Federal Government's finances because it is used to adjust payments to Social Security recipients, Federal and military retirees, and for other entitlement programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) and school lunches. It is used to adjust individual income tax brackets and personal exemptions for changes due to inflation.","012SO18065 - Provide timely, accurate, and relevant information on labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy.","The origination of the CPI Maintenance investment predates the existing SDLCM Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA). However, the most recent CBA reflects that the benefits of the current operation and maintenance of the CPI Maintenance investment exceed the costs for achieving the objectives of the CPI investment. In addition to the highest ROI of 481.5%, the current operation and maintenance of the CPI investment presented the least risk and the lowest adjusted life cycle costs. This investment uses a collaboration of government FTEs and contract personnel to effectively, efficiently, and continually operate and maintain the CPI System to meet its cost, schedule, and performance goals. In addition, the selected alternative is the most beneficial to CPI in terms of risk, employee relations, and quality. Risk-wise, it will remain stable through employee turnover and reactive to changes in needed technical expertise. It will maintain the current positive outlook for employees. CPI products will also continue to be high quality and strike a balance between conformance to specifications and fitness for use.    

The CPI disseminates monthly data on changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. The CPI measure is used extensively for economic analysis and policy formulation in both the public and private sectors, including use as a benchmark to escalate contract costs among individuals and organizations. The CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation in the country with over 1.3 million unique website page-views per year. The CPI is used as a deflator of other economic series such as retail sales, hourly and weekly earnings, and components of the National Income and Product Accounts including Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Over 2 million workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements which tie wage adjustments to the CPI. The index affects the income of tens of millions of American citizens as a result of statutory action: nearly 62 million Social Security beneficiaries, approximately 5 million military and Federal Civil Service retirees and survivors, and about 43 million Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients. The CPI also is used to adjust individual income tax brackets and personal income tax exemptions for changes due to inflation. Failure to fund this investment when no viable alternative is available will prevent the CPI program from providing critical outputs needed by these stakeholders that result in billions of dollars being adjusted annually.  

CPI Maintenance benefits the CPI program by effectively and efficiently maintaining and operating its system on supported software in a secure environment, ensuring a 99.5% application availability to support program operations towards completion of planned monthly releases on time.

System (HETS) is a mission critical system for CMS. HETS is an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) application that enables Medicare providers, suppliers and their authorized representatives to request Medicare beneficiary eligibility data and receive a response in real-time mode for the purposes of preparing an accurate Medicare claim, determining beneficiary liability, or determining beneficiary eligibility for specific services.

The Medicare program is a Federal health insurance program administered by CMS providing health care coverage for US citizens and their dependents aged 65 or older, disabled, and those with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). As part of its role as a provider of health care coverage, CMS is required to provide beneficiary eligibility information to health care providers using the HIPAA standards and the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare/Committee on Operating Rules for Information Exchange (CAQH/CORE). CMS developed HETS in 2004 in order to meet the HIPAA requirements.

The HETS 270/271 application is built based on the core requirements of an ASC Xl2 270/271
EDI HIPAA-compliant eligibility inquiry system. HETS provides a real-time methodology to accept eligibility inquiries (known as 270 transactions) and provide appropriate and timely
responses (known as 271 transactions) to authorized submitters. 

The purpose of the HETS 270/271 Eligibility Inquiry Transaction system is to allow Medicare
providers and their authorized representatives to submit eligibility requests and receive responses via HIPAA-compliant Xl2N 270/271 transactions. Authorized representatives include Trading Partners such as clearinghouses and third party vendors, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), and the Veteran's Administration (VA). The information in the HETS 271 responses includes data on Part A and Part B eligibility, deductibles, coinsurance, preventiveservices, and benefit utilization; Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D (Drug Plan) enrollment.

MAS provides a unified case tracking system that facilitates maintenance and transfer of case specific data with regard to fee-for-service and managed care appeals throughout the four levels of the appeals process, i.e., Level 1 appeals: affiliated contractors, Level 2 appeals: QICs, Level 3 appeals: ALJs, and Level 4 appeals: the DAB. Starting in 2014, the CMS MAS team worked with the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA) to develop an interface between MAS and OMHA's new Electronic Case Processing System (ECAPE).  In 2015 and 2016 the MAS team delivered interface capability in the form of web services to transfer appeals between MAS and ECAPE.  

In addition to basic case tracking across all levels of Medicare appeals in a unified system, MAS provides the capability to report on appeals data, enable more accurate and expedient responses to Congressional questions, and provide more precise data for assessment and policy-setting. MAS fulfills these business needs by focusing on data collection, data analysis, and workflow management. MAS is capable of docketing/calendaring hearings, scheduling expert witnesses for testimony, and providing information on the Medicare appeals workload as it relates to the number of ALJs and support staff required to process appeals. Moreover, MAS envisions a future environment in which all of the management of the appeal files will be handled electronically. Specifically, the ALJ would have electronic access to all necessary documents, prior decisions, and other relevant information. MAS also supports fraud and abuse efforts because it now provides appeals outcomes and statistics to the Recovery Audit Contractors.","009APG18080 - Combined Data Analyses, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals, 009SO18224 - Protect the safety and integrity of our human, physical, and digital assets","The Medicare Appeals System (MAS) is a system that tracks and records Medicare appeals through multiple levels of the appeal process.  MAS was developed to support legislatively mandated appeals processes for traditional Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Managed Care items and services.  In addition, MAS is required to support judicially mandated notice and appeal procedures resulting from Grijalva v. Shalala.  

MAS is a system that tracks and records Medicare appeals through multiple levels of the appeal process.  The system leverages processes and consolidates data to allow users across levels to realize benefits of reusable, centralized data.  The system supports standard processing of appeals and availability of data to other levels while allowing stakeholders and user groups to shape procedures at their desired level.  Currently, MAS supports Levels 1, 2, and 3 appeals processing.  Level I appeals pertains to Part A Redeterminations of Fee-for-Service appeals by MACs and reopenings (clerical and non-clerical). Level II appeals pertains to reconsiderations of Fee-for-Service appeals by QICs, reconsiderations of Managed Care appeals by IRE, reconsiderations of Part D Prescription Drug Plan appeals by Part D QICs and reopenings (clerical and non-clerical).  Level III appeals pertains to hearing requests by ALJs of all Level 3 appeals by the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA).  

MAS supports unified case tracking to facilitate the maintenance and transfer of case-specific data for fee-for-service, managed care, and drug appeals.  In addition, MAS provides the capability to report on appeals data, enable more accurate and expedient responses to Congressional questions, and provides more precise data for assessment and policy-setting. MAS fulfills these business needs by focusing on data collection, case management tracking, data storage and analysis, reporting, electronic document management, and workflow management.

As the central e-government system for managing the day-to-day operations of these programs, HPMS ensures that there is a single mechanism by which plans and CMS can communicate electronically in a secure and efficient manner. HPMS is critical to CMS in managing over 830 MA and PDP organizations to ensure that they are fulfilling their statutory, regulatory, and administrative requirements. The HPMS investment aligns with the four primary CMS strategic goals. In support of “Empowering Patients and Doctors to make Decisions about their healthcare,” HPMS collects and disseminates MA and Part D plan data to beneficiaries, doctors, and all external parties via the data displayed in the Medicare & You Handbook, the Medicare Plan Finder website, and the cms.gov website.  This data allows users to review and compare MA and Part D plans. The “Increasing State Flexibility and Local Leadership” goal is supported by having state users directly access HPMS to review and approve state-specific data.  This is especially true for the Medicare-Medicaid Programs and the Program for All-Inclusive Care of the Elderly program, as state review, approval, and oversight is integral to their success. The HPMS investment also supports the “Developing Innovative Approaches to Improving Quality, Accessibility and Affordability” objective. HPMS supports 3 program models from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation: the Value-Based Insurance Design, the Enhanced MTM program, and the QPP Program.  These models aim to innovate the Medicare program, while providing improved health outcomes and reducing costs to beneficiaries and the federal government. Lastly, HPMS supports the agency’s “Improving the CMS Customer Experience” strategic goal. HPMS contributes to this strategic goal through conducting annual customer satisfaction surveys, providing lessons learned feedback periods, and providing new ways for both internal and external users to submit and access data (e.g., using an API).","009SO18204 - Promote affordable healthcare, while balancing spending on premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs, 009SO18205 - Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition","DPD closely manages the planned lifecycle costs.  Costs are tracked on a monthly basis with each HPMS contractor identifying whether projects are within budget and on schedule.  DPD receives weekly and monthly reports regarding cost and schedule.  In addition, DPD meets weekly with each HPMS contractor to discuss cost, schedule, risks, and priorities.  In addition to tracking current costs and priorities closely to ensure that the investment remains on budget, DPD tracks lifecycle costs by breaking out steady-state costs vs. enhancement costs.  Because DPD vigorously monitors cost and schedule in conjunction with our contractors, the HPMS investment has consistently met our goals as defined by established cost and schedule baselines.  Where there have been cost or schedule variances over the life of the project, they have been minimal in nature, and DPD has been able to mitigate the issue through early intervention and development of an action plan that has been agreed upon by DPD, the contractor, and the HPMS business owner. 

 

The performance measures identified directly relate to the HPMS planned outcomes and benefits, with many metrics focusing on user satisfaction.  The satisfaction survey performance metric directly relates to both internal and external end users having a positive experience with the HPMS system.  The contract approval and bid approval performance metrics are vital to disseminate accurate information to downstream systems, including providing beneficiaries access to appropriate plans and benefits during the annual election period.  Additionally, ensuring that 95% of help desk inquiries are resolved within 24 hours and continuous system availability provide users with a reliable system with any issues/questions addressed timely.

 
Overall, the HPMS investment is meeting its performance goals and should remain in operations and maintenance.  The system serves a vital role in the ongoing operations of the MA and Part D programs, supporting the full lifecycle of the plan enrollment and plan compliance business functions.  In consideration of the feedback provided by users via the customer satisfaction survey, DPD will focus on improving the HPMS user interface for a better user experience, improving system availability for both internal and external users, adding greater flexibility to user access, supporting bulk downloads and uploads for large datasets, improving search capabilities, improving communications from CMS, working with OIT on the EUA password management process, and provide more customized training opportunities.","The HPMS investment is legislatively mandated and corresponds to 42 CFR Parts. 417 422 423 and 480.

These capabilities have been leveraged and integrated to expand the capabilities to inbound pedestrian, outbound vehicle and pedestrian, and U.S. Border Patrol (BP) checkpoint processing; and improve existing primary processing operations. LBI’s goals are to facilitate the flow of travelers into the U.S. in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to Secure and Manage Flows of People and Goods while minimizing disruption and facilitating safe and secure inbound and outbound legal flows of people and goods; increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of land border processing; and integrate data to support intelligence and targeting within the Land Border “Triangle”: inbound, checkpoint, and outbound. Benefits include: vehicle (20%) and pedestrian (35%) inspection processing faster than standard processing without LBI technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes; reduced manual license plate corrections and fewer time and labor intensive secondary referrals. The reduced number of acceptable documents, and increased document security features make it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents.  LBI extended benefits from initial inbound vehicle capabilities by ensuring that vehicle and document data can also be acquired when vehicles leave the U.S. (outbound) or travel within the U.S. interior (U.S. Border Patrol checkpoints).  LBI has also extended these benefits to travelers entering the U.S. on foot (pedestrians) and buses. Key LBI customers include CBP officers, U.S. Border Patrol agents, and the traveling public.

For inbound vehicle and pedestrian processing, RFID technologies, upgraded LPRs, an improved primary inspection application, direction variable message signage, traffic management devices, and policies like active lane management (ALM) expedite border crossing, more efficiently use scarce officer and infrastructure resources.  For example, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options result in more efficient processing methods: vehicles (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without the RFID technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes.  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The benefits that accrue from the technical facilitation (RFID, LPR, VPC) of the crossing process are far reaching: increased throughput per officer, reduced border crossing wait time, and increased capacity to accommodate increases in border crossing volume.  Increased border crossing volume has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.  These capabilities also provide more enhanced information about travelers which improves border crossing security.  LBI ‘returns’ are calculated based on the difference in wait time prior to LBI compared to post LBI, and by estimating the value of that time for the traveling public.

The 3 phase implementation of SAP was completed in October of 2004. This effort was undertaken as a result of an analysis of legacy Customs Asset Management Processes and replaced numerous legacy financial, procurement, and property systems with a single, fully integrated solution.  The investment’s goals are to provide managerial and mission support benefits to CBP including: complete integration of business processes within one system, improved financial statement reporting and internal controls, reduced cycle-time, elimination of duplicate data entry, improved data accuracy, single system reporting, and enhanced analytical reporting.  SAP supports QHSR Mission 2; Secure and Manage our Borders.  SAP’s benefits and contribution to mission delivery ensures that CBP is in compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems. Additionally SAP provides the financial data, procurement of mission supplies, and asset tracking and reporting which allows front line offices to accomplish their mission.  The SAP approach reduces functional gaps identified in past audits and raises performance to acceptable industry benchmarks.  The SAP Program is in a steady - state mode under the Investment Management Process. CBP is now state-of-the-art and has been identified as a leader in Financial Management by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The SAP system must be maintained and supported so that CBP financial staff can meet their timelines and efficiency targets which help CBP to operate effectively.  Maintaining SAP will also help CBP continue receiving unqualified audit opinions.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of the system include the over 7,500 CBP field and headquarters role-based users as well as CBP and DHS management who utilize the data and information processed and reported onin SAP. Other stakeholders for the SAP program include the Office of Finance and the Office of Information Technology as co-sponsors of the program; as well as others who rely on accurate financial data from CBP.","024SO18227 - Not Available","SAP is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that replaced ten stove-piped, outdated, and underperforming mainframe systems that resulted in audit findings of significant internal control weaknesses and were deemed insufficient and no longer suited to meeting data processing and reporting needs.  SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  
Total cost to support the operations and maintenance of the SAP system are approximately $20M annually.  These costs include government FTE, contractor support, software license agreements, and miscellaneous equipment and training.
As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.  The elimination of duplicate entry manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  The Strategic and Business/Mission Analysis shows the many benefits SAP provides to CBP/DHS including:  complete integration of business processes within one system; improved financial statement reporting and internal controls; reduced cycle-time; elimination of duplicate entry; improved data accuracy; single system reporting; enhanced analytical reporting; and compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems.
The SAP program reports performance annually via the Operational Analysis (OA) covering the following areas:  Customer Results, Strategic and Business results, Financial Performance, Innovation, Performance Measure Results, and Risk Assessment.  Summary results are reported on the OA tab of this form.  The program reports on five metrics in the INVEST system via the monthly reporting form.  Based on the Office of Finance Customer Satisfaction Surveys in FY2018 the SAP Overall Average Satisfaction Rating remained consistently high at 3.94 out of a possible 5.0 across all survey components.  The Technical Performance Analysis of SAP shows the system planned availability is above 99% for the 2018 fiscal year to date, indicating little to no unplanned downtime for the SAP production server.  The team remains committed to primary stakeholders with Strategic and Business engagement at least once a quarter.  Help desk performance remains high and the level I help desk are on target to meet the 72% resolution rate resulting in a quick resolution for SAP users to their inquiries.  And inquiries of all types to the help desk including phone calls, and emails will be resolved in an average of under 4 hours for the coming fiscal year.
SAP continues to be a good investment for CBP and the federal government and critical in managing CBPs Budget, Revenue, and Asset Management processes.  Most recently published Performance and Accountability Report for FY2016 include $19 billion in budgetary resources, $44 billion in revenue, and $16 billion in assets.

 In May 2014, President Obama signed the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) (P.L. 113-101) into law. Now implemented within the SAP system, the DATA Act makes Federal spending data more accessible, searchable, and reliable. It not only makes it easier to understand how the Federal government spends taxpayer dollars but also serves as a tool for better oversight, data-centric decision-making, and innovation both inside and outside of government. This was accomplished by standardization of the short text data field in SAP. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) lead the government-wide implementation of the DATA Act.  The DATA Act project was completed and implemented at CBP in October 2016.  For more information on the DATA Act follow this link:  https://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/data-model/
The third mandate was for the Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID).  To satisfy this requirement the SAP team updated the structure of the contract and PO number in the SAP system which has resulted in each PIID used to identify a solicitation or contract action being unique Government-wide.  This will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of the contract award as required.  This project was completed and implemented at CBP in late FY2017.  Additional information on this mandate can be found in the FARin Subpart 4.16 sections (4.1601, 4.1602, 4.1603) https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/pdf/FAR.pdf.

As stated in the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Executive Summary-Secure and Manage our Borders, “We must continue to improve upon border security”–Tactical voice communication capabilities are fundamental tools that enable coordinated activities in campus and remote environments to secure U.S. borders against illegal entry of people and goods while managing legitimate travel and trade. Investment goals–provide critical land mobile radio communication coverage; provide Advanced Encryption Standard; provide federal, state, local, tribal, territory, private sector, international law enforcement interoperability capabilities complying with NTIA P-25 mandates; modernize, replace unsupported, antiquated communication equipment. TACCOM benefits include enhanced mission safety for officers/agents protecting the U.S.–enhance coverage in previously deficient coverage areas–officer/agent radios are their lifelines; NTIA interoperability compliance to enable multi-stakeholder critical situation communications; encrypted communication to prevent criminal element listening, stealing, sensitive voice traffic; upgraded digital communication equipment requiring maintenance less often, reducing operational cost; and ultimately U.S. citizen protection from terrorist threat. TACCOM supports the DHS mission–Secure and Manage Our Borders. Key customers and stakeholders include over 46,000 agents and officers from CBP operational component organizations: U.S. Border Patrol, the Office of Field Operations, and Air and Marine Operations. Other beneficiaries include the U. S. public; federal agencies such as the Department of Interior; Department of Agriculture; Drug Enforcement Administration; Federal Bureau of Investigation; Department of Transportation; interagency partners like U.S. Coast Guard; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and partnerships with state, local, tribal, territory, private sector, international law enforcement agencies to share information and conduct coordinated/integrated operations.","024APG18014 - Enhance Southern Border Security","The TACCOM PMO developed an Analysis of Alternatives that included a Return on Investment (ROI) analysis used to calculate the most cost effective modernization and implementation strategy that met all Program Office requirements. The detailed analysis included developing Life Cycle Cost Estimates (LCCEs) for the three viable communication alternatives to compare to the Status Quo/Legacy Land Mobile Radio System (LMR) to conduct a financial analysis; 1) Conventional Vote Scan 2) Trunked, and 3) Simulcast. The financial analysis included ROI, Net Present Value, and Payback Period for each alternative using the Status Quo/Legacy LMR System as the baseline. Tools used to support analysis were Crystal Ball (for Monte Carlo simulations), the Automated Cost Estimating Integrated Tools Cost Estimating Relationship Library Tool, and MS Excel. The preferred alternative was, and remains, the conventional vote scan system because it possessed the lowest primary cost attribute in acquisition, and secondly, has the highest return on investment (ROI) and the lowest payback period. Cost avoidance and savings are applied through efficient acquisition processes to include more efficient LMR maintenance agreements, and the implementation of advanced technology communication equipment, where possible, that provides lower long-term maintenance cost. The LMR system and communications capabilities are critical to U.S. border protection and ensuring CBP law enforcement safety and security, and though advanced technology affords maintenance savings, that technology is increasing in cost. TACCOM ROI is best described in qualitative terms through improved reliability, performance and other and benefits provided. The current and future government benefits are: 1) Improved communication capability for border protection and agent safety; 2) Improved operational availability (>90%)/reliability/maintainability (refreshing/updating obsolete equipment); 3) Increased system coverage (innovative technology/increased remote communications capabilities/more RF tower locations); 4) Increased network capacity (improved compliance with NTIA narrowband mandate, provides foundation for future data/video capability); 5) Increased security (advanced Encryption Standard (AES)); 6) Improved situational awareness (faster incident response); 7) Better interoperability (implementation of P25 standard enabling multi-agency communication capabilities). Externally, these benefits provide same-technology-level tactical communications between government law enforcement/emergency management and external partners, as many external partners currently employ (or plan to) modernized communication capabilities. This leads to faster incident/emergency response times that enable efficient dissemination of information to external government organizations, improved coordination between federal, state/province and local public safety agencies, increased government transparency and accountability. Externally, these benefits provide the ultimate benefit to U.S. citizens through increased citizen safety/border protection.","The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act earmarked $60M for the modernization of Tactical Communications equipment at CBP. In addition, $10M in Border Security supplemental funds were dedicated to CBP Tactical Communications - http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/recovery/CBP_Tactical_Communications_Modernization_Program_2009-05-15.pdf. TACCOM directly supports and continues to adhere to basic homeland security mission “Secure and Manage Our Borders” as revised in the 2014 QHSR. CBP is responsible for securing the nation’s borders against illegal entry of people and goods while facilitating legitimate travel and trade. To support this mission, CBP operates and maintains one of the largest Land Mobile Radio (LMR) tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal government. Tactical communications capabilities are essential to coordinating mission activities and protecting the safety of over 46,000 CBP law enforcement agents and officers. Agents and officers operate in remote areas where their radio is often their only communications channel to coordinate activities or summon assistance. By improving coverage, capacity, reliability, and encryption, the modernization effort provides critical communications support to the agents and officers who secure U.S. borders - http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2014-qhsr-final-508.pdf. TACCOM upgrades LMR to P25: DHS 4300A requires that LMR systems comply with P25 security standards. P25 primary objectives promote interoperability among digital/analog LMR equipment used by various levels of Government, support backward compatibility with legacy LMRs, enhance spectrum efficiency, maximize economies of scale.

The investment maintains familiar and essential IT tools that enable ORA to adapt to new requirements from legislation and growing business needs.

GOALS - SIRCE supports FDA Strategic Goal 1: Enhance Oversight of FDA-Regulated Products Objective 1.2: Reduce risks in the manufacturing, production and distribution of FDA-regulated products; Objective 1.3: Strengthening detection and surveillance of problems with FDA-regulated product; Objective 1.4: Improve Response to identified and emerging problems with FDA-regulated products; Goal 4: Strengthen Organizational Excellence and Accountability Objective 4.2: Improve the overall operation and effectiveness of FDA. 

Near-term goals focus on maintaining and enhancing existing systems and adding new tools to support mission achievement. Existing systems have long been essential to ORA’s enforcement of regulations related to imported and domestic products and to sharing food and drug product information with other health safety organizations. Planned new functions enhance existing systems for risk-based decision making; remote access for facility inspections; and data sharing with Federal, state and local agencies.

CURRENT/ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: SIRCE enables ORA to effectively increase public health and improve workforce productivity. SIRCE benefits the public by enabling risk-based inspections and import screens that ensure medical product safety and the farm-to-table safety of the food supply. SIRCE expanding ability to share data with other public health organizations improves the nation’s ability to detect, identify, and respond to health emergencies. SIRCE’s internalbenefits include improved user interface, data management, and communication systems that increase productivity and enable ORA staff to spend more time on their important public safety duties.

KEY CUSTOMERS/STAKEHOLDERS: Approximately 6,600 people in nearly all FDA business units and over 600 state users benefit from the SIRCE systems. The business community and, ultimately, the public, are also key stakeholders benefiting from efficient FDA processes and reduced public health risk.","009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The first benefit for an enhanced SIRCE set of applications is the resulting cost avoidance by the ORA staff being more efficient in executing their tasks. This results in each employee able to carry out more inspections, etc. Examples of this are: 
1.Reduced time spent on recall removals and corrections, and enforcement reports. 
2. Improvements in executing compliance actions and work activities. 
3. Reduced time spent on inspection/investigation administrative tasks with the advent of eNSpect.
The cost avoidance of these benefits is estimated to be $2.724M per year.
The second benefit to increase the industry/trade participants staff efficiency by $2.361 per year.

A third benefit for cost avoidance is based on the value of a human life estimated at $7M. This benefit assumes that to save 5 lives per year in the United States from improved inspections, there must be continually improved systems. An argument could be made that this number should be much higher since just one outbreak of disease or drug reaction could take far more many lives.
Qualitatively, SIRCE enables ORA to effectively increase public health and improve workforce productivity. SIRCE benefits the public by enabling risk-based inspections and import screens that ensure medical product safety and the farm-to-table safety of the food supply. SIRCE expanding ability to share data with other public health organizations improves the nation’s ability to detect, identify, and respond to health emergencies. SIRCE’s internal benefits include improved user interface, data management, and communication systems that increase productivity and enable ORA staff to spend more time on their important public safety duties.","The Bioterrorism Act (BTA) of 2002 in Section 307 requires prior notice for imported food shipments. The BTA and subsequent regulations require that FDA process such food shipments with prior notice (801(m) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) on a 24x7 basis. FDA is required to provide support for this processing 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This has resulted in technical solutions to support this requirement, which is not typical of FDA systems. The Food Safety and Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011 includes Section 110 Building Domestic Capacity. This requires a technical solution for interfacing with external partners.

ATS is a web-based enforcement and decision support tool that uses intelligence info and technology to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for exams and passengers for inspection. ATS allows CBP officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers consistent with current threats. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of passengers, imports and/or exports in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subject to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analyses, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS goals are to serve the DHS Mission of Secure and Manage our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public. ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts continue to provide significant benefit to the public. ATS provides selectivity and target capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. As volumes of data increase in people, cargo, and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to more relevant real-time info on which to base critical admission decisions.  The ATS systems address data quality improvements to ensure efforts are focused on only those persons and cargo that present most probable threats to the homeland.  The beneficiaries and key customers of ATS are: CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP Office of International Trade, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Transportation Security Administration, and theUnited States Public. Stakeholders include: DHS/CBP (OFO and OIT). ATS utilizes information received from TECS, APIS, and other systems identified in the Enterprise Architecture tab. ATS analyzes over 17M transactions per day for potential threats.  Total ATS passengers and cargo systems maintain 99% uptimes.  Additionally, ATS scans over 150 million Air, Ocean, Rail, Truck, and Auto shipments for potential threats.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The ROI cannot be calculated because the AoA/AA was not required when the ATS-M investment was developed and deployed.  However, ATS continues to provide a significant ROI by streamlining the processing of passengers and cargo while increasing the likelihood of identifying threats to the Homeland (e.g., narcotics or weapons). ATS has been operational since 2005. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo. Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts. 
 Another benefit from ATS is that users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland.  In some instances, via Visa Pre-Adjudication, passengers are vetted and denied visas prior to attempting to board an aircraft.  This reduces the workload for TSA screeners by reducing the number of potential threats screened because they are previously vetted.  This again saves critical time and money and provides a significant value to the security of our nation.
 ATS provides significant benefits through various applications and models. One example is the Air Express Intellectual Property Rights model within ATS which has captured over $188M of goods in FY17. From October 2017- June 2018 over 601,000,000 shipments were scored for targeting purposes. This far exceeded the FY target goal.  These are only a few examples of the multiple models in production within ATS.     ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public. ATS helps secure lawful trade and travel which is vital for national security and public safety.  Governmentally, ATS utilizes system engineering techniques to maintain a system of systems capability throughout its components. ATS provides stakeholders valuable information to target and capture potential threats. ATS is used as a source system to target threats and provide the useful information to boots on the ground teams that can then make an informed decision on a passenger or cargo event. Users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland.  The 0.00 value in the table below is per DHS guidance as ATS does not have an AoA, which would contain the ROI.","ATS aligns with the QHSR goals: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security and Secure and Manage Our Borders.  ATS provides critical targeting capabilities that allow targeters in the field to evaluate threats at a much faster rate and interdict when applicable.  This provides additional security and prevention of potential terrorist activity at the border and ports of entry.  ATS’s predictive models deliver machine learning and faster analysis of critical intelligence information.  Additionally, passenger and cargo targeting efforts have been augmented with several name matching algorithms that reduce the number of false positives. This also reduces the amount of time for vetting thus saving analysts’ time and allowing them to focus efforts on more critical threats.  This helps to better secure the US borders.

ACE delivers these capabilities in a secure, paper-free, web environment. ACE has fulfilled Executive Order 13659, which mandated the creation of a Single Window. ACE is the system through which the Single Window is realized. ACE is the primary means by which agencies with trade-related responsibilities will receive from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation required for the release of imported cargo and the clearance of cargo for export. These capabilities/mandates align to the DHS mission of Securing and Managing our Borders. 
 A key goal of ACE is to modernize functionality from two legacy systems, the Automated Commercial System (ACS) and the Automated Export System (AES). AES has already been successfully retired and it’s functionality subsumed by ACE in 2014. ACE has modernized all capabilities from ACS except for Collections which will be modernized once funding has been identified. 
 ACE provides considerable benefits to its stakeholders. This includes the enhanced targeting of high-risk shipments and automation, enabling CBP to process cargo faster. Another benefit includes the ability for CBP to focus on border security tasks and inter-agency information sharing, resulting in a more efficient workflow and reduction in the cost of labor and paper intensive activities which are expensive. ACE enables the Government and the private sector to increase reporting accuracy and compliance with U.S. laws, promoting efficiency in Government and improved public service. 
 ACE’s key stakeholders, customers and beneficiaries are CBP, Partner Government Agencies (PGAs), and the Trade community. CBP includes border and trade enforcement personnel who use ACE to process shipments arriving into the U.S. PGAs include 47 government agencies that have statutory relationships with CBP or the authority of cargo and/or a conveyance in an import or export transaction. Trade includes commercial entities that import/export and provide brokerage services to those importing/exporting goods into and out of the US.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The following is the explanation on ROI (47%) as stated in the attached AoA document:  
  
The Return On Investment (ROI) indicates the percent saved in future O&M dollars for every dollar spent on the initial investment. ROI is based on O&M savings in the following areas:   
·          Help desk support -Application, hardware and software maintenance 
·          Data center labor 
·          User Training and Materials 
·          Security Testing   
·          Operational analyses due to lower usage of the mainframe platform   
·          Efficiencies from the CBP target architecture from getting off the mainframe 
·          Reduced licensing costs   
·          Shared system components   
·          Standardizing certification and accreditation   
·          Improving scalability and reliability and instituting open standards.   
The benefits of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface will enhance communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade Community. The improved communications will provide time savings for entry corrections and allow for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE) and saving time and money for the government and the Trade Community.  Ultimately the new functionality will free up more time for port personnel to perform mission work rather than clerical and administrative tasks. ACE's performance metrics map and measure planned cost savings and efficiency improvements that are noted in the Operational Performance section of this document.
ACE will save $36.6M annually by decommissioning the legacy mainframe, once Collections functionality is completed. Currently Collections is an unfunded, and deferred requirement. The program is seeking funds to complete the development of Collections in ACE and retiring the mainframe.
ACE reducescost by providing CBP personnelwith information to better target their compliance and enforcement efforts, increase overall operational effectiveness and by creating one system that provides a single window for CBP to interact, manage, and oversee the import/export data, and enforcement systems to provide end-to-end visibility of the entire trade cycle.  The result is a force multiplication effect for CBP and PGAs that provides officers import processing and tracking, allowing more time and resources to target compliance, enforcement, and national security activities.      
Below are examples of benefits of the ACE system:
-ACE is reliable, it has an availability of  99.37% over the last 365 days. (ACE metric and KPP)
-ACE provides 99.999% of all data required to ATS for targeting and selectivity. (ACE metric and KPP) 
-Savings to CBP due to reduced Primary Processing Time (PPT) thus far in FY18: $5.64M  
-Savings to Trade due to Periodic Monthly Statements and Interest thus far in FY18: $108.405M  
-Savings to CBP Periodic Monthly Statement thus far in FY18: $5.59M.
Below are details from the latest report of ACE Program Metrics on the Operational Effectiveness of the ACE Program:
- 61,034 ACE Trade accounts have been created to date. This represents a 13% increase from last year.
- Average national truck primary processing time is 54.13 seconds for May 2018, which is 42.2 % improvement over the 93.7 second ACS baseline, and is lower than the May 2017 processing time which was 54.92 seconds.","Requirements for this investment include: 
  
1) The delivery of ACE capabilities fulfills the Customs Modernization Act of 1993 by enabling CBP personnel and trade community users to electronically submit and retrieve trade data.  ACE is providing CBP personnel with enhanced automated tools and information to perform security and compliance targeting to decide which cargo poses a potential risk, and what cargo should be expedited because it complies with U.S. laws. SAFE Port Act of 2006 - directed that all agencies requiring documentation for clearing or licensing the importation and exportation of cargo participate in an interagency initiative to establish a single portal system known as the International Trade Data System. ACE is intended to facilitate the collection and distribution of standard electronic import and export data required by all Federal agencies.

As a result, three Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) schedule milestones were not met. In addition, development contracts needed to be extended, causing the program to breach its cost threshold. The ACE program submitted the cost and schedule breach notification to PARM on April 28, 2017. 
An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) acknowledging the cost and schedule breach was sent to CBP by the Under Secretary for Management on May 10, 2017. The ADM directed the program to submit a remediation plan by June 20, 2017. A breach remediation plan was submitted in June 2017, but PARM rejected it due to lack of progress in determining the root cause. An updated remediation plan was submitted by CBP on September 29, 2017 and accepted by the DUSM. On March 15, 2018 CBP submitted the path forward for Collections and ACS Decommissioning. CBP conducted an extensive assessment of options for ACE Collections as well as transition from ACS, including engaging an independent consulting firm to help identify and assess a range of options for addressing Collections functionality. 
Five options were considered and the CBP Commissioner decided to defer Collections requirements and maintain ACS as an interim stop-gap until Collections funding could be identified.

It is used to review air, sea, train, and limited bus passengers and crew in an effort to identify possible terrorists, uncover high-risk individuals, and facilitate the clearance process for legitimate travelers. 
 
The goal of APIS is to facilitate clearance of valid travelers, who are not appearing on watch lists. Commercial/private carriers and aircraft provide APIS information from the biographic information found in the travel documents before traveler boarding of commercial/private vessels and aircraft. The information is then transmitted to CBP prior to departure. It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. 
 
Current benefits of APIS include matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance. APIS currently collects inbound and outbound data for air and sea passengers; converts to World Customs Organization standards to transmit and acquire data; processes Canadian and Mexican APIS data for passengers traveling from overseas. Electronic APIS (eAPIS) and Electronic Notice of Arrival/Departure (eNOA/D) are web-based functions that allow air carriers and vessels operating without advance departure control systems to transmit data electronically to CBP. Small/medium air carriers can upload data to CBP, acknowledge receipt of data to carriers, and allow carriers to view and request performance reports.
 
APIS supports mission delivery by screening the information against law enforcement databases containing “lookout” records from many agencies and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat tonational security and should not be allowed to travel, and target travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry (POE).

APIS improves CBP's efficiency to obtain advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  APIS is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. Benefits provided by APIS to both internal and external to the government cannot be easily quantified. In terms of internal benefits, APIS has proven to be exceptionally valuable and useful.  It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. APIS data is critical to CBP biographical entry/exit systems.  APIS is the single best method by which CBP obtains advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  The apprehension of the Times Square Bomber is the most visible recent example in that APIS alerted CBP that the bomber was attempting to flee the country and where he could be apprehended.
The computerized analysis of inbound and outbound passengers dramatically increases the efficiency of analysis of high risk traveler identification, as well as, facilitation of low risk passenger traffic. Within the APIS, the development of the eAPIS automated report generation module has significantly reduced the time Account Managers spend on processing APIS sufficiency reports. Several of the APIS KPPs shows how APIS has reduced the time and increased accuracy to process all APIS Queries. For example, APIS KPP 73687 - Decrease the average APIS Land VPC Respond Time, has reduced the average processing respond time from 5.5 seconds down to 1.0 seconds in the last two years. Faster responding time has increased the efficiency of how CBP process vehicle primary client significantly.

The current business processes cannot adequately prevent backlog buildups resulting from application surges after statutory/regulatory changes or special events. The ability to quickly adapt to future events will help USCIS to become a more efficient and effective organization and position itself to avoid repeating the backlog cycle.
 
Since the time of legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Agency’s operations have been heavily paper‐based. USCIS business processes revolve around paper forms for nearly all benefit types. To streamline their processes, individual field offices had often sought to acquire their own technology and develop innovative procedures. Procedural inconsistencies can undermine decisional integrity and reduce the ease with which applicants and petitioners conduct business with USCIS. USCIS recognized that reliance on paper files in the modern transaction environment has affected efficiencies related to processing immigration benefits, verifying applicants’ identity, and providing DHS and other government agencies with the information they need to make informed business decisions.

Therefore, the Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated by determining the net benefit, which in this case is the total cumulative cost avoidances for reduced mailings, systems decommissioning, reduced data entry, call center calls, and file movement and storage over the lifecycle of the system (FY12-33), dividing the net benefit by the total initial capital investment, subtracting 1, and converting the remaining figure to a percentage.
A negative 42% ROI indicates that this investment will recover some of its initial purchase and implementation of new capital assets to create a new capability.  However, this ROI calculation is in the early phases of this investment’s development and does not fully quantify the additional internal and external benefits that have not yet been assessed.
The benefits for the system included Transformation Program Objectives:
 
·         Increase security by accurately identifying individuals at each interaction with USCIS.  
·         Increase security by timely sharing of data with partner agencies.
·         Improve immigration benefits system integrity by standardizing processes and systems throughout the agency
·         Improve immigration system integrity by cultivating a culture that respects and protects privacy.
·         Improve ability to detect and investigate fraudulent activity by improving the quality and availability of data.
·         Minimize the burden to customers interacting with the agency.
·         Inform customers in a manner most likely to result in understanding and appropriate action.
·         Provide benefits, quickly, consistently, and accurately to those who are entitled
·         Deliver an openand transparent work environment.
·         Enable managers to match work and resources on a needs basis.
·         Provide a work environment that promotes success.","The most critical enabler for successfully reaching the Transformation Program goals is the realization of the following capabilities:
 
-Account Setup and Case Intake: Creation of a user account  for each unique user (i.e., individual, representative) and provides users with the ability to electronically apply for a USCIS benefit and remit the appropriate payment. 
-Biometric Identification: Capture, storage, and reuse of biometrics for users required to submit biometrics. The ability to permanently link biometrics with the biographic information collected about the user. 
-Background Check: Performance of the necessary background checks based on data captured during case intake, biometric/biographic data collection, and identification. 
-Workflow Management and Capacity: Intelligently assign and route benefit cases based upon risk and case complexity for processing among the workforce. 
-Adjudication: USCIS core mission of determining eligibility for an immigration or citizenship benefit and providing the ability for USCIS to schedule interviews, assess risk and fraud potential, and view electronic files to support analysis and decision‐making. Establishment of an end‐to‐end electronic adjudicative process that ensures procedural consistency across offices and centers; standardizes procedures for case processing; enables internal users to record case notes, decisions and status which can be immediately viewable by all authorized users.
-Document Issuance: Electronic production of benefit documents and certificates. 
-Notices to Applicants and Petitioners:  Electronic authoring and distribution of notices and communication to applicants and petitioners using standard language and templates. 
-E‐Records and Data Sharing: Electronic sharing of information to an array of immigration partners.

The delay in roll out is due to multiple factors: scope creep causing development to take longer; missing the window for beta testing due to the extended development; and not being able to get back on the beta test schedule with the Lockbox system until November (N-600) and December (N-600K). 
The program also started requirements gathering for the I-130 adjustment of status form for family immigration.

FMIS comprises two components: 1)The User Fee System (UFS) supports effective management of the 13 User Fee Programs through automated billing, collection and reporting of user fees as mandated by Congress. 2) The Integrated Budget and Acquisition Planning System (IBAPS) supports budget formulation, budget execution, acquisition planning, and payroll planning. FMIS aligns with HHS’ strategic Goal A Objective 4: Strengthen program integrity and responsible stewardship by reducing improper payments, fighting fraud, and integrating financial, performance, and risk management.   Goals: 1) To facilitate effective management of the funds collected through user fees and appropriations and to provide in-depth financial information to both internal and external stakeholders. 2) To provide FDA enhanced capability to better manage its resources. Objectives include collection of User Fees as required by Congress and management and reporting FDA’s budget.   Current and Anticipated Benefits: UFS collected User Fees totaling nearly $2 Billion in FY15 over 40% of FDA’s annual budget.  UFS is projected to collect in excess of $2 Billion in FY16.  It enables users to calculate and pay fees online and provides related services such as aging of accounts and tracking the status of the collections.  It interfaces with components of HHS’ Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) and with FDA Center systems to provide full fee management services and to support the fee-related analysis and reporting required by HHS, Treasury, and Congress.  IBAPS enables transparency in planning, managing and reporting the source and use of FDA’s funding from both fees and budgetallocation, resulting in improvements in the accuracy and consistency of FDA’s resource management. Stakeholders include the regulated Industry, and all consumers of regulated products. UFS’ primary customers are the providers of FDA regulated products and services. Other FMIS customers are FDA staff responsible for managing and reporting on FDA’s resources, and Congress, which requires accurate reporting on financial information.","009APG18088 - Reducing Opioid Morbidity and Mortality, 009SO18205 - Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","Congress requires FDA to collect User Fees and to provide accurate and timely user fee information.   Fees totaled nearly $2 Billion in Fiscal Year 2015, over 40% of FDA’s annual budget enabling FDA to fulfill its mission.  UFS is projected to collect in excess of $2 Billion in Fiscal Year 16. Public benefits include faster review and reduced time to market for new products. The User Fee System (UFS) enables FDA to meet Congressional requirements for collection and reporting.  Benefits include efficiency and transparency in fee collecting and recording.  UFS generates over 4,000 invoices and collects about 37,000 payments. Its external interface enables industry to submit fees and view the submission status. Customer feedback is positive.  Interfaces with HHS’ UFMS and related systems ensure that fees are reported accurately.  
 
UFS has been in operation for a decade. It is largely steady state, with regular competitive awards for O&M support and enhancements.  Enhancements are incorporated as needed to address additional Fees resulting from Congressional Acts. Upgrades are done to retain technical currency.   Options for alternatives to UFS’ highly customized services are not currently under consideration.  Major reengineering of UFS’ highly customized features would far exceed the cost of maintaining the current system.  
IBAPS will result in improvements in the accuracy and consistency of FDA’s resource management, and enables budget staff to focus on analyses for decision making. This helps the FDA enhance the availability of information on budget formulation, budget execution, financial management, performance and strategic management and external systems to support improved decision making, accountability, and transparency.","Congress requires FDA to collect User Fees and report information about them.

RPMS is critical to IHS operations; it integrates practice management, medical, behavioral health, population health, and performance reporting functions into a fully capable electronic health record (EHR) suite. RPMS evolved alongside the Veterans Administration’s acclaimed VistA HIS but occupies a unique place as the only system designed specifically to support the direct care and public health mission of the IHS. RPMS aligns with the Administration’s commitment to promoting the adoption of EHRs due to their ability to improve health outcomes and decrease costs. RPMS supports the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and HHS Strategic Goal 4 – Objective 4.1 by establishing interoperability through the electronic sharing of information with states, interoperability with commercial labs, and electronic communication among medical staff participating in patient care. IHS is progressing in the full implementation of the Health Information Exchange (HIE), also supporting HHS Goal 4 – Objective 4.1.  RPMS supports HHS Goal 1 - Objective 1.1 by providing a Meaningful Use Certified EHR that supports participation in the Quality Payment Program, as well as provides a Personal Health Record supporting patient-centered care and empowering the patient with personal health information. RPMS is in the mixed lifecycle phase; much of the suite is in operations and maintenance, while enhancements have been implemented for the Meaningful Use Stage 2 Certification, ICD-10 conversion, and currently Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances (EPCS).

For the 5-year period beginning in FY2020, the Cost of the investment is estimated at $259.812M with an estimated Benefit of $6605.825M for the same period based on FY2017 reported total Third Party Collections. The RPMS system provides a framework that provides the data, software, and formats to bill Medicare, Medicaid and Private insurance. It is estimated that Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance collections for IHS operated facilities in 2017 is estimated at $1202.077M as compared with RPMS costs of just over $102M for the same period.  Provider Efficiency:  Using RPMS allows a provider to obtain patient care data via the Patient Care Component (PCC). This facilitates the elimination of duplicate data recording by providers, saving about a minute per patient. It is estimated that this allows for approximate cost avoidances of about $105.248M in FY18 dollars.

CRIS is a system of multiple modules from Allscripts and is interfaced with many other applications to support the Clinical Center’s mission of healthcare research.  CRIS has interfaces to multiple applications specific to departments such as radiology, nutrition, surgery, laboratory and pharmacy.  This integration provides a central source of data, images and reports for patient care givers and clinical researchers of the NIH intramural program.  With the core mission of the NIH as research, CRIS has enabled the intramural program to pool all patient data into one repository creating efficiencies and allowing researchers to analyze increasingly more complex data and results by protocol or across protocols. CRIS continues to meet goals set through a rigorous management oversight and CPIC process.  Budget requests are vetted through the CC ITAG and CC executive leadership.CRIS is supported through the NIH Clinical Center Data Center infrastructure as part of the overall NIH IT Infrastructure, which includes dependencies on the availability of power, cooling, network, etc.   The integration that allows for a central source for data is dependent on the ancillary, or department specific, systems that feed data into CRIS.","009SO18218 - Advance basic science knowledge and conduct applied prevention and treatment research to improve health and development","The Clinical Research Information System (CRIS) is the Electronic Health Record (EHR) for the NIH Intramural Program.  The Office of the National Coordinator indicates that we are required to have a certified EHR that includes clinical decision support, interfaces to clinical information systems, and the ability to share information with patients and other healthcare organizations.  The main impacts from EHRs include improved care coordination, improved diagnostics & patient outcomes, increased patient engagement and improved communication with referring physician partners.
The Return of Investment (ROI) Measurements include:
Improved diagnostics and patient outcomes is a product of having all data in one place and the capabilities of clinical decision support which provides a mechanism to reduce or eliminate uninformed decisions or medical errors.  
Reduction of staff to manage paper documentation and the medical record.  The NIH CC has transitioned to an entirely electronically maintained medical record.  The majority of documentation is entered directly into CRIS, with the remaining paper documentation scanned (primarily consent documents). This transition has decreased contract staff by 6 FTE and saved $2M over two years.  
The return on investment of the personal health record (PHR) is shown through the reduction of staff that manage patient engagement and the amount of paper that no longer is sent to the patient. Since the NIH Clinical Center’s upgrade to a personal health record in 2017, the system has over 13,000 patient-connected accounts. The staffing resources saved would be seen by the institute research care teams and is difficult to measure.
The return on investment of the consolidated reporting to patients’ authorized referring physicians due to the centralization of all the data has been realized through a reduction in the resources needed to print individual paper reports and collate them across multiple systems. When thiswas completed in FY2016 we saw a reduction of 1 contract FTE staff.
Decrease of protocol deviations. The amount of reduction of protocol deviations by having an EHR would be seen by the institute research care teams.
Decreased manual collection of data. Data no longer needs to be copied from the hardcopy medical record and then entered into another system.

CTEP-ESYS collects safety and clinical results data for more than 1500 ongoing cancer clinical trials (trials not yet completed) that monitor more than 45,000 patients per year in more than 24 disease areas. Data reporting and analysis in real time is critical to ensuring adequate monitoring of the ongoing clinical research. Timely data reporting and analysis also assures effective planning for the required successor studies, thus accelerating the evaluation of promising new agents and regimens for patients with cancer. An effective CTEP-ESYS allows investigators and researchers to focus on scientific opportunity, patient safety and reducing the burden of cancer on the public by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. There are over 29 integrated components that support CTEP needs including protocol tracking, drug authorization and tracking, clinical data reporting, adverse event reporting and processing, clinical trials auditing, financial management, investigational new drug and disease management and tracking, annual report generation, regulatory activities, account management, investigator registration, reporting and analysis, and more. CTEP-ESYS is an integrated flexible modular user-friendly IT system that supports the cancer-clinical trials infrastructure. CTEP-ESYS includes an effective and well-constructed management tool that mines complex drug, disease and clinical data into meaningful information and knowledge for decision-making. The goals of CTEP-ESYS are to: - Provide reliable clinical results and toxicity data for the largest sponsor of cancer clinical trials in the U.S. - Shift focus from administrative tasks to science - Improve patient/trial safety - Assure the security and confidentially of proprietary and patient information - Eliminate data redundancy throughout the oncology community - Empower staff to make educated decisions by improving access, quality and timeliness of data - Enhance staff efficiency and capabilities - Provide a Cost Effective Approach to Addressing Administrative, Scientific and Regulatory Concerns.","009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","CTEP-ESYS’s aim is to provide reliable clinical results and adverse event data, assure the safety and confidentiality of proprietary and patient information, eliminate redundancy throughout the oncology community, and empower staff by increasing their efficiency and improving access, quality, and timeliness of data. CTEP-ESYS supports the NIH goals to expand the knowledge base in medical sciences as well as to foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health. The qualitative ROI is realized through improved treatments for cancer, achieved by closely monitoring effectiveness and risks of specific treatments and patient outcomes. The quantitative ROI is to Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals. CTEP enables the NIH to fulfill its role of improving the nation's health through the access, timeliness, and quality of data related to cancer treatments.","In 2004, the Clinical Trials Working Group (CTWG) presented a report that included several informatics based objectives tied to the former NCI caBIG program but also led to the formation of the Operational Efficiency Working Group along with the implementation of several recommendations tied to process improvement and data capture. In 2010, an Institute of Medicine report called for an overhaul in the Cooperative Group program. In 2014, the NCI introduced the National Clinical Trials Network in response to that report resulting in fewer Groups with a focus on collaboration rather than competition (http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/nctn). This change, plus the introduction of the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (http://ctep.cancer.gov/initiativesPrograms/etctn.htm) along with the changes in scientific focus to include an emphasis on translational research, required that NCI informatics evolve to keep pace with the various business and scientific needs. To conduct and manage the investigational anticancer agent development and oncology trials, CTEP has designed, developed and implemented innovative data collection systems, management tools, and internal information storage and communication methods and systems. The development of these tools, methods, and systems as a whole is termed the CTEP Enterprise System (CTEP-ESYS). A module to support each Branch/office in CTEP has been developed and in production with ongoing enhancements based upon changing scientific and business needs. CTEP contains seven branches as seen on the organization chart located on the CTEP web site, http://ctep.cancer.gov/about/org_chart.htm. One of the primary focus is to develop, maintain, and expand the existing CTEP-ESYS to support the NCI research community and to migrate toward future NCI-wide enterprise development initiatives including but not limited to the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP). The CTEP Enterprise System (CTEP-ESYS) is a highly integrated enterprise system consisting of 29 applications.

In FY 2017 eRA managed over $30 billion in funding for extramural grants and administered almost 55,000 extramural awards. Over 5,100 HHS staff, 38,000 research organizations, and 221,000 external users depend daily on the over 60 modules that make up the eRA system to handle the growing workload and increased accountability required. Supporting 24 NIH Institutes & Centers that have extramural programs, four HHS divisions (AHRQ, CDC, FDA, and SAMHSA) as well as the Veterans Administration, eRA provides electronic access to grant applications and awards, progress reports, principal investigator data, and various financial and evaluation reports. Outside scientific reviewers acquire applications and file evaluations online. Acknowledging eRA’s proven record and future potential as a shared service provider for agencies managing health-related discretionary grants programs, the Department of Health and Human Services designated eRA as one of two grants management centers of excellence within the department. eRA has also been designated as a High Value Asset (HVA) by HHS reflecting how crucial the system is to NIH’s mission, and highlighting the critical importance of keeping the system secure, protected and stable. eRA leadership has guided major changes in organizational structure and business practices to align them with the expectations of its diverse customer and stakeholder base.","009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","eRA is the NIH grants management system that provides a cost benefit to HHS by providing the automated grants management capabilities utilized by NIH and several of the HHS OpDivs, including CDC, FDA, SAMHSA, and AHRQ, as well as to the VA. This reduces the cost of duplicative IT expenditures across the different organizations, as well as promotes a collaborative and consistent approach for processing grant applications.  For the eRA user community, one of the major benefits is an integrated enterprise level system that consistently supports the main business areas that comprise the grant life cycle by gathering, validating, processing, routing, consolidating and securing grant related data to empower users to make data-driven decisions. This data and the related processes allow the grantee and grantor community to efficiently and effectively award and manage grants that benefit many aspects in the life of American people. Using the data, the eRA users can also have a better understanding of their own organizations as well as the organizations they serve, how well the business processes work and even derive performance metrics to track and measure the success of the different business functions.  With the common services provided by the eRA system, HHS is avoiding the costs that each of the NIH IC’s and HHS OPDIVs would have to invest in the development of their own systems and the infrastructure to run and maintain it. A conservative estimate for developing and running a medium size system for an IC (10 FTE Contractors, 2 Feds and the required IT infrastructure) is $3.5M a year. The total estimated costs of all the systems combined would be estimated at $100M a year. The total cost avoidance resulting from eRA is estimated at $55M a year.","eRA provides operations and maintenance support for over 60 systems that are required by the NIH IC’s extramural programs. The requirements for these systems originate within the ICs themselves. Additionally, the systems adhere to policies and mandates from OMB, HHS and NIH. eRA is required to continually enhance security and keep NIH’s systems, data and financial activities secure.

The scope of the NBS includes business or “functional” areas: Financial Management, Property Management, Accounts Payable (Commercial Accounts), Acquisition, Service and Supply Funds Operations, Supply Management and Travel Management. Implementing the NBS has yielded qualitative and quantitative benefits to the NIH because it enabled improved business processes and provides more accurate and timely information which better support the scientific mission of the NIH. The NBS benefits are as follows: Reduce the cost and complexity of doing business: Excessive routing and processing redundancies have been reduced by the workflow management capabilities of the NBS.  Increase service levels:  NIH must be more responsive to its “customers”, particularly its scientific staff.  The pace of science demands that NIH service and support organizations: Improve service delivery timeliness and predictability; Improve service quality by identifying and quickly resolving errors; and provide more accurate and timely information through more robust reporting tools. Improve managerial control:  Managerial control refers to accurately tracking and managing all resources in order to refine processes and identify areas for improvement.  Informed and timely decisions rely upon the access to reliable information regarding NIH’s administrative and scientific support systems. Comply with legislation and regulations: The requirements of the Chief Financial Officers Act, the Government Management Reform Act and the Federal Managers Financial Improvement Act dictate standards with which the NIH's accounting system must comply.   The NBS FY2019 Plan is to continue its efforts to remediate the Audit Findings to eliminate and/or remediate any identified material weaknesses and or reportable conditions and be compliant with OMB, Treasury and DHHS requirements.  NBS requested funding for licensing and resource support to execute the HHS Acquisition Lifecycle Framework – Consolidation Acquisition Management System (HALF-CAMS), Treasury Internet Payment Portal (IPP), Oracle R12.2.7+ Upgrade and additional PRISM functionality.  In FY2020 NBS will begin the Planning stage to migrate the NBS infrastructure to a Cloud Based Service model.","009SO18220 - Ensure responsible financial management","The NBS supports approximately 5,500 users from the NIH communities.  NBS system availability was 98% and closed approximately 92% of its incident tickets within the Service Level Agreement (SLA) during FY2018.  
NBS eliminated 75% of its reoccurring End of Month Close manual journal entries, saving approximately 24 labor hours monthly, through system configuration which is an NIH identified material weakness.  This efficiency will result in 288 hours of labor cost avoidance. The implementation of HHS Accounting Treatment Manual (ATM) and utilizing standard Oracle Year-End Close (YEC) functionality, eliminated 80% of custom NIH YEC programs, resulting in operational efficiencies.  Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) back-out processing time improved 87% (from 16 hours-2 hours).  Web Services backlog processing time also was reduced by 67% (from 3 days -1 day). 
NBS satisfied Departmental and Treasury Data Act reporting requirements for all NIH financial assistance and procurement reportable transactions.  NIH participated in a highly successful HHS pilot for DATA Act reporting.  1st QTR FY2018 NIH results has less than a .1% error rate which was statically acceptable and almost 3% lower than the Department’s.
NBS planned activities consist of the PRISM 7.3 Technical Upgrade to include Web Services.  This activity satisfies HHS Acquisition Lifecycle Framework-Consolidated Acquisition Management System (HALF-CAMS) PRISM 7.3 upgrade.  The outcome will maintain the vendor end of life software support requirements and align NIH with HHS HALF-CAMS PRISM 7.3 upgrade mandate.  
The expected outcomes to be achieved from the NIH DATA Act Reporting and Patch Initiative are 1) Replace the interim manual solution for extracting data for the HHS Pilot Data Act Reporting with the Oracle provided Data Act Patches to enable an automated extract solution; and 2) Reduce manual effort of ~8 hours per quarter. As NBS achieved efficiencies with the implementation of DHHS ATM and Oracle standard functionality for YEC, it plans to adopt 100% of the HHS ATM for YEC Closing Entries.  The outcomes to be achieved is the elimination of YEC custom programs and improve compliance.
NIH Corrective Action Plan (CAP) will satisfy NIH CAP Requirements by executing the following FY18 items: 
HHS ATM Compliance
Eliminate non-compliant ATM configurations and replace them with complaint automated solutions
Data Standardization 
Object Class (OC) and Standard General Ledger (SGL) Extension - changing the NIH 4-digit OC to the standard DHHS 5-digit OC and the NIH 6-digit SGL to the standard DHHS 8-digit SGL.
 
Lastly, the Security Funding received will enhance NBS’ monthly analysis of scheduled application/operating system security patches; emergency security/applications patching; vulnerability analysis/remediation; and maintaining/upgrading supported applications to maintain interoperability and end of life upgrades.  NBS will achieve compliance with DHHS/NIH security patching/vulnerability assessment remediation guidelines minimizing IT threats to the environment.  
NBS Infrastructure is engaged with NIH CIT to transition and maximize the usage of virtual environments.   The end goal would be to fully complete the virtual transition of NBS by the end FY19.  Cost analysis is currently underway.","Based on the FY2018 Appendix IX:  FFMIA System Compliance Evaluation, NBS is significantly compliant with the Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR), Federal Accounting Standards and USSGL at the Transaction Level.  A Management Final Compliance determination states non-compliant at the FFMSR and USSGL levels; however, prior year financial statement audit findings are not yet confirmed as resolved as the FY2018 audit results are pending. Additional NIH Corrective Action Plan remediation activities continue into FY2019 with the Fund Configuration Initiative to remediate budget execution findings related to NIH No-year and Management funds.

The NPDB collects data on medical malpractice payments, license/clinical privilege suspensions, civil judgments, criminal convictions, exclusions from health plans, and other adverse actions taken against physicians, nurses, dentists, and other health care practitioners and suppliers.  Eligible users query the NPDB in accordance with legislative authority to inform decisions on hiring, licensing, and credentialing.  NPDB users can self-query for NPDB records, submit a statement with their interpretation of an incident, and/or dispute a report if they disagree with the reported information.    
The NPDB program was mandated by the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (Title IV of PL 99-660, as amended) because Congress found: (1) Increasing occurrence of medical malpractice and the need to improve health care quality warrant greater efforts than states can regulate; (2) A need to restrict the ability of incompetent practitioners to move from state to state without disclosure or discovery of their previous damaging or incompetent performance; and (3) A need to improve the effectiveness of professional peer review.   
The NPDB’s authorities were enhanced by Section 1921 of the Social Security Act (Section 5(b) of PL 100-93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient & Program Protection Act of 1987, as amended), Section 1128E of the Social Security Act (PL 104-191, HIPAA of 1996), and the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  These statutes broadened and strengthened the NPDB’s role in protecting patients, deterring fraud, and improving the quality of the health care industry.   
Per Federal statute, the NPDB is a self-sustaining, fee-for-service program operated by HRSA.   
  
Although the NPDB is a mature system, DME investment is needed for continuous improvement. HRSA seeks to streamline operations, reduce paper, and improve business processes & user experience, use technology to expand reporting compliance, enhance IT security and comply with OMB open-government directives.  Plans include hardening the security posture, expansion of compliance initiatives to other health care entities, adding new self-service options, optimizing customer service, and expanding business intelligence, contributing towards lower help desk demand, more self-service, and lower costs.","009SO18207 - Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs","The NPDB electronically receives, processes, and captures reports and queries on medical malpractice payments, adverse actions, judgments, and convictions. In CY2017 , the NPDB system received approximately 78,000 reports, and processed over 7.8 million queries. Approximately 140,000 physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners utilized the NPDB system to purchase self-queries in 2017. Over 23,000 registered entities interact with the NPDB . Those entities include hospitals, health plans, state license boards, medical malpractice payers and other health care entities. These, and other, entities are required by law to submit reports to NPDB. In addition, entities use the NPDB as a workforce tool for licensing, hiring, and credentialing decisions. In the absence of the NPDB system, these reports would arrive on paper and would not be electronically searchable via query. 
Other essential NPDB operational capabilities include support for entity compliance and practitioner dispute resolution, and publishing a de-identified public use data file. Without the NPDB system, the queries would need to be requested and fulfilled manually on paper. The cost of providing a comparable level of service for queries alone would require HRSA to hire about 700 additional FTEs (assuming each FTE takes 12 minutes to process a query), and would be about five to seven times as expensive as the IT system solution currently in use. Manual, paper-based processes are extremely inefficient and error prone. Though possible to operate the NPDB program manually without an IT system, as the NPDB is required to be self-sustaining, those costs would need to be passed along to the health care entities that use the NPDB. The benefits of continued investment in NPDB system far outweigh the costs.
An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) performed by an independent third party contractor estimated the NPDB total risk-adjusted lifecycle costs for continued O&M and DME activities (for FY17-FY22)to be $103.6M; total discounted costs to be $102.3M; total discounted benefits to be $172.2M; with a Net Present Value (NPV) of $69.9M resulting in a Return on Investment (ROI) of 68.33%. The high ROI justifies the continued investment in the NPDB system. 
The NPDB continues to explore cost savings and cost avoidance by leveraging technology to streamline business processes, using open source tools, and configuring existing tools to avoid costly upgrades. Several incremental system and operational enhancements, contract restructuring, business process improvements, reduction in manual processing resulted in a net cost savings of $24.9M during FY12-FY17. 
Recent cost avoidance examples during FY2018 include avoidance of $650,000 by utilizing an open source web application server, avoidance of $2,000 by implementing the new Search.gov tool for better search capability of the public facing NPDB website. Users routinely search the website for policy resources, how-to infographics, and downloading of de-identified public use file (PUF) for research and statistical purposes. Search.gov provides detailed analytics  allowing insight into user activity. Other cost avoidance examples include $6,000 by utilizing Shareware based Apache James Mail server, avoidance of $300,000 by leveraging the existing Tableau license structure of HRSA Data Warehouse for hosting the public facing NPDB Data Analysis Tool.  The COTS-based Tableau workbook provides a better analytical toolkit for the public.","1.

The FAA determined the safest, most efficient and cost-effective means is a satellite-based navigation capability. WAAS is an aviation system providing precise satellite navigation and landing guidance to equipped aircraft in most weather. WAAS uses a network of precisely located ground reference stations across the U.S., Canada & Mexico to monitor GPS satellite signals. This information is sent to user receivers via leased navigation transponders on Geostationary Earth Orbiting satellites. The messages improve accuracy, availability and safety of GPS-derived position information. WAAS results in safety and capacity improvements in the National Airspace System (NAS) and will reduce FAA operations costs by enabling the removal of portions of the ground-based navigation infrastructure. WAAS Phase IV (Dual Frequency Operations) began in 2014 and will continue through 2044. Phase IV is divided in two: Segment 1 from FY14-FY21 and Segment 2 from FY21-FY44. Segment 1 effort entails sustainment of the existing WAAS single frequency (L1) capability. Segment 2 will introduce a new dual frequency user capability that leverages improvements in the DoD GPS modernization program.  With a GPS Satellite Constellation broadcasting the L1 and (modernized) L5 signal, WAAS DFO supports direct determination of ionospheric corrections in the cockpit using both GPS signals and provides improved coverage over the current L1-only capability by eliminating the effects of solar storms and providing improved protection against interference. Key beneficiaries are general aviation including cargo and regional airlines and helicopter operators. WAAS provides a cost-effective means of integrating a precision approach capability into the cockpit. Program office estimates approximately 91,770 aircraft have been equipped with WAAS avionics. As of July 19, 2018, there are 4,590 WAAS procedures available, over half published at runways that had no precision approach capability. WAAS has many users outside aviation, despite being designed for aviation use. Mapping, surveying, and boaters are likely the largest user base. WAAS received JRC approval on May 21, 2014 for Phase IV Segment 1 (2014-2021).

In 2011, FAA as part of their acquisition management system (AMS) conducted a post implementation review (PIR) of WAAS to determine whether or not the program is achieving forecasted benefits.  Differences between the baselined and actual measures in the OMB Exhibit 300 Program Baseline were examined, including:  cost, schedule, benefits, performance, and mission outcomes.  The PIR team determined that the WAAS investment was achieving the baseline measures in the baseline.

The primary radars included in this portfolio are the ASR-8, ASR-9, and ASR-11 systems that provide aircraft detection and weather information to terminal automation systems within the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities. Data from these radar systems is used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently separate aircraft in the terminal environment for all air traffic passengers. This investment includes more than 230 radars that are as much as twenty to thirty years old, and provides Technical Refresh activities to maintain these legacy systems. Technical Refresh and Sustainment’s have been established to identify and remediate any problems with the aging systems. This includes identifying parts that are no longer being manufactured, and the need to re-engineer components. Technical Refresh and Sustainment activities are proceeding according to plan, and all the radar systems are continuing to provide surveillance data on aircraft operating in the terminal environment. However, without the modifications performed through this portfolio of programs, FAA's TPS portfolio of systems would continue to experience decreasing reliability and availability over time. The Mobile ASR (MASR) also facilitates relocation efforts, when an existing radar structure/facility must be moved in order to support other airport upgrades (e.g., building a new control tower).

These are the primary mission needs addressed by the FTI program. In the course of achieving this primary objective, the FAA has also taken the opportunity to make significant improvements in efficiency and cost effectiveness. As part of the initial implementation, the FAA consolidated services from nine different legacy networks into an integrated infrastructure. The consolidation provided significant cost savings benefits through economies of scale (resulting in a lower unit cost of bandwidth) and the elimination of duplicative functions for each network (e.g., program management, network engineering, security management, etc.).
 
FTI provides state-of-the-art telecommunications services to more than 4,000 FAA facilities nationwide while reducing operating costs, enhancing network security, and improving telecommunications service performance, reliability, and quality.

ERAM, technology wise, is the most complex system of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and National Airspace System (NAS). ERAM assists the current En Route paradigm to migrate from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management. ERAM contributes to the DOT Strategic Plan's Safety goal to reduce transportation related injuries and fatalities and Economic Competitiveness goal of achieving maximum economic returns on transportation policies and investment outcomes. ERAM supports the FAA Strategic Initiatives to deliver benefits through technology by laying the foundation for the NAS of the future by achieving prioritized NextGen benefits and delivering more efficient services. In the NextGen timeframe, demand for air transportation and other airspace services is expected to grow significantly from today's levels in terms of passenger volume, amount of cargo shipped, and overall number of flights. ERAM is committed to increasing capacity and improving efficiency within and providing for a safe NAS. Two functionally-identical channels with dual redundancy eliminate a single point of failure. ERAM increases the number of flight plans that can be stored; provides flexibility in airspace configuration; and extends radar coverage in all ARTCCs by increasing the number of radar feeds. For pilots, ERAM increases flexible routing around congestion, weather, and other restrictions which supports improved safety for the NAS. For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays. Controllers will benefit from reduced workloads along with NAS wide data sharing between ARTCCs.  ERAM also revolutionizes controller training with a realistic, high-fidelity system that challenges developmental practices with complex approaches, maneuvers, and simulated pilot scenarios that are unavailable using today's system. Air traffic controllers and facilities are the backbone of safe NAS operations, transporting the flying public to their destinations efficiently. Key customers/stakeholders include: air traffic controllers; American flying public; air carriers of passengers/cargo; Department of Defense (military aviation); and first responders supporting the Homeland Security mission.","021SO18098 - System Operations and Performance","Two major classes of quantifiable benefits were identified during the ERAM final investment analysis: 1) those that would accrue to the FAA directly and 2) those that would accrue to NAS users. Quantifiable FAA benefits result from the avoided costs of maintaining and refreshing legacy En Route systems and from streamlined information processing in the ARTCCs. Quantifiable user benefits result from an increase in safety and efficiency of the NAS. Safety benefits result from reductions in projected operational errors, operational deviations and the possibility of mid-air collisions. Efficiency benefits result from improved NAS throughput and better routing, as well as having a fully functional backup system. Per OMB guidelines, a 7% discount rate was used to calculate the present value costs and present value benefits, based on the risk-adjusted estimates for benefits and costs denominated in FY03 constant dollars through FY2020. The results indicated a benefit-to-cost (B/C) ratio range of 1.4, and a net present value (NPV) range of $927M with a break-even point of 2017. When the program was rebaselined in 2011, no changes to the program benefits were assumed except for the timeframe for which they were projected to be delivered. To approximate the schedule impact on the benefits and the associated economic analysis, the benefits were shifted by two years with FAA savings starting in FY2006 and user benefits in FY2012. Both cost and benefits were included through FY2022. The ERAM rebaseline business case analysis considered the same benefit areas from the original baseline in order to estimate the NPV of the program and its B/C ratio. The economic analysis from the rebaseline indicated a B/C ratio of 1.3, with a NPV of $626M with a break-even point of 2020. As anticipated, the rebaseline NPV decreased from the original NPV due to additional funds being required to complete deploying the capability to all of the sites. Similarly, the other economic measures were all less favorable as compared to the original baseline with the payback year extending with the revised program schedule. When considering only the future costs and benefits, the NPV increases to $700M and the B/C Ratio is 3.0, with break-even occurring in 2016. The improved economic results are due to the large majority of the investment costs being sunk with the preponderance of the benefits anticipated in the future.

Before ATOP, there was limited aircraft tracking and no automated communications for oceanic air traffic. Pilots would radio position reports based on onboard aircraft navigational systems to the controller. Due to the uncertainty in position report reliability, overseas flights required greater separation margins to ensure safe flight, and were rarely able to obtain maximum fuel efficiency, minimum travel times, or access to preferred flight paths. The ATOP program replaced oceanic air traffic control systems and procedures and modernized the Oakland (ZOA), New York (ZNY) and Anchorage (ZAN) Air Route Traffic Control Centers with a satellite-based, integrated oceanic system. Today, ATOP allows oceanic controllers to be in touch with aircraft in mid-oceanic flight and allows properly equipped aircraft and qualified aircrews to operate using reduced oceanic separation criteria. This enables more aircraft to fly optimal routes, enhancing aircraft flight time (and fuel and payload) efficiency during oceanic legs of their flights. Reduced lateral (side-to-side) separation allows tighter aircraft spacing around optimal city pairs. Reduced longitudinal (nose-to-tail) separation provides more opportunities to add flights without additional delays. The primary beneficiaries of this investment are the airlines, the flying public and the FAA air traffic controllers. The ATOP system allows for safer and more efficient oceanic flights, reduced passenger travel time and reduced airline fuel consumption.","021APG18090 - Reduce Aviation-Related Fatalities, 021SO18103 - Mission Efficiency and Support","The original ATOP ROI calculation was determined in the investment analysis for the ATOP final investment decision and consisted of a Benefit to Cost ratio of 7.2 to 1. The ROI value was based on high confidence estimates calculated through simulation.  Benefits were calculated in relation to Airline Direct Operating costs (ADOC) for Both Atlantic and Pacific routes, and consisted of fuel savings, and reductions in airborne and ground delays. ATOP is a mixed life investment. In June 2009 a Post Implementation Review (PIR) found that available data did not allow for monetization of fuel savings or ground delay benefits but it did allow for examination of metrics like altitude change requests and the identification of ATOP related process efficiency benefits. The PIR analyzed trends at several airports and found that ATOP was shown to decrease controllers’ response times, allowing the FAA to respond to altitude change requests more quickly. The decreased controllers’ response times enabled an increased number of altitude change requests, cleared requests and percentage of cleared requests handled by controllers, demonstrating the benefits of the ATOP program. The ATOP Technology Refresh 2 (TR2) investment will ensure that the FAA is able to continue to deliver promised and planned benefits to oceanic airspace users from the 2018 to the 2028 time frame. The ATOP TR2 solution will provide a maintainable technical foundation to accommodate the integration of current and planned operational requirements through 2028.

WP2 had two primary components: (1) Re-architecture of the TMA platform, and (2) designing, developing, testing and implementing new functionalities. TBFM WP2 built upon time based metering, successfully demonstrated in TMA, to increase arrival throughput and decrease costs and delays. TBFM WP2 expanded time based metering capability to more sites and Integrated Departure and Arrival Capability (IDAC) automated the coordination and management of departures over shared and congested National Airspace System (NAS) resources.

The SASO Program improves, standardizes and automates the FAA's safety oversight system, inspection policies and processes in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization SMS principles. SASO’s primary product, the Safety Assurance System (SAS), is a risk-based, data-supported system that assists Flight Standards Service (FS) Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASIs), in doing their jobs more effectively and efficiently.  FS ASIs are responsible for oversight of the civil aviation industry that uses America’s National Airspace System (NAS) and who are certificated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).   The SAS assists ASIs in developing a thorough risk assessment of aviation industry certificate holders with better quality and more complete data.

SASO Phase 3 expands SAS functionality to support additional CFR Parts for which FS has regulatory oversight responsibility, moves FS closer to full compliance with SMS principles,and implements RBDM into day-to-day oversight of aviation industry certificate holders. A key to success of the SASO Program is its use of change management, such as outreach, communications and training, to educate ASIs and properly transition the workforce.  By combining business process and policy changes, SAS development and deployment, and FS workforce education, the SASO Program contributes to reducing aviation accidents and incidents in the NAS.","021APG18090 - Reduce Aviation-Related Fatalities","System Approach for Safety Oversight (SASO) Phase 2 was completed after fielding the Safety Assurance System (SAS) to all 100 Flight Standards Service (FS) field offices and Headquarters in 2016. This investment provided safety benefits in the form of avoided injuries and fatalities to passengers and crew on commercial flights by major air carriers and commuter operators plus the avoided costs of replacing destroyed or repairing damaged aircraft. During the Joint Resources Council (JRC) Baseline Change Decision in September, 2013, the 2008 baseline ROI of 180% (a benefit/cost ration of 2.8) was reviewed and remained unchanged.
 
SASO Phase 3 is extending safety benefits to the general aviation (GA) community by developing and enhancing SAS functionality. These benefits are largely qualitative because data collection resources are far greater for large organizations like an airline than for individual pilots. GA benefits derive largely from human factors sources that are difficult to measure objectively, such as the effect of pilot and aircraft mechanic training, and the benefits of advanced simulator training, on the reduction of aviation accidents and incidents. In SASO Phase 3, the SAS is tailored to the characteristics of GA, the oversight of which varies widely from individuals and non-organizational certificate holders to large organization certificate holders. SASO Phase 3 does provide cost benefits by standardizing and streamlining business processes, and implementing SAS functionality, for coordinating and reducing the number of trips for maintenance provider surveillance.
 
Based on DOT guidance, the value of avoided fatalities or equipment damage was applied to the investment cost and benefits calculations. As presented to the JRC at the Final Investment Decision in February, 2016, SASO Phase 3 has a ROI of 18.4%.","To meet the FAA's Strategic Priority, 'Make Aviation Safer and Smarter', Flight Standards Service (FS) will implement a Safety Management System (SMS) and leverage the capabilities of the Safety Assurance System (SAS), the principal means by which FS will implement safety assurance, one component of the SMS.
  
SAS provides a comprehensive, standardized approach for the oversight of aviation industry certificate holders. It is an automated, decision support system based on system safety principles and embraces a proactive, risk-based approach to oversight. This system allows Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASIs) to make independent assessments while supporting data sharing, collaboration, and open communication.
  
In an increasingly complex operational environment, the SAS allows the FS workforce to use data-supported system-wide analysis and focus their resources on the highest risk safety areas rather than trying to be everywhere to observe everything as the legacy system required. This will result in reducing one of the root causes of aviation accidents and achieving the FAA strategic goals.

The goals of the Program are to procure, deploy and maintain Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology, at and between Ports of Entry, to enable CBP’s border security mission without impacting legitimate trade and traffic. Current priorities of the program are to maintain or improve NII examination rates across vectors, while offering efficiencies and increased ability for officers to identify anomalies in conveyances.  To do this, current projects are focused on identifying solutions which address four primary capability gaps: (1) aging technology, (2) stand-alone technology, (3) data-networking and integration, and (4) lack of radiation scanning in the rail environment. 
  
In FY17, CBP conducted approximately 6.5 million NII examinations, which resulted in more than 2475 seizures weighing 359,000lbs and $3.9 million. These systems are force multipliers, with tremendous economic impact. The average NII system examination of a cargo container takes approximately 8 minutes, while a manual inspection takes, on average, 2 hours. This approach expedites trade without sacrificing security, while also minimizing costs. CBP estimates that NII technology provides an annual workforce saving/avoidance of approximately 7,000+ additional CBP officers. Key customers of the Program are CBP Field Offices and the CBP frontline officers and Border Patrol agents who operate the NII technologies. Key stakeholders of the Program include Congressional Committees with a focus on, but not limited to, Homeland/Transportation/Border/Maritime Security and Appropriations; OMB; DHS - Science & Technology (S&T), U.S. Coast Guard, and CBP; General Services Administration; Trade Community; Port Authorities and Terminal Operators; and original equipment manufacturers and service support providers of NII technologies. Other beneficiaries include U.S. citizens; individuals traveling to the U.S.; R&D communities seeking to advance imaging and detection capabilities; and international communities with similar inspection and detection technology or operations.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The calculated ROI for the NII program shows a net return of 123.4% based on a net present value (NPV) analysis in the initial Analysis of Alternatives.  Since that analysis, the NII Program has reached ADE-3 and is procuring and deploying the technology as planned.  The performance of the deployed NII technology supports the previously estimated ROI, and is achieving the projected benefits (internal and external; and quantitative and qualitative benefits). Continued benefits and the ROI have been validated through new technology specifications (throughput, accuracy, reliability, etc.) and acceptance tests of those specifications for new and replacement technology.  Actual performance in the field has validated the operational capabilities of the technology upon which the initial benefits were estimated and the ROI calculated. A new ROI has not been calculated but the reasonableness of the initial estimate is confirmed because the program costs are near the LCCE and the quantitative benefits of technology capabilities are as estimated.  The qualitative benefits, including those to commercial trade, are supported by the timeliness of inspections and the results of the 2016 and 2017 calendar year Operational Analyses.
  
The NII Program provides internal and external benefits that are quantified and used to calculate the ROI.  Internally, NII systems reduce the time to conduct a manual exam by over 93 percent; an NII exam takes 8 minutes and a manual exam takes 120 minutes. To quantify this reduction: over 20 million vessel and truck containers with a market value of about $1.5 trillion annually enter the United States at and between Ports Of Entry (POE). Of these containers, NII large-scale technology is used to inspect approximately 10 percent of the targeted vessel and truck containers (about 2 million containers). Without using NII technology, the same number of exams would take an additional 3.8 million man-hours or approximately 7,000 additional CBP officers. NII systems also provide operational benefits spanning personnel safety, speed, and accuracy of detection. 
  
From an external perspective, the expedited inspection process - made possible with NII technologies - saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed. This is cost avoidance to the trade industry of approximately $5.8 billion to $17.5 billion per year. This cost is based on a parametric estimate using current literature on the cost of transit time for the delivery of goods. While NII technology offers exceptional deterrence benefits at and between the Nation’s POEs, the greatest qualitative external benefit of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism. Through the use of NII equipment CBP has increased the number of and the quality of cargo inspections which decreases the probability that Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) or other instruments of terrorism will enter the U.S.","The Program will provide efficient and effective technological capabilities to interdict and detect illegal weapons, contraband and people arriving at the U.S. borders without affecting trade or travel.

Since ADE-3 approval, the Life Cycle Costs of the program have been reduced with a reduction in the total lifecycle cost objective in the FY18 Update. This has been achieved via Acquisition (competitive pricing, volume discounts, lower-energy technology) and Maintenance (competitive pricing, firm-fixed price contracts). However, the program acknowledges further approaches are necessary for affordability across the Future Years Homeland Security Program, such as: use of carryover funds, deployment prioritization, changing rates of system retirement, maximizing cost savings, and trade-offs amongst large-scale, small-scale, training, maintenance standards, and technology demonstrations.

The investment also supports the EPA s cross-cutting fundamental strategy of advancing state, tribal, and international partnerships by serving as EPA's point of presence on the Environmental Information Exchange Network (EN).  The EN serves to improve data quality and reduce the burden of environmental reporting and information exchange among state and tribal partner governments.  In addition to fulfilling these core mission functions, reusable CDX technology services ensure that EPA program offices and partner governments meet standards for identity management under the Federal Information Security and Management Act and legal non-repudiation and electronic signatures in accordance with the Cross-Media Electronic Reporting Regulation (CROMERR).  CDX interfaces with other federal shared services such as Grants.gov, Pay.gov, and the technology has been a model for other federal activities including FederalReporting.gov. BY 2020 funding will allow the system to expand its capacity, build new data exchanges, and implement CDX Next Generation Architecture, which includes implementation of new technology eEnterprise solutions, and expanded cloud computing, where applicable. This funding will also allow the CDX team to perform maintenance activities on existing data exchanges and nodes and conduct R&D to further reduce the cost of electronic data exchange.","020APG18042 - Accelerate Permitting-Related Decisions, 020APG18043 - Accelerate the Pace of Cleanups and Return Sites to Beneficial Use, 020APG18045 - Improve Air Quality by Implementing Pollution Control Measures to Reduce the Number of Nonattainment Areas, 020SO18131 - Improve Air Quality: Work with states and tribes to accurately measure air quality and ensure that more Americans are living and working in areas that meet high air quality standards., 020SO18133 - Revitalize Land and Prevent Contamination: Provide better leadership and management to properly clean up contaminated sites to revitalize and return the land back to communities., 020SO18134 - Ensure Safety of Chemicals in the Marketplace: Effectively implement the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, to ensure new and existing chemicals and pesticides are reviewed, 020SO18135 - Enhance Shared Accountability: Improve environmental protection through shared governance and enhanced collaboration with state, tribal, local, and federal partners using the full range of compliance assurance tools., 020SO18136 - Increase Transparency and Public Participation: Listen to and collaborate with impacted stakeholders and provide effective platforms for public participation and meaningful engagement., 020SO18137 - Compliance with the Law: Timely enforce environmental laws to increase compliance rates and promote cleanup of contaminated sites through the use of all of EPA's compliance assurance tools, especially enforcement actions to address environmental violations., 020SO18138 - Create Consistency and Certainty: Outline exactly what is expected of the regulated community to ensure good stewardship and positive environmental outcomes., 020SO18139 - Prioritize Robust Science: Refocus the EPA's robust research and scientific analysis to inform policy making., 020SO18140 - Streamline and Modernize: Issue permits more quickly and modernize our permitting and reporting systems., 020SO18141 - Improve Efficiency and Effectiveness: Provide proper leadership and internal operations management to ensure that the Agency is fulfilling its mission., 020SO18259 - Provide for Clean and Safe Water: Ensure waters are clean through improved water infrastructure and, in partnership with states and tribes, sustainably manage programs to support drinking water, aquatic ecosystems, recreational, economic, and subsistence activities.","The ROI for CDX services is achieved through cost avoidance across multiple Agency information exchange systems and through time savings for government employees.  By re-using centralized services, the EPA program offices and Environmental Information Exchange Network (EN) partners will avoid redundant investment in the development and operations of information exchange and identity management services. To evaluate ROI, the EPA has reviewed past and present financial data, and conducted experience interviews and analysis regarding five (5) selected Program Offices. All five Program Offices analyzed have experienced significant benefits. For example, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI data) quality has improved as the number of errors/submissions have significantly dropped through CDX usage.  CDX has also enabled the Internet Onboarding Application (iBoard) to realize significant security improvements in managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) has experienced much greater data accessibility through data storage with CDX. The Office of LEAD saw more than $537k in savings between 2009 and 2015 by using CDX. These few examples highlight the incredible returns on investment that CDX provides its customers.  In addition to the ongoing ROI from the existing set of services, the new BY20 services for integrated interfaces will contribute to Agency-wide goals for regulatory burden reduction.  In addition, the new reusable CROMERR compliant electronic signature services and cloud-based nodes will lead to cost avoidance for program offices and EN partners, particularly for costs related to software development and hosting infrastructure.","EPA established CDX partly in response to the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) - http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/electronic-signature-technology.html

To accomplish this mission, EPA relies on core financial management functions such as budget execution, accounting, payments and collections, financial statements, and financial accountability reports.  The Financial Replacement Systems (FinRS) investment is the EPA Office of the Chief Financial Officer's (OCFO) ongoing maintenance of the agency's core financial systems and the Time & Attendance system which support the EPA s most critical business needs.  The core component, Compass, meets the following business needs: General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Project Cost, Intra-Governmental Transactions, Budget Execution and Financial Reporting to support these functions.  This system supports 706 active users across 13 EPA Headquarters Offices, 10 Regional Offices, and a number of field locations across the United States.  The Time & Attendance system supports 15,681 active users. The Time & Attendance System was upgraded from 8.9 to 9.2 removing many EPA unique customizations and pulling the financial activity of payroll cost allocation out of People Plus and into the core financial system under the Payroll Cost Allocation Module.

OCFO's IT Modernization Guiding Principals have allowed OCFO to focus on the following efforts.  This will streamline operations utilizing a shared services approach which will allow enhancements to how activities such as payroll projections are conducted in a uniform manner across the Agency.  It will establish an integrated financial and administrative shared services offering. The overall goal is to improve service delivery and reduce fragmentation, overlap, duplication, and overall costs through standardization, economies of scale, and continuous business process improvements. This approach will deliver one integrated financial management system that meets user needs, supports data quality, and enables data analytics. Our Payment Processing Modernization (PPM) and Financial Acquisition Modernization Effort (FAME) projects will begin addressing these areas along with New Pay.  It is currently a 7 stage effort with each stage containing phases to support the functionality being streamlined.  The following systems and/or interfaces will be decommissioned as part of the PPM project; SPITS, DCS, AIMS, OFM Middleware, OMIS/IRMS, CPS, IDOTS, ECOSTAT.  Estimated overall savings to the Agency will be $3 Million per year.","0 - Not Applicable","EPA and the public will receive considerable benefits through the implementation of the Core Financial System, including,
 
 	improved business processes, streamlined operations, and information management.
 	secure, accessible, fully web-enabled, cloud-ready infrastructure.
 	efficiencies and transparency in capturing and providing information to the public on EPA mission and initiatives.
 
Outcomes from the implementation of these components include the transformation of business processes, for example in the areas of Accounts Receivable, which will allow the Agency to more effectively, manage and improve its collections capabilities. In streamlining processes throughout financial management, EPA will recognize cost avoidance through the elimination of cuff systems and additional administrative systems and through improved efficiencies gained in the execution of business processes.
 
The reporting functionality implemented with the Core Financial System component will provide timely and accurate core financial reports to support decision-making and Agency reporting needs.   In line with OpenGov initiatives, this reporting functionality will provide reporting solutions, drill-down capabilities and other mechanisms; such as Data Visualization and Data Analytics to deliver timely, meaningful and accurate financial information.
 
EPA s current system infrastructure relies on nightly batch cycles to update the Core Financial System, limited flexibility for data entry, and another cycle to update reporting tools. These antiquated solutions also limit EPA s ability to transform its business practices to meet the changing needs of the Agency in key business areas as well as standard financial reporting and statement generation. Under the legacy architecture, ancillary solutions and workarounds have been created to meet the ever-changing business needs of the Agency, increasing cost and risk.
 
The Core Financial System component will provide EPA with transparent, timely, mission-critical data. In the case of the BP oil spill, these components would have allowed EPA faster access to information to make critical decisions. These components provide solutions that can meet these needs, such as fee processing, through configuration of existing functionality rather than a buy and build  strategy. With these components, EPA will better serve the public, protect the environment and be prepared to respond to emerging issues challenging the Agency.","The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act):    The core financial system is being updated to support key changes in support of the Data Act to include: Award ID, PIID, GTAS and eInvoicing.",yes,no,no,,,"Michael L.

Phase I, implemented in FY2002, created an integrated system to support federal enforcement and compliance tracking, targeting and reporting, including GPRA reporting.   Phase II, also called Permit Compliance System (PCS) Modernization, expanded ICIS to include the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), enabled management of the complete program (e.g., stormwater), and replaced the legacy PCS.  PCS was an Agency Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) weakness, and the modernization of the system was critical to address the weakness.  Phase II was first implemented in FY06 for the online management the NPDES program. Electronic reporting capabilities were added for states to be able to flow Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) and other data from state systems via the Exchange Network and CDX to ICIS.  Electronic reporting capability was also added to receive DMR data directly from NPDES permittees. With the promulgation of the NPDES e-Reporting Rule, OECA is working to build tools to support additional electronic reporting from regulated facilities so they can flow more data to ICIS.  Phase III modernized the Air Facility System (AFS) via integration with ICIS. Phase III has increased transparency and accountability of federal, state, and local agencies and facilities by providing integrated and more complete data. Phase III has reduced burden for EPA Regions, state and local agencies, and the regulated facilities, by eliminating dual reporting info multiple federal systems and leveraging electronic reporting tools developed for ICIS Phase II. The Implementation of Release 1 of this phase occurred in FY15.  These innovations support EPA s Strategic Goal 5 (Protecting Human Health and the Environment by Enforcing Laws and Assuring Compliance) by ensuring that EPA and States have current and complete information to manage their Enforcement and Compliance programs.  ICIS today supports over 2500 users nationwide from HQ, 10 regions, 50 states, and multiple tribes/territories/local agencies.  ICIS information is available to the public through Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO).","020APG18046 - Increase Environmental Law Compliance Rate","A Post Implementation Review (PIR) was completed for ICIS on April 3, 2017.  This independent review focused on the implementation of the ICIS-Air release and explored the benefits that were gained and how the users perceived these changes.  ICIS-Air, Implemented in October 2014, is the third of three major releases of ICIS.  It not only added functionality to support the Clean Air Act (CAA) Stationary Source Program, but it updated several areas of the existing functionality that supports Enforcement and Compliance for other programmatic areas beyond CAA.

The approach taken for this evaluation, was two-fold.  First a user survey was performed to assess the user s acceptance of the system.  Second, the review evaluated how closely ICIS aligns with its mission.  The PIR found that the ICIS-Air implementation was generally successful and met most of the objectives outlined by the OECA AFS Modernization Strategy group. OECA successfully replaced an antiquated, mainframe system and brought it into alignment with EPA s standard technologies and target enterprise architecture. Most users are satisfied with general ICIS capabilities and over half of responding ICIS-Air users agree it is an improvement over the legacy system.  Overall ICIS users are satisfied with general ICIS capabilities and functionality as well as module-specific (ICIS-Air, ICIS-NPDES) capabilities. ICIS users are also generally satisfied with the user support they receive.  ICIS-Air conforms with EPA standards and technologies. Security planning and assessment processes are in place to ensure the system continues to meet EPA and federal security requirements.  These benefits are realized by Federal, State, and local Agency users.

ICIS, in 2017 and 2018, replaced the AVOKA COTS product with a much more flexible and cost effective solution.  This resulted in an annual savings on software licences of $120K/yr.  In addition, the cost to develop eReporting Tools using the new solution has resulted in a 40% reduction in cost to develop these applications.  So far, five applications have been developed, with several dozen planned for the future.  These savings are realized by EPA and have reduced development costs.  Savings are also being realized by states who are able to use these tools, and therefore are not having to develop their own solutions to meet the federal NPDES eReporting requirements.","One recent legislative mandate is the NPDES eReporting Rule, that was promulgated in December 2015.

To support that purpose, EDAP introduces and maintains the advanced technology capabilities that are required to store, present and analyze the electronic data collected by or provided to the FBI.  The current EDAP investment meets this goal through four legacy applications: Data Warehousing System (DWS), the Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS), Data Loading and Analysis System (DaLAS), BaseJumper.  Prometheus, a modernization project central to achieving the goals of EDAP, is a new information technology (IT) and knowledge sharing system built upon the successes of the exiting FBI EDAP systems described above. Prometheus will provide the FBI with the ability to ingest, store, and index disparate datasets (both structured and unstructured data) related to its criminal law enforcement and national security missions in a single location.  This data includes, but is not limited to, data that is collected pursuant to legal process or authorized investigative technique, data that is created by the FBI (such as an analytical product), as well as data that is provided to the FBI by its partner agencies, sources, and the public.  The net benefits of the Prometheus modernization project include: 

 	Breaking down current data silos across the organization, creating one unified ingest process with common enrichments, security, and legal compliance.
 	Enabling FBI agents and intelligence analysts to be more efficient and effective through the use of a single data lake to  connect the dots  with powerful analytics.
 	Making the FBI IT enterprise more efficient by allowing the retirement of some legacy data systems and reducing the development overhead (handling security, compliance, storing and indexing data) for applications through utilizing the data within Prometheus.

Building upon capabilities introduced through EDAP, the goal of Prometheus is to provide the FBI with a highly scalable IT platform to enable investigators, analysts, and professional staff access to a broad array of data sets through common Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  While Prometheus works to modernize the data and analytic platform within EDAP, another modernization effort known as the Global Mission Analytics (GMAN) will consolidate the existing User Interfaces within EDAP.","011SO18276 - Disrupt and defeat terrorist operations, 011SO18278 - Combat unauthorized disclosures, insider threats, and hostile intelligence activities","The net benefits of the EDAP investment will include: 
 	Breaking down current data silos, creating one unified ingest process with common enrichments, security, and compliance
 	Enabling FBI agents and intelligence analysts to be more efficient and effective through the use of a single data lake to  connect the dots  with powerful analytics
 	Making the FBI IT enterprise more efficient by supporting the continued retirement of some legacy data systems and reducing the development overhead for applications through utilizing the data within Prometheus.

Typically, based on current FBI application development costs, a majority of those costs are toward data storage, ingest, and infrastructure.  Every time an application has to be developed, they take on this overhead cost.  Through the Prometheus modernization effort, these costs can be re-invested as the data platform will handle the storage, ingest, security, and compliance in a common way, allowing applications to consume Prometheus services to develop their application.  Additionally, through utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other data science techniques, Prometheus will reduce the time to create actionable insights for FBI agents and intelligence analysts.  Instead of analysts taking days to manually read through unstructured data, this can be automated to extract important content in a matter of minutes.","Outstanding Audit Finding or Material Weakness: Webster Commission Report on Fort Hood - The data processing and storage capacities of the Bureau s current IT systems are unable to keep up with continually increasing volume, variety, and velocity of investigative data being acquired by the FBI. For example, the growth of data contained within in one ITADD system grew as much in a recent 18 month as had in the previous 10 years. This necessitated a horizontally scalable big data platform and the computational resources required to perform necessary analytics.

Launched in 2004 as a web-enabled and paperless counterterrorism incident management system, Guardian's goal is to allow all terrorist threats and suspicious activities to be recorded and instantaneously accessible by all application users. Guardian benefits users by providing threat and suspicious activity information at a point when threat mitigation through deployment of resources is optimal leaving no threat incident unaddressed. 

The Guardian program incorporates two information systems, Guardian and eGuardian. The systems enable communication and collaboration between FBI, state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) law enforcement partners regarding terrorist threats, building strong and functional liaison partnerships for combating terrorism. These two systems also communicate and transfer information to other stakeholders in Department of Homeland Security organizations including the PM/ISE.

The classified version, Guardian, is used by all FBIHQ units, FBI Field Offices, Legal Attaches, Other Governmental Agencies (OGA) and Intelligence Community partners. Based on the application's success for threat analysis, the FBI has designated Guardian as the sole system of record for documenting all official counterterrorism early stage investigations known as Type 1 and Type 2 Assessments. Recently the stakeholder group has been extended to include the FBI's Counterintelligence and Cyber Divisions. Currently there are over 128,816 threat and suspicious activity incidents in Guardian with services extended to 25,102 registered accounts and 18,639 active users. Over 142,553 Guardian incidents have been closed resulting in 5,321 FBI Full Investigations (FIs) and 5,259 Preliminary Investigations (PIs). The unclassified version, eGuardian, has been deployed to the SLTT law enforcement partners via Law Enforcement Online (LEO). All citizens benefit from the one-way transfer of information from eGuardian to Guardian allowing mission critical information to be shared at a point when it can make a difference in the outcome of a terrorist scenario. eGuardian now contains 24,993 incidents and services 5,086 registered accounts and  1,472 active organizations.","011SO18276 - Disrupt and defeat terrorist operations, 011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime, 011SO18283 - Uphold the rule of law and integrity in the proper administration of justice","The Guardian Program continues to implement enhancements to extend its capabilities and reduce administrative workload, which in turn reduces human error in investigation and analysis of threat. Recently, Guardian integrated with the FBI's case management program, significantly reducing administrative burden and enabling the Bureau to capture and exploit efficiencies by merging the two applications and streamline information sharing. Guardian also extended its capability beyond its counterterrorism function, to enable other investigative arms in the Bureau to use its capabilities to assist in threat analysis. In the upcoming years, Guardian will leverage new technologies to enable rapid deployment to production enhancements and improve application performance. eGuardian will leverage the same technology with the same benefits and is also working towards deploying a mobile capability, further extending the application's benefits to the Bureau's law enforcement partners. 

These actions are an example of the Guardian program wisely and frugally using taxpayer dollars to the best extent possible. The integration of Guardian and the case management application increases employees' time to conduct other activities. The extension of Guardian to other investigative areas eliminated the need to fund a new application to handle the same task, thus preventing the pipelining of business and allowing for the sharing of information. The use of the new technology for the Guardian and eGuardian infrastructure enables the program to leverage economies of scale and reduce cost by only paying for resources (processor power, storage, services) used.","- Legislative Mandate - Develop the interchange of information between agencies and appropriate authorities of State, local and tribal governments.

Risk is associated with not practicing records management.  The risks range from noncompliance with standard records management practices, regulations, and DOE requirements to exposure to potential litigation.  Keeping records beyond their destruction period increases the risk of litigation.  Should the government agency or company become party to a lawsuit, the inability to demonstrate compliance with a systematic disposition process increases the agency s or company s liability during discovery and litigation. 
 
Benefits External to the Government:  Three recent examples where not complying with their own records disposition processes contributed greatly to their liability are the Enron, Arthur Anderson, and Morgan Stanley accounting cases.  In addition good records management and configuration control indirectly benefit all project activities associated with the cleanup mission at the Hanford site.

The N-DEx System s creation was an answer to the 9-11 Commission, which called for better information sharing among local, state, tribal, and federal criminal justice agencies.  The N-DEx System complements other well-known FBI systems, such as the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Interstate Identification Index (III), and Next Generation Identification (NGI), by offering additional criminal justice lifecycle information.  These records include detailed incident/case reports, arrests, missing persons reports, service calls, booking and incarceration reports, pre-trial, probation and parole reports, warrants, citations/tickets, and field contacts/field interviews. Collectively, this information promotes safety from the initial patrol stop to release from community corrections, and supports the FBI's mission of protecting the American people.  

The N-DEx System provides access to more than 801 million searchable records from over 7,301 criminal justice agencies.  In addition to local, state, regional, and tribal data, records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), United States (U.S.) Marshals Service, and Department of Defense (DOD) records are also searchable via the N-DEx System.  By using the N-DEx System, users can uncover relationships between people, crime characteristics, property, and locations; generate integrated biographies of subjects; and eliminate information gaps by linking information from criminal justice professionals working similar cases.

In BY2020, the N-DEx Program Office will implement new use codes to support suitability determinations for federal employment, credentialing, and related federal matters; and security risk assessments pursuant to the Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002.  The N-DEx Program Office will also work towards improving the data integration process, which will expedite onboarding of new criminal justice agencies. Furthermore, the N-DEx Program Office will continue to transition the N-DEx System to a cloud platform.","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime, 011SO18283 - Uphold the rule of law and integrity in the proper administration of justice","Consistent feedback from the criminal justice community suggests the N-DEx System provides a cost-effective mitigation to existing information sharing challenges.  During the phased development of the N-DEx System, the N-DEx Program Office surveyed the criminal justice (CJ) community to assess the anticipated benefits upon implementation; the respondents indicated the perceived market value to be approximately $625 million ($781 million in 2018, controlling for inflation). The investment in the N-DEx System, from concept to current operating capability totals approximately $518 million, a cost roughly 66% of today s estimated adjusted market value.  This model also assumed that the N-DEx System would complement existing local, state, and regional information sharing capabilities, when in fact a number of agencies have actually replaced existing Record Management Systems (RMS) with the N-DEx System. 
 
Although difficult to directly quantify the return on investment tied to the N-DEx System s stated mission of reducing crime and safeguarding the American people through strategic information sharing, agencies routinely share every-day benefits realized from use of the system.  In previous user assessments, half of respondents reported faster access to investigative information, and seven out of ten indicated improved quality of investigative information, due to the availability of the N-DEx System.  In addition, the N-DEx Program Office receives dozens of stories from users, which detail how the N-DEx System assisted in a wide range of investigative successes, including apprehension of human traffickers, sex offenders and absconders, and the prevention of criminal justice employment by individuals falsifying information on employment applications.  The following success story, chosen as the 2018 N-DEx Success Story of the Year, demonstrates a specific benefit of the N-DEx System.  

In early 2017, the Sprint store in Southaven, Mississippi became a victim of larceny when a group of four individuals entered the store and stole $400 from an unsecured cash drawer.  Although the act was a misdemeanor, command staff at the Southaven Police Department wanted the case investigated and publicized in an attempt to dissuade others from similar crimes in the future.  After apprehending two uncooperative subjects, and armed with only some basic identifiers gathered during the booking process, a detective was able to use the N-DEx System to quickly link and associate additional accomplices.  He also uncovered a much deeper web of criminal activity: a multi-state felony commercial theft organization spanning five additional states, stretching from Georgia to New York.  Two of the subjects were convicted on multiple charges, and two remain wanted on non-extradition warrants.  Three of the subjects have since been arrested by other agencies for similar crimes.  The detective stated, Without the powerful resources of N-DEx, the investigation would have likely ended with misdemeanor charges on only two of the four subjects.","Presidential mandate (Executive Order (EO) 13388); Congressional mandate (S.2845 H. Rpt. 108-796-Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004).  EO 13388 created the Information Sharing Council (ISC) to provide advice and information concerning the establishment of an interoperable terrorism information sharing environment to facilitate automated sharing of terrorism information among appropriate agencies.  The N-DEx System is strategically aligned with the ISC and the Information Sharing Environment (ISE), which has government-wide authority granted by the Congress to serve as a trusted broker facilitating the development of a network-centric ISE by promoting standards and architecture, security and access, and associated privacy protections.  The ISE adopted a distributed, decentralized model which, instead of relying on a central database of terrorism information, requires an ISE that connects existing systems, a model which enables cooperation across federal agencies and among state, local, tribal, private sector and international partners. This model also lessens the risks of privacy abuses, compromise, or data breaches.  The N-DEx System strategy contributes to the fulfillment of the ISE by enhancing information sharing among criminal justice agencies at the local, state, tribal, and federal levels by providing various access methods to criminal justice information.

Title 18, Section 922 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), defines who is prohibited from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving any firearm or ammunition in or affecting commerce.  The NICS Regulation, Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Part 25, Subpart A requires the NICS to provide Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL) with an immediate response regarding the person from whom the receipt of a firearm would violate the U.S.C.  If the initial response is a ""delay,"" the NICS is required to provide the FFLs with a final determination within three business days.  The NICS Regulation provides the states with the option to act as a point of contact (POC) for NICS background checks and allows the FBI to serve as the POC in those states that have chosen not to perform the checks.  The NICS Regulation required development of other electronic means of contact; as a result, the NICS E-Check was developed.  This function enables the FFLs to initiate an unassisted NICS background check for firearm transfers via the Internet.  When the FFLs conduct a NICS check, name and descriptive data is submitted to the NICS to determine if prohibitions exist.  During Fiscal Year (FY) 2007, the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division's NICS Section initiated an extensive Business Process Redesign study to seek opportunities to improve the NICS.  On 08/13/2009, the NICS Section initiated a requirements study for the development of a new NICS that encompassed all internal and external processes, interfaces, and functionality required throughout the NICS community and outlined required modifications and improvements to the NICS to allow continued system operating capabilities.  The continued success of the NICS is dependent on the New NICS development which will provide increased system availability and automate the NICS transaction life-cycle process.  Efficiencies will be gained by reducing system/software redeliveries, utilizing Computer Telephone Integration technology, and having complete interoperability with NICS partners and agencies.  The primary beneficiaries of the NICS are the American public (protection from violent crime and terrorist acts) and law enforcement/public safety personnel.","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime, 011SO18283 - Uphold the rule of law and integrity in the proper administration of justice","The system redesign will focus on hardware and software infrastructure improvements and transform the NICS Section's business approach by automating system functionality.   It will also increase employee efficiencies by implementing automated workflow allowing the servicing of multiple transactions, automating manual processes, and eliminating redundant data entry.  The system redesign will provide a platform to automate, streamline, and add functionality for automatic status determinations and will automate the transfer of transaction and call data without data re-entry, effectively reducing processing time.  The system redesign will improve service through the addition of Computer Telephone Integration.  Additional benefits include the ability to accommodate frequent legislative changes through increased system flexibility, support growing volumes by increasing system capacity and scalability, increase accuracy and security by consolidating disparate databases, improve access for FFLs by providing an electronic interface, improve efficiency for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives through Internet accessibility, and support POC States to reduce risk of these states transferring their workload to the FBI.","Legislative Mandate such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993(amended by the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007,Public Law 110-180)establish a NICS system that any licensee may contact,by telephone or by other electronic means,for information to be supplied immediately on whether a receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee would violate Section 922,Title18,of US Code or state law.Safe Explosives Act(11/25/2002)requires a background check on responsible persons and employees authorized to possess explosive materials;Energy Policy Act of 2005-requires a firearm background checks for security personnel whose official duties require access to covered weapons at classes of facilities,radioactive material,or other property.

The goals are: support the front line against terrorism; consolidate the government's watchlist into a single watchlist; maintain the Terrorist Watchlist, the No-fly List, and the Selectee List; and protect individual privacy and safeguard civil liberties. The Consolidated Watchlist is the most effective counterterrorism tool for the U.S. Government enabling front-line screening agencies to positively identify suspected terrorist. Thousands of records are updated daily and shared with federal, state, local, territorial, tribal law enforcement, the intelligence community and international partner. The sharing of information ensures that individuals with terrorism links are properly screened and identified; and while identifying potential terrorists, individual privacy rights and civil liberties are maintained. Key customers include: National Counterterrorism Center, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, Department of State, Department of Defense, and Foreign Partners. Stakeholders include: the TSC Nominations and Data Integrity Unit, the Terrorist Screening Operations Center, the Office of Intelligence, the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force, the Special Technologies Applications Section and the Criminal Justice Information Services Division. Encounter Management supports the Consolidated Watchlist by logging and tracking information related to encounters and potential matches against the Watchlist. TSC analysts typically conduct over 1000 daily unique Terrorist Screening System (TSS) transactions that result in the addition, modification, or deletion of KST identities. This screening process is a significant influence to the Nation's counterterrorism initiatives, empowering thousands of law enforcement officers and governmental workers to play an important role in efforts to identify, deter, and capture KSTs. The capability to rapidly modify the TSS enables customers, including the White House, to respond quickly to National Security issues. TSS mitigates the risk of a future terrorist incident.","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime","TSC IT staff continues to manage and provide technical functionality modifications for the TSS. The benefits accrue from identified KSTs; up-to-date national and international no-fly lists; or modified databases from encounter information that results in KST identification or capture. The benefits are based on the number of terrorist encounters and no-fly-list determinations produced and transmitted to U.S. and Foreign Partner Intelligence Organizations in real-time. Specific benefits include: continuous and accurate updates and enhancements to U.S and International No-Fly Lists; complete, timely and accurate encounter terrorist information provided to U.S and International Partners; updates of national and international terrorist databases with encounter information; and accurate screening and adherence to National Privacy Laws and Regulations. 1,000+ daily unique database transactions add, delete, or modify KST identities thus benefiting law enforcement personnel in the field; the personal risk associated with a law enforcement encounter is minimized because accurate, updated terrorist and encounter information is readily available. The terrorist screening process, supported extensively by IT staff, is a significant contributor to U.S. and International counterterrorism initiatives resulting in identification, deterrence and capture of KSTs. Incalculable cost avoidance includes: the cost of the loss of human life; the cost to replace/repair critical U.S. and International infrastructure; the cost to replicate the TSS across all intelligence organizations and the cost of multiple interfaces between organizations to ensure accurate, complete and real-time Law Enforcement information sharing. Additionally, an accurate and real-time no-fly list enables more secure and timely air travel both domestically and internationally; this benefit is not available any other way. Technology is the key enabler in the U.S. fight against terrorism wherever it occurs. The final benefit is the flexibility that TSS provides in response to worldwide terrorist incidents or attacks. Operational priorities change instantaneously when an incident, like the Orlando shooting occurs. The capability to modify priorities, adjust system output, change operational reporting and modify system alerts with foreign partners is invaluable in responding to rapidly changing operational priorities; in some cases priorities emanating from the White House as well as International Partners.","Created by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD-6), the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) consolidates the government's approach to terrorist screening by creating a single comprehensive database of known or reasonably suspected terrorists (KST); to maintain and enhance that database on an ongoing operational basis; and to make this consolidated list available to federal, state and local screeners through the TSC call center on a 7-day 24-hour basis.

AMS is a strategic program that delivers improved customer support for managing taxpayer accounts by leveraging existing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applications. As part of the 2006 Modernization Vision and Strategy process, IRS developed a strategy to use, retain, and provide real-time access to account data regardless of location in the current processing environment (CPE) or modernized data sources. Using a phased release strategy, AMS was able to validate this approach during its initial deployment in October 2007 using a service-oriented architecture implementation to access both CPE and Customer Account Data Engine (CADE). In 2009 the Desktop Integration (DI) system was integrated into AMS and the Correspondence Imaging System (CIS) became an inventory within AMS. AMS was fully deployed in December 2010 and is now in the Operations and Maintenance phase. 

AMS provides multiple systems interfaces using only one computer terminal. The AMS application provides IRS employees the ability to access and update taxpayer accounts quickly, provides data presentation services to display and validate changes/updates for taxpayer accounts, facilitates management actions/activities (such as work assignments, transfers, case creation and closures, and generation of letters to taxpayer) and making case information readily available for decision making and reporting, provides the front-end applications for adjustments, penalties, interest, abatements, credit and debit transfers, name and address changes, bankruptcies, installments agreements, changes to the automated treatment streams and many other taxpayer account-related functions required for customer service and compliance.

It is a shared service provider.  The Federal Reserve Bank, Treasury's fiscal agent (12 U.S.C. 391), develops and operates ASAP under Fiscal Service's direction.  For FY 2018, ASAP ended with 17,464 active users and payments totaling $584 billion (FY ending 9/30/2018). 

Primary beneficiaries of the investment include states, Financial Institutions, Universities, Non- and For-profit organizations, Indian tribal organizations, Federal Program Agencies (FPAs) and the Fiscal Service.  As stakeholders, users receive direct benefit from using the system for payment and/or reporting/information services. 

ASAP supports the Fiscal Service, Treasury, and user FPAs' abilities to exercise sound financial management practices and controls.  ASAP's primary function is to make payments electronically via Automated Clearing House (ACH) and Fedwire.  Its real-time interface with these systems provides next-day and same-day payments to recipients as well as provides immediate financial information to recipients, FPAs and Treasury, to enable informed decision making.

ASAP supports grant payment needs of FPAs through account management features that address federal cash management regulations such as the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, and Public Law 106-107 (Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999).  FPAs streamline the administration of grant payment processing by using ASAP’s business processes and cash management functions. 

ASAP was selected by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Council as one of two approved grant payment systems.   Design efficiencies and robust functionality eliminates the need for redundant payment systems.

The investment represents the primary IT investment that directly supports FinCEN's mission to safeguard the financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering and promote national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and strategic use of financial authorities. FinCEN's mission supports Treasury's strategic goal to protect our national security through targeted financial actions. To successfully fulfill its mission, FinCEN relies on secure, advanced IT to manage the collection, processing, storage, analysis and dissemination of BSA information that contributes to the soundness of, and confidence in, America's financial system. FinCEN is the administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act, which allows stakeholders to combine this financial intelligence information with other sources to address issues related to achieving economic and financial stability and combating terrorist financing. 

Prior to the four-year development effort that was completed in FY 2014, FinCEN faced the challenge of enabling easier compliance and streamlining BSA information capture for its financial community stakeholders, while maximizing the value and impact of BSA information for its regulators, law enforcement, and intelligence community stakeholders. This investment addressed these challenges by providing a comprehensive technical architecture and an enterprise-wide information management and analysis framework that equips law enforcement and financial industry regulators with better decision-making abilities and increased value of BSA information through enhanced data integrity and analytical tools. This allows law enforcement and regulators to focus their limited resources on the areas of shifting illicit criminal activities and vulnerabilities affecting the soundness and stability of the U.S. financial system. In addition, the BSA IT Modernization investment enables easier compliance and streamlines BSA information capture for FinCEN's financial community through its enhancement of electronic filing systems, standardization of financial data with existing standards, and more timely and useful feedback on BSA information filings and the use of BSA information.","015SO18111 - Financial Sector Critical Infrastructure and Cybersecurity: Enhance security, improve resiliency, and reduce the risk of significant cybersecurity and other incidents to the financial sector's critical infrastructure, domestically and internationally, 015SO18112 - Strategic Threat Disruption: Identify, disrupt, and dismantle priority threats to the U.S. and international financial systems., 015SO18113 - Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism Framework: Identify and reduce vulnerabilities in the U.S. and international financial system to prevent abuse by illicit actors., 015SO18115 - Financial Data Access and Use: Increase the access and use of federal financial data to strengthen government-wide decision-making, transparency, and accountability.","The BSA IT Modernization Investment supports FinCEN's modernized technical environment, which leverages state-of-the-art technology and is maintained at a government co-located site, supporting Treasury's data center consolidation efforts. Since FinCEN chose to build a new systems environment using government-owned assets as its alternative, the return on investment (ROI) primarily reflects qualitative benefits, although some quantitative, estimated benefits do apply. As a result, in 2012, FinCEN successfully assumed all system ownership responsibility from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), thus significantly reducing the IRS's operations and maintenance costs. In addition, the program has allowed FinCEN to mandate electronic filing for all Title 31 reports, and FinCEN now averages a receipt of 98 percent of BSA filings electronically. This effort has reduced paper processing and offered Treasury an annual savings of $8-$12 million. 

The BSA IT Modernization investment provides FinCEN greater flexibility and the ability to more quickly respond to its stakeholders' demands. The modernized infrastructure maintains more effective data security and audit technologies, including two-factor authentication, to maximize BSA data confidentiality and integrity. For example, it has improved time to respond to changes by reducing the number of work days required to develop and implement moderate impact changes to its BSA reports. In the area of data analysis, FinCEN has introduced more sophisticated web-based, analytical tools to its users. This improves the value of BSA information to law enforcement agencies and regulators by delivering data to its customers in a more timely fashion. FinCEN continues to provide data to its users in less than 48 hour from receipt. The bureau's capacity to proactively identify trends and patterns in the data has been improved, and sharing of analytical products assists law enforcement in enhancing their anti-money laundering strategies.","There are no specific requirements resulting from outstanding audit findings or material weaknesses, Presidential Directives, or legislative mandates.",no,no,yes,www.fincen.gov|https://cpic.max.gov/|http://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/main.html|https://bsa.fincen.gov,,"Michele Silver","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",216.044000,21.616000,33.843000,35.309000,2010,2023,"PY  to CY changes are due to adjustments in FTE costs based on the introduction of the Standard Investment for IT Management, as well as the inclusion of ""carryover"" of multi-years funds available to spend and the estimated amount to be obligated in CY19.","1 - continue as is",4,"Overall schedule variance for BSA IT MOD is 0.82% and the investment’s overall operational metric variance (OMV) at 45.85% and cost variance remains $0 or 0%.",Green,0,"2019-03-27 18:54:33","2019-03-27 18:54:33",14,"2018-11-02 16:58:35","2019-03-27 18:54:33","2019-03-27 18:54:33",Current,"2018-11-02 16:58:35","2019-03-27 18:54:33",2020,"2009-06-30 00:00:00","2019-03-01 20:41:33","2009-06-30 00:00:00"

The Program will implement a single, data-centric solution which provides daily processing of taxpayer accounts and addresses financial material weaknesses (FMW) to maintain IRS's clean audit opinion.

CADE 2 was chartered in 2009 to provide 21st century technology and digital services to the taxpayer and to IRS employees. The CADE 2 solution includes an authoritative database for individual taxpayer data that will transform the way the IRS approaches tax administration. In addition, CADE 2 will improve the rates by which we process data by reducing the latency associated with antiquated technology. CADE 2 goals are to 1) establish one authoritative source for taxpayer data by leveraging a relational database and daily processing capability; 2) continue IT modernization efforts so business processes can be realigned to enable better taxpayer service and more timely compliance; 3) address the Unpaid Assessment FMW (downgraded to a Significant Deficiency in 2018), demonstrate compliance with Federal Financial Management System Requirements, maintain a clean audit opinion; and 4) improve security and privacy posture by addressing identified weaknesses.

CADE 2 is progressing through the largest, most critical part of the program, Transition State (TS2). Two initial goals of TS2 (establishing the CADE 2 database as the authoritative data source for financial and legal purposes and addressing the Unpaid Assessment FMW) were moved to the Target State due to recent program planning decisions and budget reductions. All available resources are now directed to the most critical goal of reengineering the IMF core components, which is prioritized due to its complexity and reliance on dwindling subject matter experts. 

Target State will complete the reengineering of the legacy IMF architecture by updating upstream/downstream technology and focus on business process alignment. In the target state environment, the current individual taxpayer account system will be retired; future capabilities will enable visibility and access to taxpayer account detail on a near real-time basis.","015SO18104 - Tax Law Implementation: Administer tax law to better enable all taxpayers to meet their obligations, while protecting the integrity of the tax system.","With CADE 2, the IRS will modernize its tax processing capabilities. The Return on Investment (ROI) is being realized incrementally as each piece of functionality within the transition states is deployed. There are many internal and external expected benefits of the program for both the taxpayer and the IRS. 

Taxpayer benefits are already being realized. Taxpayers continue to receive timely refunds in accordance with our daily processing efforts. As of February 8, 2019 (Filing Season 2019), CADE 2/IMF Daily Processing posted nearly 27 million tax returns and issued more than 11 million refunds totaling over $22 billion. Daily processing of data allows taxpayers to address issues closer to the event that generated the notice. Thus, taxpayer issues are more efficiently resolved because account information is available to IRS Customer Service Representatives faster. Additional taxpayer benefits include: reduced taxpayer burden to make compliance easier by enabling self-service tools and real-time access to account information; better access to data and analytical tools by leveraging a relational database, which provides more granular, historic and timely data, and increases the IRS's ability to analyze, research, and respond to fraud and identity theft. Work is aligned around data, not forms, to manage U.S. taxpayers' dollars, track taxpayer relationships, and store and report on more accurate account balances. 

Benefits to the IRS include: increased agility of response to changing taxpayer priorities and legislation; reduced IT costs and complexity; reduced workforce risk; enhanced analytics and reporting to greatly improve compliance and issue resolution; and reduced burden of manually intensive processes on IRS employees, by enabling automated calculations that currently are not possible; addressing the Unpaid Assessments FMW, retaining the clean audit opinion, complying with FFMSR.","The CADE 2 Program is primarily focused on modernizing the IMF as reflected in the Release Plan v5.0.

The Debit Gateway is designed to implement an enterprise architecture goal of having one (and only one) system per Fiscal Service business line. In this case, the business line is the settlement of electronic check and ACH debit transactions received via the collection channels on behalf of federal agencies, as opposed to each channel needing to provide settlement individually. 

The Debit Gateway benefits the Fiscal Service's mission of providing financial services, because a large portion of the government's revenue is received through this application. In addition, the Debit Gateway replaced a number of unnecessarily duplicative solutions in favor of a single, dedicated application for this business line. Also, the Debit Gateway benefits the Fiscal Service's mission of providing financial services to a large number of government agencies in an efficient and cost effective manner thus eliminating the need for redundant check/ACH clearing services offered by Financial Agents. 

Currently, the Debit Gateway processes transactions on behalf of multiple Fiscal Service collection channel applications: Pay.gov, OTCnet, Electronic Check Processing (ECP), and Agency Direct.","015SO18117 - Federal Financial Performance: Improve federal financial management performance using innovative practices to support effective government.","Debit Gateway life cycle benefits are based on the historically-observed unit cost for processing collection transactions through multiple predecessor systems versus the unit cost of processing through the Debit Gateway.  The cost avoidance realized by processing through one system, the Debit Gateway is projected to yield a return on investment of 13.01 percent over the period FY 2018 through FY 2022.
Enhancements to the Debit Gateway have made the program more efficient driving down the unit cost per transaction. The unit cost has gone from $.11 in 2011 to $.025 in 2018. The most recent alternatives analysis looked at the following: continuing with the vendor Debit Gateway was using for core support, moving support to Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC), or using a third party vendor for support. The results of the analysis were to move to FRBC. The recommended alternative will result in a five year cost savings of approximately $1 million compared to the status quo and will significantly reduce operating risk while maintaining the current level of technical capabilities.

EFTPS is managed by a designated Treasury Financial Agent (TFA), pursuant to the authority delegated to the Fiscal Service by the Secretary of the Treasury to designate Financial Institutions to provide banking services to the federal government (12 U.S.C. 90 and 265).  This multi-function investment directly supports the government-wide financial management mission of the Fiscal Service, and is a partnership program with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 

The primary justifications for investing in EFTPS are the following:
- Maximize the percentage of tax collections received electronically by the federal government
- Minimize the amount of time for taxpayers to complete a tax payment using electronic payments 
- Reduce the government cost to process a federal tax - provide a 24 x 7 x 365 mechanism to collect federal tax revenue
 
The Fiscal Service has been given authority for a Permanent and Indefinite appropriation from Congress as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Pub. L 108-199) to perform critical banking services on behalf of the federal government, including for the purposes of tax collection for FY 2004 and beyond.  Funds for this investment are allocated from this authority and are submitted to OMB on an annual basis as part of the congressional justification for the President's Budget.  EFTPS has been in existence since the FY 1996 appropriations to cover the operations and maintenance of the following critical functions:

- Tax payment processing; 
- Fulfillment/mail services;
- Customer service; and

It is one of four federal OPM HR Lines of Business providing HR services to the federal government. HRConnect is based on a combination of (a) web-based solution built on PeopleSoft commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, (b) Software as a Service (Saas) platforms (e.g. Talent Management and Career Connector) and (c) internally developed applications (e.g. Entrance on Duty System). HRConnect transforms core back-office HR functions, moving them from a processing-centric capability to a strategic-centric capability enabled through its commercial software underpinning. Additionally, self-service components of the software fundamentally transform the standard government HR service delivery model, putting additional information, services and processes (i.e., personal data, position management, requests for personnel action, recruitment, reporting, etc.) directly in the hands of managers and employees.

HRConnect supports the common HR Line of Business processes and provides core HR functionality that is interoperable, portable and scalable. This shared solution provides automated systems that are configurable to the individual organizations' needs while providing a single solution across the Department and federal landscape. HRConnect's core functions include: Personnel Action Processing, Managing Payroll, Administering Benefits, Time and Attendance and Labor Distribution. By enabling the retirement of legacy systems and automating and streamlining many aspects of human resources, HRConnect facilitates increased efficiency and overall productivity for its customers. HRConnect is the system used by all Treasury bureaus and several other government agencies (over 22 entities) with over 200,000 employees and contractors in total.","015SO18118 - Workforce Management: Foster a culture of innovation to hire, engage, develop, and optimize a diverse workforce with the competencies necessary to accomplish our mission, 015SO18119 - Treasury Infrastructure: Better enable mission delivery by improving the reliability, security, and resiliency of Treasury's infrastructure.","The return on investment (ROI) for HRConnect is 140%, which is based on cost-benefits calculations for new HRConnect customers. The Department of Labor calculated in FY 2013 $93 million in cost savings in avoidance over six years based on not maintaining and operating independent systems. USAID calculated it would save $22 million in cost savings over four years by transitioning from a mostly paper-based system to HRConnect. The Department of Commerce calculated that it would save over $50 million over four years by transitioning from a paper-based process to HRConnect.

The primary benefits defined for ICCE are due to productivity improvement in the cost per taxpayer contact. Currently, the toll-free phone service and internet inquiry features create significant savings of over $400 million per year when compared to the cost of live Customer Service Representative (CSR) handling.

Estimates show a cost of approximately $0.71 per completed toll-free automated call. The cost is ~$70/hr. (loaded cost) for live Customer Service Representative and a cost of $0.21 per web inquiry compared to the cost of CSR's. 

The ICCE Alternatives Analysis estimates benefits for FY 2019, (mainly from Productivity Improvement) at $558 million. This high cost estimate for productivity improvement derives from the 24x7 availability of the internet compared to what the same service would cost if provided by CSRs working approximately 4.2 shifts per week, including extra compensation for overtime, weekends and holidays. The estimate also includes the cost of the additional overhead involved in supervision, building maintenance, security, insurance and all other ancillary expenditures required for continuous customer service provided by a workforce.

The Knowledge Portal establishes and manages a central content database for secure access to Government off the Shelf (GOTS) content for use by agencies. The LMC investment has a partnership arrangement with Department of Defense s (DoD) Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Co-Lab which provides LMC the ability to leverage DoD s Research and Development (R&D) investments and cross-service collaboration.  The collaboration provides assistance to LMC in developing learning technology standards and frameworks as well as implementing secure next generation learning technologies (mobile, immersive, virtual worlds, and social networking).  LMC uses FISMA compliant dedicated learning management services (LMS) hosting services which have independent IT Security oversight.

As a Center of Excellence for Online Education & Training, LMC assists agencies in meeting Government-wide employee mandatory and specialized education and training requirements using a Software as a Services (SaaS) model.

These business lines are developed to provide learning and training solutions to Federal agencies.  Agencies have a choice when seeking learning management solutions.  They can build in-house learning systems or use an in-house manual training process; purchase a public-or private-sector learning management system; or partner with another Federal agency or Shared Service Center to conduct learning management services for them. 

Agencies purchase LMC solutions via authority of the Revolving Fund:
   -  5 USC 1304 (e)(1) which authorizes the establishment of a revolving fund without fiscal year limitation for financing investigations, training and such other functions as the Office is authorized or required to perform on a reimbursable basis, including personnel management services performed at the request of individual agencies.
   -  5 USC 4116 which directs that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), on request of an agency, shall advise and assist in the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the training programs and plans of the agency under this chapter, to the extent of its facilities and personnel available for that purpose. 

USALearning  fulfills its mission via two openly competed small business single award integrators to procure optimal integrated solutions:
   -  Learning Management Systems (LMS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) contract awarded in 2015 to replace the original GoLearn contract vehicle with a $168 Million ceiling over 5 years
   -  Knowledge Portal Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract allows USALearning  to be system and software solution agnostic to configure, implement, and integrate proprietary and open-source interoperable solutions through custom software engineering.

The LMC program is a cost reimbursable entity and sustains its operation via a fee for service structure.  The respective business lines charge a flat fee (10% or 15%) of the contracted costs to cover program salaries, supplies, travel, IT Security Support and any OPM incurred common service charges. The objective annually is to be cost-recoverable.  All earned revenue over cost (EROC) is rolled back into product and program improvements and to maintain resource flexibility for surge engagements.","The E-Government Act of 2002 (eGov) serves as a Federal legislative vehicle to guide evolving Federal IT management practices and to promote initiatives to make government information and services available online.

In a multi-phase effort, the existing DOE Germantown Data Center will be migrated to a cloud service. Phase I will consist of porting systems from AIX to LINUX. Phase II will include migrating to a cloud service provider.
Front-end budget formulation functions will be integrated into the STARS Oracle eBusiness Suite. This corporate solution will replace legacy systems and Excel spreadsheets in use today and will allow budgets to be formulated from the bottom up across the enterprise in a standard framework. Future efforts may include development of a project cost accounting framework and system. This investment will continue to achieve its objectives which were derived from the DOE Strategic Plan and various OMB guidance: expand business process improvement services; transition from data reporting to business analytics; and proactively analyze, manage and control enterprise resource risks.
In addition to the Department s financial, procurement and human capital communities, Departmental leadership and external entities (OMB, Congress, auditors etc) are consumers of this data.","0 - Not Applicable","According to the Alternatives Analysis, the investment's ROI was projected at 65% with a payback period of 3 years.

IPABS is a custom built application that allows for the collection of this required data

Investments Goals: The goal of IPABS is to collect and report accurate project management data to Congress, EM Senior Management, and the public to prove that cleanup progress is being made and to justify further funding to complete work in order to meet state and federal regulations.

Current Benefits: The data collected through IPABS is used by Congress and Federal auditors to ensure that the cleanup efforts are on track, on budget, and properly managed.  Funding is also needed to support the ever changing business rules on how to collect and report data to EM and Congress and to stay compliant with IT infrastructure, database, and web coding standards.

Anticipated Benefits: The benefits of continued funding of the IPABS investment are realized on a yearly basis through accurate budget reporting, planning activities, and providing the best data possible to Headquarters, the Congressional Budget Report, and the public at large.  

Specific Contribution to Mission Delivery/Agency Management Support Functions:  IPABS-IS is the web-based IT system of record in collection of EM Performance Metrics, Earned Value Management, Milestones, Cost, and Environmental Management data related to the cleanup efforts. EM maintains the core operating and new development functions of IPABS-IS, in order to collect and report the data maintained within in a secure database and infrastructure environment.  Additionally, EM provides analytical support for IPABS-IS, which includes report generation, data review, quality assurance, and the IPABS Help Desk that aids system users. 

Identify Key Customers, Stakeholders, and other Beneficiaries: Congress, the public, DOE EM HQ, DOE EM sites.

Impact:  If the IPABS-IS investment is not fully funded,  Sites across the country linked to the IPABS system would not be able to fully and accurately report planning, budget, and execution data used to report progress to Headquarters, the public, and Congress.  In addition, the system would not be able to stay compliant with coding standards as well as the dynamic business rules required to collect the data.","0 - Not Applicable","Return on Investment (ROI) was completely established when departmental data required to be reported to Congress, EM Senior Management, and the public was collected and stored in a secure database.  Before IPABS, data was collected by the sites through an excel spreadsheet and sent in to HQ to be combined and reported.  IPABS provides a single hub where data can be securely collected and managed before disposition to external stakeholders.  Through configuration control and database audits, EM has had a clean IT audit for the past 8+ years mandated by the Federal Government and has passed the KPMG environmental liability audit since the inception of the Cost and Environmental Liability modules.  As business requirements came to fruition such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and the Capital/Operations split, IPABS's customizable application has been able to evolve with the collection and reporting standards to meet federal mandates.  Although IPABS currently exists at steady state, the investment plans on major updates to the system to evolve to new federal mandates after the Presidential election.  Until then, it is pertinent that IPABS remains agile and meets the standards of the security of the database as well as evolving database and web coding standards.","Environmental Liability Audit -- Every year, EM goes through an external, independent audit of Lifecycle costs being reported for the current Fiscal Year (FY) and out year targets.

While Alternative 1.2 maintains the current SI support services, the cost of DME services will increase by an estimated $17 million across the remaining lifecycle of the Project (beginning FY 2012 thru July 2018). The reason for the increased cost is
based on new initiatives and activities planned under the revised CBIS Vision and Roadmap (September 2011).
O&M costs for Alternative 1.2, will decline drastically as a result of estimated 20% budget reduction from FY2012 thru FY2014; however, while the reductions continue into FY2015, the percentage is reduced to 10% (from FY2015 through the end of the lifecycle   July 2018).

HRLOB worked with OPM policy owners, SSPs, and agencies to ensure successful roll out of the Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act, Telework Data Collection Automation, and Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees Automation. HRLOB established the operating framework for defining the first version of the Permanent Digital Employee Record and the HC Data Dictionary. HRLOB led a cross-agency HC performance measurement collaboration initiative engaging representatives from Mission-Support Benchmarking, HR Stat, ProviderStat, and Unlock Talent programs to create a common understanding of HC measurement, reduce duplication, and improve the information provided to leadership. The HRLOB has also supported SBA and ABMC; in their HR migrations to an approved HRLOB Shared Service Center (SSC).

The National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) is directly responsible for providing effective, efficient, and secure background investigations to establish suitability and ultimately make security clearance determinations for Federal employees and contractors. NBIB is partnered with the CIO s Information Technology Program Management Office (ITPMO) which designs, develops, operates, and maintains a series of Information Technology (IT) systems on behalf of NBIB.  These systems include a variety of technologies including mainframe, distributed and browser-based systems, local applications, and networking and data center support in order to ensure the success of OPM s mission to provide investigative services that meet critical government-wide needs. 

This investment ensures that NBIB provides its Federal customers with the most secure, timely, and accurate details and summarization of their applicant s information.  Specifically, this investment reflects the requirement for continuous modernization of the capabilities and security capabilities of the investigative IT environment.  Information is becoming more and more available from online sources which shift the burden from the field agent to the OPM investigative systems.  The information required for the processing of clearances also changes as analysis of past and present trends indicate.  Security requirements are continuously evolving as new threats emerge.  This requires a robust, modular, and flexible IT environment that can be programmed, interfaced, or configured to meet the ever increasing changes to the available information and sources as well as emerging requirements from the community.

This investment ensures that NBIB provides its Federal customers with the most secure, timely, and accurate details and summarization of their applicant s information.  Specifically, it reflects the full life cycle requirement to ensure the systems are secure and available 24x7x365.  The major components of the NBIB IT environment are: 1.

Over time, OMB has expanded its use to monitor Agency compliance with a growing number of administrative initiatives related to Federal real property. Most recently this includes the issuance of the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) and Federal Property Management Reform Act of 2016.

GSA/OGP's mission is to ensure Federal compliance with existing policies and laws. The FRPP MS serves as an essential tool in contributing to the Administration's goals by assisting our customers and stakeholders:  

1) improve decision-making as a result of more accurate and reliable data.
2) benchmark Federal real property assets.
3) enable Federal agencies to measure real property asset performance.
4) identify assets for renovation, disposal or potential transfer to other Federal agencies.
5) track RTF progress against established baselines.

To further improve upon GSAs mission of promoting improved asset management practices across the federal government, the Federal Real Property Gateway (FRPG) was launched in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 as a one-stop source for federal real property news and information.  The FRPG informs our customer agencies of current federal real property activities, shares policy news, supports collaboration, provides a secure area for FRPC members to share internal documentation and ideas, and hosts federal real property policies and best practices.

With the enactment of the two Federal Real Property Reform bills identified above, additional data will be collected and provided to OMB for their use in making recommendations to the Federal Real Property Reform Board.  A publically accessible database will also be developed and maintained.

The key customers, stakeholders and beneficiaries of this investment are OMB, Congress, and the Federal agencies.","023SO18142 - Reduce the cost of Federal inventory, 023SO18151 - Promote adoption of shared services by agencies through policy, guidance, and benchmarking","Programmatically, this investment's Return on Investment (ROI) is primarily qualitative in nature; however, quantitative benefits are anticipated as unneeded/underutilized assets are disposed of or transferred to other Federal agencies or entities.  The FRPP MS was created to serve as the government's only centralized Federal real property inventory system.  By collecting key data in one location, it has provided the groundwork for a more strategic approach to Federal real property asset management and continues to do so, as new Administrative priorities are developed.  OMB, Congress and Federal agencies all use the data reported to the FRPP MS as a tool to measure asset performance, compare and benchmark across various types of real property assets, and prioritize assets for disposal, renovation or transfer.  It plays a critical role in monitoring agency compliance with The National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and its accompanying Reduce the Footprint Policy (March 25, 2015), which clarified existing policy to dispose of excess properties and promote more efficient use of real property assets.  It will do the same for FASTA and the Federal Real Property Reform Act.  GSA supports the implementation of these policies and laws through data management and analytics to help agencies identify real property efficiency opportunities.

From an IT standpoint, migration of the FRPP MS from Oracle to Salesforce in 2015 resulted in cost savings/avoidance beginning as early as 2016. To date, in FY 2018, this investment has realized $1.082M in cost avoidance and has a projected FY 2019 cost avoidance of $2.092M.","Public Law (P.L.) 115-141 Section 608,  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018,  requires that GSA conduct an additional data collection in January 2019 to incorporate recommended criteria that would make Federal real property capable of supporting communications facility installations, as deemed appropriate by the Administrator, for inclusion in the database established under section 21 of the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (40 U.S.C. 1303 note), as amended by subsection (a) of this section (ie. FRPP MS).

P.L. 114-318, ""Federal Property Management Reform Act of 2016,"" was enacted to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government in managing property of the Federal Government.

The goal of the IAE program is to integrate and unify the federal acquisition process for government buyers and sellers.

IAE is working toward the established product vision of the new SAM.gov, which is to be the trusted, essential place to seamlessly connect to the business of Government. In this effort, the program is developing an evolving set of functional capabilities to replace all ten legacy systems currently used to administer federal awards. Functionalities of the current IAE systems are being IAE s primary goal is to simplify it for users to make, receive, and manage federal awards. The modernized system will have one home page with a single sign-on, one powerful search tool, and one robust reporting tool. The new system will also have one workspace where users can access the information and tools converted into a common, cloud-based, secure business environment. These changes facilitate and support cost-effective acquisition for products and services, as well as fosters the transparent and effective management of federal acquisition and assistance awards they need to make, receive, and manage federal awards. The modernized effort will provide a centralized administration, meaning administrators for multiple IAE systems will no longer be required to log into different systems to make administrative changes.

In developing the final product, the program launched beta.sam.gov to allow for more timely bug fixes and feedback from the user community. IAE continues to work closely with cross-government governance committees and sponsors, providing regular updates and input. The program will decommission systems as approved by the governance committees when all necessary functionality is transferred from the beta testing site. The current systems will remain the authoritative source until decommissioning is approved and properly communicated. The first system to be decommissioned was the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance in FY 2018 with plans to decommission Wage Determinations OnLine webpage in FY 2019. Once all ten systems are migrated over and decommissioned, the system will be renamed to SAM.gov.","023SO18145 - Make it easier to do business with the Government by simplifying processes and streamlining access for our customers and suppliers., 023SO18148 - Drive more efficient and innovative Government procurement of technology services., 023SO18150 - Develop new organizational capabilities to understand customer demand and deliver integrated offerings to support common business processes Governmentwide.","IAE currently manages 10 Federal Systems in support of conducting business with the Government for both the Federal and Non-Federal users.  After consultation with the stakeholders of the current systems, it was determined the current systems do not meet the stakeholder s requirements and pose a business risk to the Government. This conclusion is supported as the current systems are on outdated hardware based platforms.  The code is owned by the managing vendors which creates a potential for functionality issues with the systems or loss of service if the vendor no longer permitted to do business with the Government.   

The new approach, bringing 10 Federal Systems onto a cloud based platform as one system with all mandatory functionality,  will open a single portal, supported by Single Sign On (SSO)  for all Federal and Non-Federal users to conduct business and allow for improvements as identified by Stakeholders to conduct their responsibilities  more efficiently, responsibly, and at fair and reasonable pricing to both the Government and vendor community.  In order to achieve the end result, IAE is operating in SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework).

The current path for modernization has been vetted and approved by OMB and the four governance committees.  Funds will be used to continue the modernization effort and will allow the program to gradually decommission legacy systems, with governance feedback and approval, and have the SAM.gov(beta.SAM.gov until legacy SAM.gov is officially decommissioned) be the all encompassing system of record for the previous legacy systems.","CFDA -- Pub.

This initiative aligns and supports the larger mission delivery goals and objectives for the Department of “Mature and Strengthen the Homeland Security Enterprise” and the DHS OCFO goal of “Revolutionize CFO business practices and systems to enable proactive decision support”. This FSM initiative is Department-wide and consists of multiple Component-level FSM initiatives. The FSM Trio program continues the FSM initiative for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD, formerly DNDO), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and United States Coast Guards (USCG). The goal of the FSM Trio program is to obtain Financial System Modernization Solution (FSMS) with fully integrated financial, procurement, and asset management functions to improve operational performance, reduce and/or eliminate material weaknesses, implement standardized business processes, improve financial operations, enforce data integrity, provide financial transparency, and a single solution of cradle-to-grave contracting for all acquisitions, and ensure compliance with federal laws, regulations, guidelines, and requirements. This will replace the Core Accounting System (CAS) functionality, which is now used by the Trio. A modernized financial system delivers a holistic, enterprise-level view of how resources are allocated and spent. Additional benefits include: Replacement of outdated technology; Improvement in audit outcomes and data visibility by enabling financial reporting consistency and eliminating material weaknesses/deficiencies; Enhancement of system performance; Leverage of efficiencies & economies of scale; Optimization of interoperability with improved user interface for accuracy and efficiency; Standardization of business processes and data; Business intelligence and reporting enhancements; Reduction in security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, an ROI cannot yet be calculated and can only be described qualitatively. Due to the obsolescence of the CAS system and the critical gaps needed to overcome, efficiencies will be gained from modernized systems, increased security controls, standardization of business processes, increased business intelligence reporting capabilities, adherence to federal accounting regulations and standards, and reduction in O&M costs compared to the DOI/IBC solution. The Hosting Options Alternative Analysis further outlines that the advantages DHS has gained by choosing to move the DOI/IBC solution to a private cloud in DHS Data Center 2 as the facility already meets USCG DISA Level 4 security requirements, has a vendor with experience migrating systems both in and out of the cloud, which allows for DHS to have greater control in managing costs, schedule, and performance. Additionally, the System Deployment Agent/System Support Agent (SDA/SSA) vendor selected by DHS to resume implementation of TSA and USCG employs a Hybrid Agile approach, which is expected to deliver the largest benefits by demonstrating low costs while simultaneously meeting most of the FSMS’s business needs and minimizing risks.","- Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-10-26, Immediate Review of Financial Systems IT Projects of 28 June 2010 established updated guidelines and policies for the implementation of new financial management systems.

It provides un-interrupted services by phone, email, in person or through the internet to participants whose plans are currently trusteed by PBGC, of which 840,000 retirees or their beneficiaries are receiving benefit payments, totaling more than $5.7 billon. 
 BA systems support over 900 PBGC users at seven locations and around a quarter of a million external users (online users of MyPBA), allowing PBGC users to properly and efficiently service participant needs and allowing participants to directly manage their account information respectively. BA’s modernization plan allows PBGC to increase customer satisfaction, reduce the costs by consolidating applications, provide additional self-service transactions online, and continue to pay pension benefits on time & accurately in ways that maintain high standards of stewardship & accountability. 
  
BCV is PBGC’s pension calculation and valuation solution, used by plan actuaries to determine participant benefits and calculate corporate liabilities for plans PBGC will trustee. The actuarial calculations that the systems perform are essential in determining eligibility and correct benefit amount for participants entering pay status (PBGC currently pays participants approximately $5.7 billion annually).
  
IPVFB calculates and integrates the amounts of future benefits of trusteed pension plans, those considered at ‘high risk’ of being trusteed, and others creating potential liability. As an internal benefit to PBGC, IPVFB supports the multiemployer program through the evaluation of multiemployer plan assets and liabilities, monitors potential errors in the benefit payment database and reporting errors to the case processing staff and produces the Present Value of Future Benefits results that are vital inputs to maintaining the PBGC’s unqualified audit opinion. External benefits include IPVFB’s computation of the present value of future benefits and expenses of PBGC which is used to report to the US Congress annually. Importantly it is a contributing source by which millions of American workers’ pension benefits are secured.  The completion of the modernization project addressed multiple audit findings related to improvements to security controls, the quality of data needed to calculate the corporation’s financial liability, and the replacement of outdated technology.","Legislative Mandate:

DCPS integrates SSA's disability processes, enabling sharing of disability workloads across DD Component sites, providing a common interface with other SSA offices and systems, and dramatically reducing in the technological complexity of system support.  DCPS will provide accurate, current, consistent, and accessible data for national consumption; leading to enhanced anti-fraud efforts, as well as enhancing the agency s IT security posture through greater visibility and accountability.

DCPS encompasses the entire claims process from start to finish, including case processing, correspondence, fiscal, management information, and workload management.  The system will use electronic case analysis to support disability examiners in making consistent decisions based on SSA Disability Policy, and leverage SSA's investment in Intelligent Disability.    It will provide a disability vendor repository that consolidates existing vendor data stores, which can then be utilized by all the disability case processing partners nationwide.  The system will enforce SSA Disability Policy consistency, compliance, and flexibility by enabling policy changes that keep pace with changes in the environment.  Replacing the current DD component systems with DCPS will minimize the average processing time for initial disability claims, decrease case processing-related task time and provide increased system availability to improve the overall quality of the disability determination process. This supports the agency's strategic goal to Improve the Way We Do Business through the strategy to Modernize Disability Case Processing.

In FY18, the collective DCPS team deployed 5 major business-feature releases and numerous maintenance releases into Production; significant milestones that demonstrate the capability of the agency and its vendor partners to develop and deliver modern IT applications.  We have 12 sites using DCPS in production.  We continue to maximize functionality to increase the number of users and volume of cases in the existing states.  We plan to deploy DCPS to the remaining DDSs in 2019 and 2020.","016SO18199 - Accelerate Information Technology Modernization","DCPS will transition the DD components from 52 fragmented, highly customized legacy systems to a common system that uses automated tools and leverages current technology.  No longer maintaining multiple systems, SSA will implement software enhancements and modifications required by laws, regulations, and business rules more efficiently and consistently, and at a reduced overall cost as compared to the current legacy system environment. 

The DCPS operational and technical benefits are outlined in our Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and are explained in detail in our benefit scorecards. The benefits outlined on the scorecards serve as a North Star that we aim for in adding value in the system. The operational benefits included in the CBA drive the operations-centric business case. The following quantitative operational benefits contribute to cost savings and avoidance calculations in the CBA: Automated Case Receipt, Automated Case Assignment, Automated Requests for Information, Automated Consultative Exam (CE) Scheduling, Automated Case Closure, and Central Print. The following quantitative technical benefits contribute to cost savings and avoidance calculations in the CBA: Labor Efficiencies, Reduced Maintenance Costs, Reduced Training Time and Productivity & System Outages.

The benefit of DCPS cannot be measured solely in the form of cost savings or avoidance.  The program identified qualitative benefits for all of the operational and technical quantitative benefits mentioned above as well as for Vendor Data, Case Analysis, Central Third Party Fiscal, Improved Business Intelligence, Integration with Other Initiatives, Central Template Maintenance, Workload Portability, User-Friendly Interface, Workload Sharing, Electronic Fiscal Interface, Outsource Medical Evidence Collection: Third Party MER Intake, Standardized Codes, Communication Between Sites, and Enhanced IT Security.

We have 12 sites (Ohio, Delaware, Maine, Virginia, Iowa, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, Nebraska, Washington, D.C., Missouri, and Vermont) using DCPS in production.  We plan to deploy DCPS to the remaining DDSs in 2019 and 2020.","Disability Case Processing System, in part, specifically address the  Congressional Response Report: Progress in Developing the Disability Case Processing System as of February 2018 .

It manages data retrieved from the Tax Master Files allowing over 60,000 IRS employees who use it daily to take actions on specific taxpayer account issues, track status and post updates back to the Master Files. It provides for systemic review of case status, alleviating staffing needs and providing consistency in case control. For example, each time a taxpayer phones IRS, the person answering the phone uses IDRS to log the call and answer any questions. IDRS issues notices and processes installment agreements, offers in compromise, and adjustments. Actions taken via IDRS include notice issuance, installment agreement processing, offers in compromise, adjustment processing, penalty and interest computations and explanations, credit and debit transfers among accounts and research of taxpayer accounts for problem resolution of taxpayer inquiries. Using data analytics, IDRS enables IRS to efficiently evaluate taxpayer data to inform enforcement and secure legal compliance, both domestically and internationally.

In addition to IRS employees, IRS internet applications depend on IDRS to provide back-end services to enable them to help taxpayers. For example, over 290 million taxpayers ask Where's-my-refund at irs.gov annually and over 4 million business taxpayers obtain Employer Identification Numbers via irs.gov instead of via paper. IDRS enables businesses providing payroll services to submit tax data on behalf of millions of taxpayers and collaborates with registered tax practitioners to reduce the burden of filing Powers of Attorney and Taxpayer Information Authorizations, allowing them to request access to other E-Services. Many kinds of tax information are produced by IDRS to support sending and receiving information to and from other systems within the IRS, SSA, Financial Management Service, State and local governments and tax practitioners.

IDRS is continuously monitored for cost, schedule, and project performance. IDRS serves the taxpayers in many ways and helps address various performance gaps. IDRS' citizen-centered services promote intangible goodwill to citizen's perception of IRS and the Federal Government as well as ensuring consistent, efficient service.","015SO18104 - Tax Law Implementation: Administer tax law to better enable all taxpayers to meet their obligations, while protecting the integrity of the tax system.","In addition to dollar benefits, there are many quantitative and qualitative benefits:
a. As a result of H.R. 5552, Firearms Excise Tax Improvement Act of 2010, legislation changes the way criminal restitution is assessed, allowing IRS to assess and collect restitution as if it were tax.  A new sub-system, Restitution Assessment Project (RAP), was developed and allows employees to create, research, update and delete Restitution Assessment. The Database contains cross-reference information concerning restitution assessments against individuals and businesses. The benefits reduce the amount of adjustments to the financial statement due to duplicate assessments and reporting. Failure to have the ability to view accounts would be a detriment to the IRS's ability to validate and attest that these criminal restitution assessments are collected once as required.
b. IDRS enables IRS to answer the question Where's-my-refund? Over 290 million times each year without assistance of a Federal employee, through www.irs.gov, the IRS2Go smartphone application, and the toll-free telephone number.  IDRS annually enables over four million business taxpayers to obtain Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) via irs.gov instead of paper copies.  
c. IDRS allows users to submit tax data on behalf of millions of taxpayers and collaborates with registered tax practitioners to reduce the burden of filing Powers of Attorney and Taxpayer Information Authorizations, allowing them to request access to other E-Services. Without access to other E-services there would be additional costs to taxpayers and IRS. 
d. IDRS is the only system within IRS that directly services taxpayer accounts in a real-time environment. Each year, Congress passes legislation (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Firearms Excise Tax Improvement Act) that mandates form creation or revision. Without consistent IDRS updates, IRS would not be able to maintain the consistency and integrity of tax cases, which would negatively impact the integrity of the nation's tax system.

Deployed in 2006, CFS integrates three general ledgers; three sub-ledger modules; and related interfaces into a single installation of the Oracle E-Business Suite vR12 which is a COTS application. CFS enables core financial management business processes including financial reporting; general ledger and trusteed plan ledger accounting; investment assets accounting; budget execution funds control; cash management; administrative expense payments (benefit funding, financial assistance, vendor invoicing, payroll, and employee travel and training); and specialized financial reporting for program management decision support. PPS provides the operational infrastructure to support PBGC's premium program including financial reporting, accounting, internal controls, billing and collections of past due premiums, and customer service. PPS consists of two main applications, the Premium Practitioner System (PPS) and the My Plan Administration Account (My PAA). My PAA is a web application Plan Administrators utilize to transmit premium filings and payments to PBGC. PPS receives premium filings and payments from My PAA, processes & posts them to plan accounts, and provides reporting capability. PPS also maintains plan demographic data, performs premium filing validations, calculates penalties and interest, generates billings for premiums in arrears, manages correspondence, documents action items, and reports data used in financial statements.  PPS maintains other essential data for PBGC's insurance program used throughout the Agency. For example, the Office of Negotiations and Restructuring uses the premium filing data in their assessment of PBGC’s insurance risk exposure.   TAS provides the accounting for assets of recently terminated plans held by interim custodian banks and the commingled assets of prior terminations held at PBGC’s custodian bank.  TAS also maintains the financial records for all trusteed plans, which includes accounting for future benefit liability calculated by the Integrated Present Value of Future Benefits (IPVFB) system.","012SO18069 - Improve the security of retirement, health, and other workplace-related benefits for America's workers and their families.","CFS provides PBGC's investment and financial transaction and reporting capabilities of PBGC's financial position, and also facilitates required internal controls to safeguard PBGC's assets.

NIIMS processes approximately $35 million in annual receivables which is the primary revenue source for the O&M of each Project. NIIMS serves the individual congressionally authorized Indian Irrigation Projects which provide O&M services to the water users within their Project. NIIMS efficiently interfaces with the DOI FBMS financial system and U.S. Treasury shared services including Pay.gov and FedDebt to provide complete debt management which supports irrigation project level O&M and construction fiscal requirements in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) of 1996 and Treasury guidance. Centralized collections are standardized, but the rules for billing are complex and vary by irrigation project. The process of billing and rate setting is influenced by treaty obligation, statutory requirements, program policy, growing season, crop values, yields, water supply reliability, and other factors. The end users are Indian irrigation projects that have costs that are reimbursable by the Federal Government. The current NIIMS V1.8 platform is running on a Windows server virtualized private cloud in Albuquerque. The NIIMS application is managed by staff in the Division of Water and Power (DWP), most of whom are located in the BIA Lakewood, CO office. Land Data (TNA, PNA and PA and A, B, C and leasehold) is entered at the project offices by BIA irrigation personnel. NIIMS satisfies requirements from a number of sources such as the Code of Federal Regulations, BIA Manuals/policies, the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, and Treasury guidelines. NIIMS establishes receivables, tracks financial billing and collection information, processes collection actions and posts them against the receivables (approx.15,000 trans-includes 1,300 delinquent bills/$662,000 referred to Treasury), and generates summarized transactions for the FBMS interface daily.

TAAMS is the only system to date that has been able to meet the government's key fractionalization requirement capable of algorithms dividing ownership to 43 places to the right of the decimal. TAAMS supports the management of trust title ownership, encumbrance, and land records through a centralized bureau-wide system. TAAMS also supports Trust Reform goals identified by DOI and BIA in the Cobell vs. Salazar case, as well as multiple strategic goals, including ""honoring trust responsibilities to Indian Tribes."" A performance gap existed before fielding TAAMS. The Land Title and Records Offices (LTROs) could not record title documents, e.g., deeds, leases, probates received from agencies/field offices with the speed required to certify and issue Title Status Reports (TSRs) for agencies to successfully complete trust asset transactions. Before TAAMS, the agency offices manually created and mailed title documents to LTROs, who manually recorded, microfilmed, and entered data into the title system to maintain title documents and chain-of-title to produce TSRs and manually validate its accuracy. The agency and LTRO processes were so time- and labor-intensive that significant backlogs existed for document recording, data entry, and issuance of certified TSRs and probate inventories. TAAMS significantly reduces the amount of time needed to process documents at the agency and LTROs. In TAAMS, title documents are created and entered at the agency and electronically delivered to LTROs via the TAAMS Image Repository where the document is recorded and processed into the land title, and then returned to the agency via the repository. TAAMS closes the gap between manual and automated delivery and processing of title documents and certified land title products and reports. TAAMS expedites the processing of title ownership and the delivery of title documents and certified reports in minutes and hours instead of days and weeks. The Land Buy Back effort (LBB), a result of court settlement, utilizes the data contained in TAAMS to generate purchase offers to Indian beneficiaries. The LBB effort is closely monitored by the courts and Congress, is authorized for a ten year period and relies on the continually updated data contained in TAAMS. Without up to date data, purchase offers could be made to the wrong individual. It is imperative that real time data be utilized.","010SO18241 - Fulfill fiduciary trust","The TAAMS system has allowed the government to retire outdated and unstable Legacy Systems which were in danger of collapsing, combining approximately 15 systems into one, resulting in a substantial cost savings to the government.

The TAAMS system is the cornerstone in fulfilling many of the terms of the Cobell vs. Salazar settlement action, such as the ""Land Buy Back Program for Tribal Nations"" (LBB) effort to consolidate fractional land interests under tribal nations. The LBB effort is authorized for a 10-year period and involves $1.9 billion dollars for use in the compensation of individual Indian land owners. The benefits to Indian beneficiaries is more timely distributions of funding, a more secure repository of individual information, more timely updates on probate actions, resulting in better services to Indian beneficiaries. TAAMS also provides the government with a powerful system flexible enough to deal with the evolving needs of the government and Indian country. The cost of running TAAMS is less than 1% of the dollars running through the TAAMS system.","The Trust Asset Accounting Management System (TAAMS) standardized the business process for the management of trust land assets..  TAAMS consolidated 12 legacy systems, as a result the department has been able to provide an Asset statement to beneficiaries with the data held in TAAMS.  The system was modified in 2013 to comply with the Claims Resettlement Act.  The Land Consolidation program has been successful due to the centralized land and ownership information which is available in TAAMS. As of 08/29/2018 there have been 264,100 of offers set out of which 89,897 have been approved, 768,982 interests in 43,240 tracts have been purchased for a total of $1,274,277,657.

The original project was chartered in October 1992 with initial modules deployed in 1997, and is currently in O&M. A technological refresh (AFMSS-2) was approved by the BLM IT Investment Board (ITIB) in FY14 and is in development (DME).  AFMSS core data includes leases, agreements, wells, production, approvals of operations bond and surety information, and operator compliance.  An MOU between BLM and USDA/Forest Service (USFS) designates AFMSS/WIS (Well Information System) as joint systems under the Energy Act.

The original system is being modernized using business process management (BPM). This will implement standard processes and data as well as increase efficiency and accountability, enabling BLM to process Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs) with target timeframes. Inspections will be automated so inspectors can focus on inspections in the field, greatly increasing productivity. The operator interface (WIS) will be greatly enhanced. The new system's electronic records will be the official source of record and will meet the new requirements of industry and changes in Onshore Orders.

AFMSS supports the mission areas of Resource Protection, Resource Use, and Serving Communities by providing a record of mineral resource use authorizations and I&E activities and information from the Nation's mineral estate cases required to effectively promote/manage resource protection and use.

The funds that used to be accounted for manually are now put under accounting control at the time of receipt providing a complete, detailed audit trail.  CBS has fully automated hundreds of manual or partially automated labor-intensive processes in the field saving BLM over $4.257 million in FY 2012.  

CBS has helped BLM to obtain unqualified audit opinions by providing accountability of funds, security of information, separation of duties, and audit trails of all transactions. BLM management routinely uses CBS reports to make business decisions related to planning, process and systems analysis, cost determination, and risk assessments. CBS has improved BLM's ability to quickly respond to financial legislation and reporting requirements, while adding payment options (cash, credit card, or check) for customers.

CBS has an interdependent relationship with FBMS, Pay.gov, Vantiv Bank, and BLM land resource systems, including Lease and Realty Authorization Module (LRAM), Rangeland Administration System (RAS), Recreation Management Information System (RMIS), Automated Inventory Management System (AIMS), Alaska Land Information System (ALIS), Mining Claims Adjudication (MCII), Legacy Rehost 2000 (LR2000), Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR), Paria Canyon Wilderness Permit System (Paria), Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Permit System (Aravaipa), and Lower Deschutes River Permit System (Boater Pass).

The CBS ROI is based on comparing manual processes with the cost savings of automated processes for a variety of business functions.  Additional qualitative returns include:  assist in producing Unqualified Audit Opinions, providing Internal Controls to Decrease Fraud and Abuse, assist in gathering financial information for data-calls and assist in serial number validations with the Land Records application.  CBS also provides a common gateway that allows BLM to send all their revenue data to FBMS from multiple resource systems.   CBS received payments of approximately $971 million in FY2017, while IT costs were less than $2 million in FY2017.

Benefits:
CBS benefits include helping BLM to obtain unqualified audit opinions by providing accountability of funds, security of information, separation of duties, and audit trails of all transactions. BLM management routinely uses CBS reports to make business decisions related to planning, process and systems analysis, cost determination, and risk assessments. CBS has improved BLM's ability to quickly respond to financial legislation and reporting requirements, while adding payment options (cash, credit card, Automated Clearing House - ACH transactions, or check) for customers.  The funds that used to be accounted for manually, are now put under accounting control at the time of receipt providing a complete, detailed audit trail.  CBS has fully automated hundreds of manual or partially automated labor-intensive processes in the field saving BLM over $5.619 million in FY 2017.  CBS enforces hundreds of unique and specific business rules in compliance with BLM regulations.
Other benefits include the following:
- CBS provides a secure system for collections and billings, that is customer-centric, accurate, timely, and minimizes the opportunities for errors. 
- CBS supports non-financial users who work with bills, collections, payments, receivables, etc., without them being required to know general ledger accounts or basic accounting functions. 
- CBS interfaces to DOI s financial system of record allowing the exchange and posting of collections information to the general ledger.  

Outcomes achieved or planned: 
The number of interfaces between CBS and other BLM systems being maintained has continued to rise, but the cost of operating older technology has increased. CBS is in the process of adding mobile applications offered through Pay.gov that will allow our recreations site greater flexibility and improved customer experience.

These entities include USDA/Forest Service, DOD/US Air Force, DOI (BLM, BIA, FWS, and NPS), and The Nature Conservancy. The IQCS system was built for the creation and delivery of the Incident Qualification Card report.  The report is printed and delivered to the Incident Responder for validation of position requirements for the field.   All of the wildland fire incident response personnel dispatched to every incident are required to have the Incident Qualification Card (also known as the ""Red Card""), on their person when arriving at the dispatched incident.

The federal, state and local government agencies that have incident response program management responsibility including DOI and all of its member agencies and offices, the USDA/Forest Service, and NASF (NWCG member) are all stakeholders in IQCS.  Each of the listed agencies has provided requirements, funding, and personnel to support this program.  

Currently, there are approximately 2,800 registered users in many different roles.  The majority of the users are hands-on account managers.  These account managers manage the qualifications records for 67,000+ incident responders.  The next largest groups of users are the training officers.  The smallest group is the Fire Management Officer, FMO.  In an average month, about 50% of the users will login and utilize the application at least one time.

IQCS provides a common web-enabled, single point of access for all entities that use the system.  IQCS supports the Enterprise Architecture.  IQCS has an interface with another interagency wildland fire system (ROSS) to facilitate interoperability and reduce redundancy. The application requires no more than access to the internet.  Communication to the end-users is primary provided through the website, http://iqcs.nwcg.gov    Information on new functionality, FAQs, and information on business direction is found at this address.  It also provides the access portal to the IQCS secured website.

The IQCS Program information directly supports two of the DOI Government Performance Reporting Act (GPRA) mission areas. IQCS is a mission essential system because it can mitigate the potential for loss of life, personnel injuries and fire management liability.","010SO18255 - Prioritize DOI infrastructure needs and reduce deferred maintenance backlog","Return on Investment (ROI) and costs:
Net Present Value: $12M, Present Value of Costs $18M, Present Value of Benefits $30M, Benefit/Cost Ratio: 1.7  .  Benefit estimates are based on comparing manual processes with the cost savings of automated processes for a variety of business functions.  

Benefits:
IQCS is vital for documenting incident responder qualifications, training, experience and certifications for national emergency response. This helps ensure readiness levels to quickly respond to emergencies.  All wildland fire incident response personnel dispatched to each incident are required to have the Incident Qualification Card (also known as the ""Red Card""), on their person when arriving at the dispatched incident.  This benefits various levels of government and the public impacted by incidents.

IQCS functionality provides the following benefits for end-users:
- currency and certifications for responder personnel
- enter information into the system as opposed to manual, paper-based processes.
- routing, approval processes, and notifications.
- integrate with Resource Ordering and Status System (ROSS) to extract data to use, as well as update source system with modified data from IQCS system if required
- store documents and other artifacts in final and draft states, with accompanying metadata and user access needs
- view static pre-defined reports
- create ad hoc reporting requests

Outcomes achieved or planned: 
The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) sanctioned the IQCS Information Engineering Investment Study that found that multiple redundant systems in the Department of Interior (DOI), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the individual States created inefficiencies and difficulty in tracking Firefighter Qualifications and the dispatch of those Firefighters to incidents. NWCG then chartered the IQCS Acquisition and Design phases with BLM as the lead agency.  There is a monetary benefit by eliminating the cost of maintaining the redundant systems and there is an efficiency benefit because IQCS now provides the functionality of a single interagency application that allows the sharing of emergency responder training and certification data across all involved agencies.  In addition, by continuing to add interagency partners to IQCS there are cost avoidances because the new agencies do not have to develop and maintain their own systems.  The benefits external to the government are directly tied to the success of the Federal fire and emergency response missions which depend on the Incident Qualification and Certification System (IQCS) information. IQCS is a critical function for managing the emergency response and Wildland fire program's risk, primarily in the areas of health, life safety, and legal liability.

RMSS is steady state, however it responds as needed to changing mission needs and technological improvements. More specifically the RMSS investment consists of approx. 80 specialized and unique applications, systems, services and the related IT resources which provide IT support to accomplish Reclamation s WRM mission.  These specialized, often home grown, applications are tailored in design, support, and/or WRM function they provide.  Within RMSS, the IT components (applications, systems and services) are currently being further categorized into the unique WRM business functional areas they support. (e.g. water facilities planning & operations,  water resource development, water resource program management & reporting,  water environmental management, etc.).  All operational, maintenance and life-cycle management expenses of these mission specific RMSS IT components and services are treated as operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Reclamation is responsible for over 75% of all constructed assets of the Water Resource Management (WRM) activity in the Dept of the Interior (DOI). Management of water resources occurs within a complex legal framework of general law and authorities currently incorporating 5,000+ pages of congressional direction. RMSS is critical to Reclamation's mission-related WRM focused work functions that compute, store, access, maintain and back-up mission-specific data for a wide range of functional activities related to water and hydroelectric power management objectives, including planning, environmental programs, and administrative functions. To accomplish these WRM goals and objectives, Reclamation personnel need ready access to both current and historical water management data. They must analyze and summarize data, complete essential operational activities, as well as, prepare reports and presentations which provide meaningful information to citizens, business partners, and other government entities. RSAMS is specifically tailored to support a secure, reliable data repositories, data analysis, reporting capabilities, transactions, and collaborative tools for authorized Reclamation individuals to perform their work functions.","010APG18023 - Water Conservation and Supply Enhancement","RSAMS IT applications, services and resources are unique and customized to provide water resource management IT support services that are not included in any other Reclamation or Department of Interior IT investment.

ANSS provides realtime information on the distribution and intensity of earthquake shaking to emergency responders so that they can rapidly assess the full impact of an earthquake and speed disaster relief to the most heavily affected areas. ANSS also provides engineers with the information they need to improve building design standards and engineering practices to mitigate the impact of earthquakes.

ANSS reduces costs through avoided losses. Average annual earthquake losses in the U.S. are estimated to approach $6 billion per year. Losses are avoided by improved mitigation (a result of more accurate hazard assessments), improved emergency response (a result of more accurate, useful and timely information), and improved awareness and decision-making in both public and private sectors (a result of the availability of accurate, reliable, timely information).

As detailed in a report of the National Academy, strongly supporting the full deployment of ANSS, the beneficiaries are diverse: the public benefits from improved earthquake safety and reduced losses; emergency responders, governments at all levels, and lifeline operators benefit from improved situational awareness following a damaging earthquake; and scientists, engineers and architects benefit from improved data and information about earthquakes and the ground- and structural motions they cause.

The 2013 Science Strategy for the Natural Hazards Mission Area calls for full deployment of the ANSS to improve seismic monitoring of the Nation and the 26 U.S. urban areas at greatest risk from earthquakes.  ANSS is also a top priority of the 4-agency NEHRP (National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program) Strategic Plan and in the Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction Implementation Plan of the NSTC Subcommittee for Disaster Reduction. Its full implementation is a top recommendation of the Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee, which is the FACA advisory committee to the USGS Director for the Earthquake Hazards Program.","010SO18246 - Provide science to safeguard communities from natural hazards","In 2003, the USGS commissioned a study by the National Research Council (NRC) on the economic benefits of improved seismic monitoring. USGS asked the NRC to examine how improved monitoring could reduce future losses and to estimate the benefits that could be realized by the full deployment of the ANSS.  Their 2005 report represents the most rigorous effort ever to examine the costs and benefits of earthquake monitoring, and it clearly justifies the full deployment of ANSS.  
* The potential benefits of improved seismic monitoring far exceed the costs annualized building and building related earthquake losses are estimated to be about $5.6B, whereas the annualized cost of enhanced seismic monitoring is about $96M, less than 2% of the estimated losses.
* The annual dollar costs for improved seismic monitoring are in the tens of millions, but the potential dollar benefits are in the hundreds of millions.
* Seismic monitoring provides the key to understanding how the built environment responds to significant earthquakes, and improved records offer the potential for fine-tuning the design process so that seismic safety requirements are adequately--but not excessively met.
* Earthquake mitigation actions based on improved seismic information and the resulting reduction in uncertainty- would yield benefits many times the cost of seismic monitoring.
* In just one benefit area, performance-based engineering, dollar estimates for benefits are estimated at $142 million annually  about three times the cost of operating the full ANSS.
* In the area of loss estimation modeling, improved monitoring information will greatly reduce uncertainty, potentially decreasing the cost of insurance and reinsurance, and shifting costs from disaster relief payments and grants (publicly financed) to insurance recoveries (financed through premiums).
* Improved seismic monitoring can significantly increase the accuracy of tsunami warnings and reduce the risk of missed warnings or costly false alarms, which constitute 75% of the warnings issued since 1948.
* The U.S. should rank seismic risk reduction as highly as other critical national programs, should track the growth of risk nationally, and should make the necessary long-term investments to reduce it.
* Full deployment of ANSS offers the potential to substantially reduce earthquake losses and their consequences, whereas existing funding levels are insufficient to even maintain present capabilities.","Congress established the ANSS through the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-503), directing the U.

LEO is comprised of three services. Those services include the Virtual Command Center (VCC), Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and the @leo.gov email service.  

VCCs allow users to collaborate and share operational information on subjects and personnel, which include tactical information; investigative updates; GIS mapping data; imagery; operational plans, and warrant information.  The VCC provides a platform for immediate, coordinated decisions.  

SIGs is a controlled-access service, maintained by moderators with an administrative role, to share information with LEEP members. SIGs contains a public area accessible to all LEEP users and the ability to create restricted areas with access granted by the moderator. Information within a SIG may include unclassified intelligence reports, criminal intelligence, officer safety bulletins, relevant data on specific areas of expertise, training materials, and administrative documents,.  

The @leo.gov email service is available to all LEEP users upon request.  @leo.gov email offers secure, trusted government email communication among all users with a criminal justice nexus.

The goal of LEO Services is to facilitate CUI information sharing across jurisdictions for users with a criminal justice mission.  LEO Services provides operational support to major public events and critical incidents as well as warrant sweeps and law enforcement task force operations.  LEO Services facilitates cross-jurisdictional information sharing, providing users with the ability to organize and share the information they need to prevent or mitigate criminal threats to persons, property, and infrastructure. LEO Services  investment supports the FBI s mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States, enabling its users to access, organize, and share, criminal threat information with other criminal justice agencies. LEO Services gives users the ability to share information in a consistent manner, across multiple organizations and systems, to accomplish operational goals and support the mission of the FBI.","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime","This investment achieves its return through continued sharing of resources by all participating agencies and/or users in a cost-effective, secure environment with the stated goal of providing an innovative, information-sharing system.  Some benefits of this investment include: more information available to more users: platform secured to federal standards; local, regional, and state information linked into a national system; improved alliance across government, non-government, and private entities; dynamic provisioning and de-provisioning, and improved security.

The mission is consistent with the OMB Circular A-16, ""Coordination of Surveying, Mapping, and Related Spatial Data Activities."" A-16 requires the USGS to lead the Nation in providing and maintaining a common set of base geographic information and to be the Federal agency leader for elevation, hydrography, orthoimagery, and geographic names. The USGS is providing the national leadership to organize, maintain, publish, and disseminate The National Map, a set of basic geospatial data provided as a variety of products and services. This re-engineering project incorporates the IT efforts required to provide a more efficient and automated capability for meeting this mission. The investment includes the systems for distribution for digital Geographic Information System (GIS) data, and updated, printable topographic maps (US Topos). These system improvements enable the automation of map production and product delivery to meet the goal of producing updated US Topo maps for the CONUS on a three-year cycle. It took ~ 3,000 people over 55 years to do a once over complete coverage of the continental US. Now it is being updated every 3 years by about 300 people through the use of enhanced system automation processes. TNM supports National Critical Infrastructure assets by being the (1) guarantor of national data completeness, consistency, and accuracy, (2) catalyst and collaborator for creating and stimulating partnerships, (3) integrator and certifier of basic geospatial data from other participants, (4) owner and data producer of content for The National Map when no other suitable and verifiable source for those data exists, and (5) leader in the development and implementation of national geospatial data standards. The Mapping Sciences Committee of the National Research Council conducted an in-depth independent review of The National Map concept (Weaving a National Map, The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2003). The study findings and review comments, have all directed the USGS to pursue the vision of The National Map as a worthwhile, justified, and timely alternative to the current national mapping program status quo. The Mapping Sciences Committee concludes that ""if successful, the program will have great benefits to the nation"".","010SO18229 - Utilize science in land, water, species and habitat management supporting decisions and activities, 010SO18232 - Inform land use planning processes especially for public use and access","The National Map Cost Benefit study identified three major critical variables:
 	Average change in the net benefit of an application implementation as a result of data from The National Map.
 	Rate of innovation of new applications.
 	Amount of cumulative diffusion of data from The National Map and of the new and existing applications those data can inform.

From the time that this Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was written, National Map data has been used in many more applications than imagined.  With the advent of Google Maps, Bing Maps, ESRI Web Maps, Open Street Map and many others, all of whom use some data from The National Map in their maps, our data has been leveraged both internally and externally to the government in many way that demonstrate a very high estimated ROI.

As an example, The Boston Consulting Group recently completed a study commissioned by Google entitled:  Geospatial Services:  A $1.6 Trillion Growth Engine for the US Economy   (BCG report, June 2012) http://www.bcg.com/documents/file109372.pdf.  This study stated that  Growth depends on continued Government  Private sector partnership and cooperation .  Data from the National Map is a key example of government-private sector geospatial partnerships.  The fact that National Map data is open, publically available, data has allowed its ubiquitous reuse across the web in applications, in geospatial analysis, and in derivative map production.  In fact, chances are any web map a user views over the US that involves elevation, hydrography, geographic names or orthoimagery data, just to name a few, is using data from The National Map. The impact of geospatial services on the web, many of which use the foundational data in the National Map, are also documented in the following report: https://www.valueoftheweb.com/reports/the-economic-impact-of-geospatial-services/.

While there are approximately 22 million visits to The National Map systems per year to access and visualize a wide variety of geospatial information and data, it pales compared to the general public use of our data through other private sector applications. The National Map distributes approximately a petabyte of data per year primarily through bulk delivery, and provides approximately 1 million files for download of data a month of which over two thirds go to the private sector to be used to support a wide variety geospatial analyses and applications.","For over 125 years, the USGS has had a mandate to provide base topographic information to the Nation, to its own scientific programs, and those of other Federal agencies.

In pursuing this goal, Interior is following the information technology investment management practices and principles identified in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002.

Interior's goal is to continue improvements in business transaction processing, analysis, and reporting and to enhance business management systems support. Interior relies on business management systems planned for, managed together, and operated collectively to support program, business and financial managers.

Prior to FBMS the Department's business management systems architecture included redundant systems managed at the bureau level, some managed at the departmental level, and some that are government-wide systems on which the Department relies. FBMS established a single, integrated business management system architecture of four interrelated elements that drive business process improvements, and financial integrity. These are:
(1) improvement of internal controls;
(2) elimination of redundant data entry;
(3) enabling end-to-end transaction processing; and
(4) standardization of data for improved information quality and transparency.

In early FY 2014 Interior completed the migration of its bureaus onto FBMS. This important milestone positioned the Department to finally achieve the following goals across all of its bureaus:
- Standardized and integrated processes;
- Improved security and internal controls;
- Improved cost information;
- Improved tracking and auditing capabilities;
- Reduced data entry in multiple systems and manual paper processing;
- Improved Department-wide and bureau- specific reporting capabilities;
- Increased data integrity; and
- Retirement of aging and unsupported legacy systems.

Now that the solution is fully deployed across Interior, the Department is focused on improvements to the system to address customer service gaps and improve usability.

FBMS was successfully migrated to the cloud, the production landscape final Operational Readiness Review (ORR) quality gate passed 7/13/2015.

FBMS will be the reporting vehicle for all Data Act submissions.","010SO18248 - Reduce administrative and regulatory burden","The standardization and integration delivered by FBMS facilitates a common approach to financial and business management.  As a result, the Department is positioned to deliver programs and services in a more efficient and effective manner, with greatly improved internal controls.  Benefits gained from implementing FBMS include:

- Enhanced access to, and sharing of, real-time business information that supports effective business decisions for mission delivery at all levels in the organization in the Department, the bureaus and in the field. 
- More timely financial reports that facilitate analysis of financial, acquisition, financial assistance, and property data. For example, the Department used FBMS to automate reporting on Hurricane Sandy response and recovery. In the legacy environment, manual data calls and consolidation would have been necessary.
- Retirement of outdated and legacy systems that do not comply with current mandates and are no longer supported by their software vendors. FBMS enabled the decommissioning of 83 legacy systems, resulting in nearly 300 million dollars in cost avoidance.
- Increased data integrity and transparency, and increased process and data standardization among the bureaus.
- An improved internal control environment with separation of duties as well as refined and standardized business practices to support the internal controls, especially through the creation of automated controls.
- Support for the consolidated audit with centrally produced information that can be used by the Department, the OIG, and the independent auditor. This represents a significantly simpler financial audit that had been possible prior to FBMS.  Throughout the sequence of FBMS deployments, Interior has maintained its unqualified audit opinions.
- Shared expertise as the Department and the bureaus are able to consistently train personnel who can be leveraged across bureaus.    

The implementation of FBMS has enabled DOI to realize the benefits of a fully integrated, secure, modernized, system, and also strengthen communication and collaboration across the business management community. FBMS has proven effective as a means to integrate the siloed business management policy communities. This integration has enabled the Department to use FBMS as a platform to efficiently meet statutory and OMB-mandated requirements in the areas of financial, award, property and grant reporting, electronic invoicing, IT Security, improved internal controls, and others.","The FBMS system was implemented through multiple deployments, with functionality of the system expanding, and more DOI bureaus being added during each progressive deployment -- ending with Deployment 8.  This phased approach decreased risk and maximized return.
  
The FBMS project employed a formal Requirements Management Process as part of the  Ascendant SAP  Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Each successive FBMS deployment met a greater number of the total requirements tracked in the requirements registry.

NFPORS is funded by DOI and USDA, with DOI as the lead agency and therefore DOI provides the majority of full-time employee effort. NFPORS is used to manage the National Fire Plan, a mandated program that was begun in 2001 to provide accountability for hazardous fuels reduction, burned area rehabilitation projects, and community assistance activities. The NFPORS user community includes all federal wildland fire management bureaus in the DOI, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and Bureau of Reclamation (BOR); and, the USDA Forest Service.

In 2011, the department initiated a decision support process with the goal of improving transparency and uniformity of selecting and funding hazardous fuels reduction (HFR) projects.  NFPORS has a key responsibility in this initiative because NFPORS maintains much of the treatment and project details that are used to measure the value and expected benefits of planned HFR treatments.","010SO18245 - Manage wildland fire to reduce risk and improve ecosystem and community resilience","It has been estimated that NFPORS saves the Department over $5M each year in the costs associated with ""data calls"" alone.

The National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS) meets that mandate by providing annual reports in 3 of the 5 NFP Keypoints.  
National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy In response to requirements of the Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement (FLAME) Act of 2009, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC) directed the development of the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (Cohesive Strategy). The Cohesive Strategy is a collaborative process with active involvement of all levels of government and non-governmental organizations, as well as the public, to seek national, all-lands solutions to wildland fire management issues.  Changes to the National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS) will inevitably result from the completion of this ongoing strategic planning process.  Possibilities include incorporation of new national performance measures.  Naturally, the department will depend on NFPORS as the source of information and reports once these performance measures are finalized. (http://www.forestsandrangelands.gov/resources/overview/ ).

The GSS includes the integrated MAF/TIGER System - the Master Address File (MAF), an inventory of addresses, and the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER), an inventory of streets and other map feature information. The GSS also includes the annual Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The base GSS supports the collection of boundaries required to support estimates in demographic and economic areas (covering approximately 35% of functioning governments). The Decennial Census traditionally provides resources to collect the boundaries for the other 26,000 governments. 

Along with the ongoing efforts of the GSS to provide an up-to-date address list and increase the efficiency of field staff working on ongoing surveys, the GSS is critical to conducting a selective address canvassing operation (as opposed to a full, or 100 percent, address canvassing operation) in support of the 2020 Census. This will lead to cost avoidance during 2019 address canvassing operations.

The GSS supports the Department of Commerce's Science and Information goal.  Specifically, the Departmental objective to:  Improve understanding of the U.S. economy, society, and environment by providing timely, relevant, trusted and accurate data, standards, and services enabling entities to make informed decisions.  Specific contributions from the GSS to the Department of Commerce s mission delivery are the establishment and distribution of the geographic component for the multi-agency collaborative Geospatial Platform (GeoPlatform) and the government s Data.gov website. 

Further, the GSS supports the Census Bureau's Strategic Plan Goal 2.b. to provide timely, relevant, accurate, and accessible benchmark measures of the U.S. population, economy, and governments to assess U.S. competitiveness, identify new business opportunities, and foster domestic job growth.","006APG18077 - Prepare to Conduct a Complete and Accurate 2020 Decennial Census, 006SO18022 - Advance Innovation, 006SO18030 - Enhance the Nation's Cybersecurity, 006SO18033 - Conduct a Full, Fair, and Accurate Decennial Census, 006SO18034 - Provide Accurate Data to Support Economic Activity, 006SO18250 - Conduct a Complete and Accurate Decennial Census","Benefits of the GSS include: 
1. A geographic framework from which the U.S. Census Bureau can generate maps required to support boundary collection and validation activities, address list review activities, field data collection operations, and the data product dissemination program. 
2. A basis for geographic-based requirements for use in updating the MAF/TIGER System with city-style addresses for new housing units, some new streets, and revised boundary information for some governments.  
3. Direct information to the GeoPlatform, which benefits all spatial data customers including tribal federal, state, and local governments, other governments, and private citizens by providing a common, consistent source of spatial data.  

Benefits of the GSS Initiative include: 
1. The improvement of address coverage in the most difficult to update areas, such as those that do not have or use city-style addresses and includes improving address updates by utilizing tribal state, and local government updates; updating the address inventory in areas not covered by the U.S. Postal Services Delivery Sequence file (DSF); and collecting GPS locations for new addresses.
2. A continual update of streets and their attributes, and the expansion of quality measurement procedures to assess address quality, identify areas for update, and evaluate and improve updating procedures; in order to determine suitability for current surveys and other programs, and refine the address universe determination for various programs.
3. The Census Bureau will actively foster partnerships and encourage greater participation by recruiting new tribal state, and local government partners for voluntary, ad hoc contributions of geospatial files to identify new streets, their names, and their address ranges, and most importantly, voluntary contribution of their address lists.
4. Continued product quality control which includes improved quality measurements and assessments of the MAF/TIGER System (particularly, the Address List) to provide data critical to conducting a selective address canvass in FY19 in support of the Decennial Census. Additionally, the GSS Program increasingly supports geocoding improvements beyond the incorporation of the 2010 Census address data into the MAF/TIGER System.","Legislative Mandate: US Constitution, Article 1, Section 2. http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html

The Secretary of Interior established the Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA) in July 2001. OHTA's mission is to perform the historical accounting of IIM accounts and verify their accuracy. Since its inception in 2001, OHTA's scope has expanded to include Tribal accountings, related to the approximately 100 active lawsuits filed by Tribes against Interior. OHTA provides litigation support to Interior, participates in settlement negotiations with tribes, and performs a historical accounting where necessary to support Court actions or settlement. To assist historical accounting efforts, OHTA developed a common Accounting Reconciliation Tool (ART). ART provides a standard and repeatable process for accountants to query transactions from legacy systems, link transactions to relevant source documents, and reconcile transactions and note discrepancies. In addition, the ART includes functionality that assists OHTA in performing quality control and monitoring of reconciliation activities. Data from ART is used to prepare the Historical Statements of Account, which fulfills Interior's requirement to provide a historical accounting. The Secretary has placed a priority on funding the historical accounting to support Cobell and Tribal lawsuits. OHTA senior management allocates the Office funding and ensures the necessary ART funding is provided. If the ART is not funded and is shut down, then Interior cannot comply with the Court's mandate to provide a historical accounting. This could lead to further court action, such as contempt of court citations, or other consequences for Interior. The ART addresses the ""Serving Communities"" mission area in Interior's Strategic Plan and allows Interior to achieve the End Outcome Goal to ""Fulfill Indian Fiduciary Trust Responsibilities"". Specifically, the ART enables Interior to comply with the Court ordered historical accounting and the Trust Funds Management Reform Act of 1994 (to account for the daily and annual balances of all funds held in trust by the US for the benefit of an Indian Tribe or an Individual, which are deposited or invested pursuant to the Act of June 24, 1938).","010SO18241 - Fulfill fiduciary trust","The Accounting Reconciliation Tool (ART) helped save the government billions of dollars in potential liabilities during the Cobell v. Salazar class-action lawsuit.  The Data within the ART allowed accountants and statisticians to extract information and statically provide evidence that helped facilitate a settlement of $1.4 billion for the Cobell portion of the lawsuit.  Early in the lawsuit, the Cobell plaintiffs suggested accounting errors and mismanagement of trust fund assets could reach as high as $176 billion.  Additionally, the information in ART has been and continues to be used for Tribal settlements and lawsuits, where further savings of millions of dollars for the government has occurred and will undoubtedly follow with future litigations.  Also, the ART enables Interior to provide requested information to any Tribe or Individual Indian without having to pull boxes of records to search from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  Therefore, if the document exists on ART, it delivers a quicker response to the requestor, it provides document preservation because the records do not need to be handles, and the cost saving from pulling a box from the NARA facility and the time of the searchers saves tens of thousands of dollars each year.","The ART addresses the ""Serving Communities"" mission area in Interior's Strategic Plan and allows Interior to achieve the End Outcome Goal to ""Fulfill Indian Fiduciary Trust Responsibilities"".

The mission of the IBC FMLoB is to offer comprehensive and cost effective financial and business management solutions to Cabinet and non-Cabinet federal agencies.   We accomplish this mission by delivering a core financial system based on commercial financial management software.  The IBC provides a full spectrum of services related to federal financial management, including hosting, application management, functional and technical support, conversion, implementation, quality assurance, interface and report development, project management, helpdesk support, audit support, security and training.  The IBC FMLoB services and staff of federal financial management and information technology experts help our customer agencies meet federal financial management mandates, particularly FFMIA, FMFIA and A-123.  Customer agencies benefit from these services and by sharing in costs with other customers.   In addition to helping customers meet their financial management processing needs and federal requirements, the IBC offers its FMLoB customers an optional federalized contract management system that is fully integrated with the core financial management system. 

Key customers include 18 small to mid-sized non-Cabinet federal agencies and one Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS will depart from the IBC in FY 2019.  The IBC is currently engaged in discussion with a very large Cabinet level agency from within the Department of the Interior for the modernization of a complex revenue management system.

The IBC FMLoB's customer agencies benefit from using IBC as their shared service provider for financial management so that they can focus on doing their mission critical work.  The U.S. federal government as a whole benefits from the utilization of federal SSPs, which provide lower costs for federal financial management, high fidelity of federal financial expertise, and government-compliant security measures.

This investment is dependent upon the DOI/IBC IT infrastructure investment reported by the Department of the Interior.","010SO18248 - Reduce administrative and regulatory burden","The IBC FMLoB as a federal shared services provider (FSSP) reduces the overall cost of financial management for the federal government.  Use of a FSSP allows federal agencies, particularly smaller ones, to focus on their primary mission, reduce risk of system failures, and avoid the costs associated with creating and maintaining individual financial systems. The IBC FMLoB provides overarching benefits to its19 customer agencies through:
 	1. reduction in the cost individual federal agencies would pay to meet mandatory financial management and reporting requirements
 	2. avoidance in the costs associated with creating and maintaining an inhouse financial system
 	3. reduction in the risk of system failure, security incidents and audit findings
 	4. greater efficiency and cost savings
 	5. compliance with new government-wide requirements
 	6. standardized data and greater financial transparency

The IBC FMLoB meets all current 0MB and Department of Treasury requirements related to financial management.  We have established continuous monitoring of configuration management, patch management, vulnerability management and network management.  Annual audits have resulted in an unqualified opinion in the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagement (SSAE-18) for seven consecutive years.

Without the IBC FMLoB, all customer agencies would need to either switch to another FSSP and funding those implementation costs OR implement and support an inhouse federal financial management solution. OFF implementations cost between $1 and $3M, depending on size and complexity, and typically take place over a 9-18 month period.  In FY19, the IBC FMLoB will have a total of 17 customers ranging from small to mid-size federal agencies.  Assuming four are mid-sized, five a very small, and eight somewhere in between, the sum for IBC s agencies to move to another FSSP would be in the range of $33M.

Agencies choosing an in-house solution would encounter prohibitive costs.  Most small/medium agencies have no experience IT financial mgmt. experience and lack standard procedures $2-4M, even more than moving to another FSSP.  Each agency would need to pay for their own hardware, software, audit and technical/functional support costs.  The largest cost would be in staffing for IT, systems accountants, functional, security and program management. Because of strict separation of duty requirements, agencies cannot have the same people doing multiple functions such as submitting a requisition and approving a requisition, enlarging the staff size even further.  Each agency would be forced to fund all hardware upgrades and software upgrades, which could cost over $1-3M every few years.  Small agencies would have little leverage to receive the volume discount on software licenses that the IBC FMLoB offers. And finally, each in-house system would require the acquisition or lease of a hosting facility, adding data center, infrastructure, network and additional software license costs for the operating system, data base, monitoring and governance, risk and compliance software.

A low estimate would be 35% higher for an in-house system; 50% or higher is more realistic.

Should the IBC FMLoB cease to exist, and all customer agencies migrated to another FSSP, the minimum cost to the government would be $33M, almost 50% more than IBC s annual O&M costs.  If all agencies built their own system, the cost would be $51M, plus 35-50% higher O&M costs, or $27-30M annually.","Through a competitive process in 2004, OMB designated IBC as federal shared service provider in Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB).

This standardization provides cost avoidance to DOI through economies of scale; it reduces/eliminates duplicate processes and streamlines HR processes. To fulfill OPM commitments, IBC continues to expand its current services by delivering a standardized, integrated HR Information System that supports the strategic management of human capital. FPPS provides OPM's five core HR services (benefits administration, payroll, personnel action processing, time and attendance, and labor cost distribution to more than 46 federal agencies. IBC also offers a modern data warehouse for purposes of reports and data analysis. IBC has enhanced its FPPS services by expanding its non-core systems offerings that includes an integration framework enabling real-time interoperability between FPPS and other systems: Entrance On Duty (EODS); Talent Management (TMS); Workforce Transformation and Tracking (WTTS), and Electronic Official Personnel File (eOPF). WTTS and EODS are integrated real time with FPPS and with federal and commercial talent acquisition systems. IBC offers licensing discounts for these systems to its customers. (Some customers receive a discount of more than 50% of what they could obtain on their own.) HRLOB directly supports DOI's Strategic Human Capital Management Plan. Consolidation of DOI HR services provides cost avoidance and economies of scale..

As one of five federal Shared Service Centers, it has already helped achieve billions of dollars in savings to the federal government.  Per OPM's eGov website, HRLOB  realized $1.625 billion in cost savings and avoidance through FY15 and will continue to realize $184 million per year afterwards.   As the IBC's customer base continues to grow with new clients or current clients adding services, IBC saves millions of dollars for both DOI and IBC's non-Interior clients by providing cost avoidance and/or cost savings through economies of scale. For FY17, the W-2 rate is $198 per W-2 (no cost increase from FY16.  As the rate was $197 per W-2 in 1997, the costs are actually more than 35% lower today, adjusted for inflation. Instead of keeping up with the CPI, the rate is saving the clients over $29M annually. Since 2010, the functionality of the system has increased more than 50%.  In addition, IBC offers discount pricing on licensing for Talent Acquisition which has saved customers $28.98M since FY09.  In some cases, clients have saved 79% over what they would have paid on their own.  HRLOB implemented the HR System Integration Framework in 2009, providing real-time integration between multiple systems.  As of June 2015, there were 374,948 transactions resulting in avoidance of duplicate data entry for 10 million data elements.  Additionally, FPPS has employee event notification web services that notify subscribing systems of changes to any of 213 data elements for an employee's personal information.  To date there have been 3.3 million event notices, saving duplicate data entry for 378 million data elements.

It provides comprehensive statistics that meet the needs of government, business, economic and academic researchers, and the American public. The lessons learned from the 2012 Census of Governments revealed a number of deficiencies that reduced the overall quality of the survey. Deficiencies included a lack of modern software to maintain the survey frame, and modern, flexible processing system for efficient data processing. These factors led to a considerable amount of staff time to process the survey. Corrective measures include two initiatives: a new data repository; and a new comprehensive processing system, flexible and inclusive of the survey business processes.  The 2017 Economic Census has been re-engineered to accelerate data collection, analysis, and product delivery; cut costs; eliminate redundancy; and produce consistent processes. The goal was to create a single integrated program built around consistent business processes that are comparable across sectors, and occurring over several censuses. This strategy will integrated and leveraged enterprise solutions to publish comparable data sets for the entire economy utilizing the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS).    

The Governments Master Address File (GMAF) will enabled survey methodologist to keep the survey universe population or frame current, accurate, and complete. The Governments Processing Interactive Console (GPIC) is a software system that integrates all aspects of the survey life cycle into a modern architecture that enables staff to process a survey through a common set of tools. The two initiatives will improved the overall quality of the 2017 CoG, reduced respondent burden, staff time, and allowed CoG to execute within budget and schedule. FY 2018 performance goals for this Investment will be to increase efficiencies with the significant amount of central collection arrangements and compilations of audited financial records and to develop collection strategies and highly usable collection instruments, which obtain needed content, conform to accounting conventions and prevailing recordkeeping practices, use clear, industry-standard terminology and minimize response burden on governments.","In Section 401 of Executive Order 12656 directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide for the collection and reporting of census information on human and economic resources and to maintain a capability to conduct emergency surveys to provide information on the status of these resources as required for national security.

The Information Technology  Directorate is the Census Bureau's principal provider of IT solutions for mission-critical field data collection and related activities. This program activity investment, Field Support Systems (FSS), encompasses a portfolio of applications and systems that support data collection operations. These systems provide respondent data to sponsors of demographic, economic and decennial programs. Many of these programs produce national statistics and serve as leading economic indicators of the national economy (i.e. unemployment rate, housing starts, and poverty rate). Most surveys incorporate the use of electronic questionnaires on devices such as laptops to conduct doorstep interviews. Surveys can also use electronic questionnaires to conduct telephone interviews from centralized facilities. The FSS supports over 7,000 field interviewers reporting to 6 regional offices in FY17, 650 call center agents from three nationally based telephone centers, and numerous support staff at HQ. These systems operate 7 days a week, 24 hours a day and must be available for field staff at all times. The FSS has been implemented and is now in the operational (steady state) stage of its life cycle. The FSS provides implementation of data collection techniques that reduce data gathering and capture efforts.  FSS allows the Field Directorate to quickly gather, process and share information with our survey sponsors. The FSS supports the following DOC strategic objective: Objective 14: Improve understanding of the US economy, society and environment by providing timely, relevant, trusted and accurate data, standards and services enabling entities to make informed decisions.

This global logistics platform integrates the requisition, procurement, distribution, transportation, receipt, asset and fleet management, diplomatic pouch and mail and supports the Department’s mission by getting the right resources to the right place at the right time for 35,000 global users. The Department benefits from a single modern solution that replaces 28+ legacy systems with a state-of-the art COTS suite that integrates logistics and financial systems, strengthens internal controls, increases visibility, delivers significant process efficiencies and serves as the Department’s system of record for asset management, procurement, fleet, transportation and expendables supplies. ILMS provides a shared service for procurement, transportation, property, motor pool and diplomatic pouch and mail for 50 distinct national security and foreign affairs agencies. ILMS procures and accounts for $10B in goods and services worldwide and moves an average 1,100 pouches per day and 15M kg of mail annually.

ILMS transforms transactional data into metrics that enable data-driven decisions for logistics managers, and return real efficiencies, inventory reductions and cost savings. A new data forensics effort identifies areas for tighter management control and potential fraud indicators. In FY17, modernization increased system process performance by 40%, reduced time to compile key reports from weeks to minutes, upgraded ILMS to the latest procure to pay and security technologies, and reduced navigation for approvals from 5 clicks to 1 across 60 user groups. Innovation via mobile apps enables logistics on the go.
A performance indicator in the Bureau Strategic Plan, ILMS aligns with the Joint Strategic Plan and the QDDR by providing modern tools and transparency, positioning DOS as a federal leader for the 21st century. ILMS was selected for the 2015 CIO 100 award and the 2012 Excellence.gov award.","014SO18091 - Strengthen the effectiveness and sustainability of our diplomacy and development investments, 014SO18092 - Provide modern and secure infrastructure and operational capabilities to support effective diplomacy and development","The Benefit/ Cost Analysis (BCA) shows the ILMS investment yields a positive return with 4.07 times the benefits to cost ratio based on risk adjusted benefits—delivered either as cost savings, cost avoidances and productivity enhancements across a ten-year horizon. Costs include Government FTEs, contract services, software, and equipment. This investment is positioned to deliver cumulative benefits of $1B over the next 5 years. Cost savings represent anywhere from $25M to $40M annually based on replaced legacy systems, accurate recovery of revenue from shared-service agencies, strategic sourcing savings (using ILMS Analytics), reductions in assessments for the Department of State furniture and appliance pool and reduction in prompt payment penalties through real-time transportation alerts. ILMS realizes approximately $15M in cost avoidances annually because Posts avoid maintenance of logistics systems on local servers and investment in cuff or purchased applications. Post also defer procurement of expendables and furniture and appliance inventory based on recommended reorder points for replenishing inventory. ILMS generates significant productivity benefits, more than $150M+ a year, for the global logistics workforce by: automating logistics processes, reducing data entry, integrating data to track status of items in a timely and accurate manner, and increasing billing accuracy for shared services throughout the procure-to-pay process. Before ILMS integration, staff duplicated data entry and reconciliation across seven previously separate logistics systems. Recent deployment of RFMS integration delivers productivity benefits to overseas financial management personnel through real-time funds availability checks, automated obligations and automated commitment accounting. Implementation of a system to automate the processing of overseas federal financial assistance replaces a manual paper-driven process. Fleet management resulted in increased automation, efficient reporting, bulk uploading of fuel tickets and flexibility in customer billing. ILMS Analytics delivers $16M in annual productivity benefits by delivering actionable business intelligence via 28 dashboards saving time to locate and transform data from independent reports.","ILMS is the result of a the Logistics Re-engineering Study commissioned by the Under Secretary for Management which identified an agency performance gap related to the use of 20+ redundant non-integrated systems. ILMS was approved by eGOV in 2001 and mandated for overseas use in 2007 via DOS cable.  
ILMS property management requirements address an internal control weakness identified by the OIG in the area of property management and track $4.4B in Department assets world-wide. ILMS grants administration functionality addresses the remaining portion of a 2009 significant internal control deficiency in the area of federal financial assistance. Conversion of Diplomatic Security (DS) security equipment ensures DS asset records are accounted for in ILMS, fully FFMIA compliant, DS inventory is reconciled and reported in ILMS on an annual basis, and accurately reflected in the Department's financial statements.

It is critical to day-to-day operations, supporting DOS’ mission by effectively accounting for business activities and recording financial information, including obligations and costs, performance, financial assets, and other data. GFMS - A series of major, incremental projects to address financial system improvements and establish a single global financial management system integrating DOS overseas and domestic financial operations. GFMS provides a single integrated view of financial data through data standardization, common business processes, and the exchange of information through DOS financial sectors. It has improved operations and reduced costs by eliminating system redundancies and replacing obsolete financial systems. It provides the infrastructure for integrating with other activities within DOS. The GFMS project is in the Operations & Maintenance phase, operating 24X7 in a highly complex international multi-currency environment. It supports all of DOS and 45+ other USG entities operating overseas. There are over 4000 users world-wide, including financial staff processing accounting and disbursing transactions, accountants, financial analysts, contract officers and acquisitions personnel and senior executives responsible for managing financial, acquisition, and program operations and financial reporting. Common Platform - A series of incremental projects to improve operations and save money through DOS/USAID collaboration to operate financial systems on a common platform, including shared telecommunications/server infrastructures; COTS based software for financial management (separate databases); consolidated software licensing, software maintenance fees, integration support services, and hardware costs; consolidate financial system computer operations and COOP facilities.","014SO18091 - Strengthen the effectiveness and sustainability of our diplomacy and development investments, 014SO18092 - Provide modern and secure infrastructure and operational capabilities to support effective diplomacy and development","With the integration of acquisitions into the core financial systems, coupled with the adoption of line level payments, JFMS provides a higher standard of accountability, internal control and payment integrity, which is critical to detecting and preventing improper payments should contractors submit improper billings or have faulty billing systems. For example, in FY2008 the additional line level detail has allowed the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) to identify and correct over $13 million in inaccurate billings and recover another $24 million through post payment audits of prior year invoices.

By establishing the Post Support Unit (PSU), the burden of repetitive, standardized financial processing is being removed from posts and offices and performed centrally at a substantially lower cost with improved accounting (in 2010, the avg cost per accounting entry for an ICASS standard Post was $32.48; the PSU was able to perform the same service at $11 per entry). These centralization and service initiatives allow at-post, front-line financial management personnel to focus on higher value-added and location-specific financial management activities. Post Support Units are now operational in Charleston SC, Bangkok Thailand, and Sofia Bulgaria, servicing more than 138 posts worldwide.

Current JFMS COTS Update initiatives will provide further gains through improved payments processes; improved system data entry processes, performance and response time, reduced interactive processing time and associated costs; increased user satisfaction and efficiencies through an improved user interface; and business process improvements enabled by new COTS functionality.","The solution must be able to meet mandates such as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), which  requires that agency financial management systems provide reliable financial data that complies with Federal system requirements, Federal accounting standards, and the US Government Standard General Ledger (SGL); the Prompt Payment Act, which requires that interest penalties be paid if payment is not made by the required due date; the Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), which requires agencies to reduce and recover improper payments; and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), which defines a framework for managing information security to which all information systems used or operated by a U.S. federal government agency must conform.",yes,no,no,N/A.,,"Parrish, Dawn","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",35.568000,34.703000,36.277000,29.307200,2003,2023,"Funding levels have not changed.

This is achieved through automating business processes, eliminating paperwork, reducing administrative burden, and improving data. 
By streamlining grant processes, HUD has: reduced time to competitive award for homeless assistance from 140 days to 90 days in FY18; saved communities an estimated 65000 staff hours (and HUD 30000) annually in consolidated planning activities; reduced from 90 days to 45 days average time to complete grantee risk analysis; & maintained the information systems that serve as the primary business interface for over 10000 users. This improves program results & outcomes for citizens by supporting grantee capacity to execute HUDs mission. As national economic recovery continues, HUDs community development, disaster recovery, and homeless assistance programs are more important than ever. HUD's grantees are direct agents for disaster recovery, affordable housing, generating jobs and providing services to low-income families, the homeless, veterans, HIV/AIDS patients, the unemployed, and those under foreclosure.

The eMED system is not interoperable and not used globally. It does not comply with Executive Order 13410 and Meaningful Use (MU) criteria of HITECH Act 2009. The need for an EHR is in response to Executive Order 13410 mandating that all federal agencies must have an EHR that is interoperable with other agency systems.  In addition to fulfilling this presidential mandate, MU criteria, and HITECH requirements, MED seeks to improve the quality and efficiency of care it delivers across its global enterprise. MED is currently in the planning stages of implementing a shared COTS EHR with USCG.   The EHR provides a single, electronic, authoritative source of medical information that can be accessed by multiple providers for patient care delivery, medical evacuations and hospitalizations, medical clearance decisions, medical record actions, and medical program management.  This investment will provide a standard, rapid and secure way to enter new medical information into a patient’s MED EHR. Specific benefits to the Department include increased operational efficiency; improved patient documentation; enhanced remote access; improved capacity to provide rapid response to medical crises and mass casualty events; and the ability to retrieve epidemiological and quality assurance data, thus enabling MED to better manage the medical program.

In addition to the costs directly associated with the EHR, such as purchasing and licensing fees, there are also costs that may not be as easy to recognize and calculate.  
Much of our ROI arises mainly from efficiency gains; improvements in practice proficiency, collaboration, information, and integration through “Digital Diplomacy""; improved workflow efficiency in all key MED business units; and availability of medical data to all domestic and overseas medical personnel.  
This investment provides MED with a worldwide state-of-the-art integrated health information system (IHIS) that enhances the quality and efficiency of the medical care MED delivers. The IHIS includes an electronic health record (EHR) that has many capabilities such as clinical decision support, integrated electronic prescribing, quality data reporting, a patient portal and biosurveillance reporting that our current health information systems do not have. 
Specific benefits to the Department include increased operational efficiency; improved security and integrity of medical data; enhanced remote access to this data; improved capacity to provide rapid response to medical crises and mass casualty events; and the ability to retrieve epidemiological and quality assurance data, thus enabling MED to better manage the medical program. Most importantly, it will also improve our patients access to medical care and their satisfaction with the care they receive. In addition, the new EHR system will provide MED with a global EHR solution to standardize and improve processes in all Health Units worldwide.

It provides structured data retrieval and reporting across USACE business lines, thereby providing USACE leadership with a more comprehensive executive level reporting capability, allowing for more informed decision making. 

Benefits of the Enterprise Data Warehouse include the ability to share information across business lines, common reporting tools which encourage standardization of both business processes as well as tools, elimination of the need for additional databases to support emergent customer requirements to establish new views of existing data based upon business lines.  

It provides one source for coded and on demand analytical reporting removing the need for same in each source system.  By providing a single source for reports that have been vetted for accuracy and compliance with reporting requirements, the investment allows access to needed data without requiring data users to directly access the source systems and allows prior analysis and development work to be reused to support new requirements.  

EDW investment is dependent on the successful implementation of other USACE investments which represent the source data, such as Rental Facilities Management Information System (RFMIS), Real Estate Management Information System (REMIS), Civil Works (CWBI), Financial (CEFMS), and Project Management (P2)  as well as other corporate investments and corporate IT infrastructure initiatives.","0 - Not Applicable","The EDW provides USACE with a high performing common environment for aggregating and reporting on mission critical data.  Since the EDW's inception the USACE community has been offered the EDW as a centrally managed and maintained asset accessible to both HQ and field activities and is an opportunity to lower their operating costs while improving their capability set.  The Corps has steadily reduced the number of legacy data storage and reporting tools that must be maintained. The majority of highly shared data within the enterprise has been captured and a wide range of business intelligence products have been developed for more than a dozen communities within the Corps.  These products have allowed the Corps to save millions of dollars and thousands of man hours through process implement, cost avoidance and enhanced management practices enabled through enterprise reporting.

The EDW facilitates reporting and data analysis across USACE using the enterprise reporting suite SAP Business Objects (BOBJ), which delivers analytical reports to users.  Specifically the P2/PMBP community provides process standardization and support to the Corps  corporate, regional, and district level program and project management workforce.  A suite of universes have been developed in the EDW to help the PMBP user community more efficiently meet their reporting requirements.  These PMBP universes are the only universes in the EDW that tie together data from P2, CEFMS, RMS, and RBC.   The PMBP universes were designed in such a way that they segment data based on business needs, which greatly reduces the data retrieval times, allowing for quicker refresh times for reports.  The average refresh time for data retrieval from these universes is well under the pre-defined 45 second goal. Multiple universe average refresh times are under 10 seconds.

Examples of internal and external benefits are:

1) The full implementation of a nationwide, real-time lock operations module providing lock operations data for the private sector navigation shippers and carriers to schedule shipping more efficiently by using traffic information from the Internet. This module also provides the Corps lock operators real-time knowledge of river traffic for scheduling and queuing, thus allowing them to better plan their time.

2) CWBI integrates with the National Recreation and Reservation System (NRRS) that is managed by the Forest Service and operated by the private sector. This integration meant that the Corps was able to eliminate the Corps internal reservation system and realize a cost savings.

3) The CWBI module of Lock Performance Monitoring System is a national system for managing both vessel traffic and water levels at the 200+ locks and dams within the USACE Navigation system nationwide.  The hydrology module is being used to monitor the varying water levels on the Mississippi River. Real time lockage data is collected and provided to the USCG, the USDA and the public.

4) The USACE Regulatory data shares permit data on a real time basis with both EPA and the USFWS to increase awareness of Clean Water Act permit applications and the linkages with proposed wetland mitigation projects.","Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, as amended; USACE Navigation Mission

CLASS supports efforts to understand climate variability and change by enhancing society's ability to plan and respond to climate events through the application of modern, proven techniques and technology.  By engineering a transition to an enterprise-capable data storage solution, CLASS will afford efficient management of high volumes of critical data.

Management of these data requires a rapid expansion in storage capacity at the Data Centers and automation of data ingest, archive, quality control, and access.  Significant increases in data volumes over the next 15 years and corresponding growth in the number and sophistication of system users necessitate this shift from the traditional standalone archive paradigm to a fully operationally-integrated system managed at the enterprise level.  For example, data from the S-NPP satellite program will utilize CLASS in lieu of building its own dedicated data archive system.  

Large portions of the Nation's current archive of environmental data are stored and maintained by the NOAA National Data Centers.  These data exist in several disparate systems, with unique archive and access capabilities.  CLASS will provide a standard, integrated solution to data archive and access, resulting in numerous benefits:  an easy-to-use access Portal for the Nation to obtain environmental data; integration of data with NOAA user services; higher quality and volume of environmental data which contributes to improvements in prediction capabilities; and decreased resource redundancy and cost.  The CLASS program has identified technologies and best practices to efficiently archive the NOAA satellite and observational data; to safely and permanently preserve those valuable data for future generations to use; and to provide rapid data access in a cost-effective manner.

Federal agencies that have management and administrative responsibility for large areas of federal land also have the legal authority to protect those lands from the adverse effects of wildfire. Wildland fires are hazardous events that threaten the safety of the general public as well as agency personnel.  Wildland fires often move across or take place in multiple emergency response jurisdictions (e.g., BLM, National Park Service, Forest Service, States, Counties, Municipalities), creating a formidable challenge to coordinating the management of a wildland fire.  As well, characterizing the entire fire event lifecycle in a historical context.   

IRWIN will reduce multiple instances of redundant data entry across wildland fire information systems.  Moreover, IRWIN will promote consistency in providing updated fire data across information systems that produce or contain data related to wildland fire. IRWIN will also promote a consistent and repeatable process to gather information that describe wildland fires.   This information will provide agency personnel with a consolidated view of  wildland fire data, including the important context of source of the data, the timeliness of the data, how the data sources relate, and the statistical relevance of the information.

Based on recent feedback and current functionality of IRWIN is saving substantial time in labor by reducing the amount of time it takes a dispatcher to input data into a single system and make that data available to the integrated systems. 

Supplemental economic metrics such as payback period (PBP) and benefit to cost ratio (BCR) are estimated as part of the ongoing independent review (estimated completion Sept 2018) of IRWIN.

Draft results from the ongoing independent review of IRWIN indicate, to-date (FY 2011 to the end of FY 2017) labor savings are estimated at just over $100 million with more than four times that amount ($421 million) estimated to be saved over the life cycle of the IRWIN project. The overall ROI (FY 2011 to FY 2025) is estimated at 1133% and the to-date ROI is estimated at 752%. The corresponding BCR for these results are 12 and 8.5, respectively. A BCR above 1.0 is considered beneficial, so these results are well within the range of economic feasibility.  

The PBP is the amount of time it takes for un-discounted benefits to equal un-discounted investment costs. A PBP in the range of 2 or 3 years is generally considered a positive result. The PBP is estimated to be 3.1 years. This puts the breakeven point in FY 2014. 

These results make to-date costs associated with IRWIN an attractive financial investment. This estimate indicates that the IRWIN project is presently on-track to deliver a positive economic benefit to the DOI and its user community. Historical expenditures from FY 2011 to FY 2017, as well as the projected spending of $2.55 million per year from FY 2018 to FY 2025 are more than compensated for by estimated labor savings over the same period. A comparison of discounted investment costs (expenditures) with discounted benefits (labor savings) yields a positive ROI over the remaining years in the life cycle of IRWIN.","Based on several studies conducted over a period of 10 years, it has been determined that data entry requirements for the management and reporting of incidents has grown exponentially.

FSA FMS Operations and Management oversight is managed through 74 Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that are metric-based and measured on a monthly basis.  These SLAs are the primary means of determining the performance level of the contractor. The SLAs are also the basis for incentive awards and disincentive penalties as each SLA has an associated monthly invoice percentage amount that is added or subtracted monthly depending on a pass / fail score of the SLA. Each SLA is individually assigned to a FMS team member or the COR for monthly review. The contractor self-reports pass / fail of each SLA, including details, as part of the monthly report deliverable. The assigned government staff reviews this reporting, compares it to their own data and knowledge, and either approves or disapproves the SLA as reported by the contractor. Where variances occur, the COR accumulates all comments and documentation, and submit them to the CO along with a recommendation for Acceptance or Rejection of the SLA.

This investment is in response to a Congressional mandate in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Students Succeeds Act (ESSA) that requires the Secretary to assist States in facilitating the transfer of migrant student records on a national basis through the use of MSIX.  The MSIX investment consists of a web-based system, MSIX, that allows all State migrant programs to upload common academic and health-related information to one database and extract that information when the student arrives in their state. The investment also consists of an independent verification and validation effort to ensure the proper design, development and operation of the MSIX. The primary beneficiaries of the MSIX are the migrant students whose records are transferred in a timely and accurate manner thus enabling the student to be quickly enrolled in the correct grade or course or have their secondary course credits accrued towards graduation. The MSIX also leverages school demographic data collected from States by the National Center of Educational Statistics (NCES) to populate the MSIX. These school data are uploaded and refreshed on a monthly basis.","018SO18040 - Prepare all students for successful transitions to college and careers by supporting access to dual enrollment, job skills development and high-quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).","MSIX is a unique system developed in response to the Congressional mandate to facilitate the exchange of migrant student records between and amongst States.  MSIX was developed as the most cost effective method to address this exchange.  If MSIX was not in existence, each State would be left to enhance it's own migrant, specific database to allow for the national exchange of migrant student records. However, there would be no national standard for migrant data exchange such as provided by MSIX.  The cost to implement such measures would be approximately $1M for each of the 46 States that implement migrant programs.  This calculation is based on the average costs of enhancements to MSIX for the past 5 years.","The purpose of the MSIX investment is supporting the exchange of migrant student records from one school district to another as migrant students move within State or across State lines. This investment is in response to a Congressional mandate in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Students Succeeds Act (ESSA) that requires the Secretary to assist States in facilitating the transfer of migrant student records on a national basis through the use of MSIX. The MSIX investment consists of a web-based platform that links States migrant student record databases to facilitate the national exchange of migrant students educational and health information. The investment also involves an independent verification and validation (IV&V) effort to ensure correctness and quality of the design, development, and operation of MSIX and related deliverables. 

The investment has four goals. These goals include exchanging education and health data; promoting the use of MSIX; ensuring the utilization of the consolidated records for enrollment, placement, and credit accrual, as well as producing national data on the migrant population. The primary beneficiaries of MSIX investments are the migrant students and State Migrant Education Program (MEP) grantees. Migrant students benefit from educational records transferred in a timely and accurate manner; available educational records enable students to be quickly enrolled in the correct grade or course or have their secondary course credits accrued towards graduation. MSIX also benefits MEPs by providing data and reporting capabilities on the migrant student population supporting strategic planning and delivery of migrant education services.

On September 19, 2016, VA selected USDA as its FSSP to guide VA's migration to an integrated financial and acquisition management solution. In December 2017, USDA officially notified VA that they would no longer serve as FSSP to VA in support of FMBT; VA has been solely managing the Financial Management Business Transformation (FMBT) program since January 2018 and all transition activities were complete by March 2018. VA will migrate to CGI's Momentum commercial cloud solution, configured for VA as Integrated Financial and Acquisition Management System (iFAMS), allowing VA to leverage the Software as a Service (SaaS) model.

VA will gain increased operational efficiency, productivity, agility, and flexibility from a modern Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) cloud solution. The new cloud solution will also provide additional security, storage, and scalability. By implementing the Momentum solution, VA is getting real-time integration of acquisitions and financials through a single, consolidated system and gaining the following inherent functionality: Real-time funds validation when processing commitments and obligations; Tracking of undelivered orders (unliquidated obligations); Tracking of expenditures on obligations (invoices, payments, and collections); Consolidated system to view all acquisitions and financial transactions through the Central Contract File and Online queries; Copy forward functionality for all Acquisition lifecycle transactions and a Consolidated financial and contract closeout process.","029SO18127 - VA's infrastructure improvements, improved decision-making protocols, and streamlined services enable VA to agilely adapt to changing business environments and veteran needs, 029SO18129 - VA IT modernization will quickly deliver effective solutions that will enable VA to provide improved customer service and provide a secure and seamless experience while decreasing its rate of spend.","Financial Management will result in both internal and external benefits.

RAMS is a multipurpose tool for ORD and VA Medical Center field research offices and provides the capability to create and track administrative data for each project assigned to the local research office; manage research oversight committees and subcommittees; track research personnel assignments, training requirements, and certifications; manage laboratory data including space allocations and equipment; and support required reporting to ORD. This project adds the capability to manage studies overseen by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) as well as the ability to share data with the Research and Development (R&D) and Safety Committees. RAMS allows a VA ORD Research Station to provide oversight to the totality of research activities at that station. It will also add an integrated capability for reporting.

GenISIS is an informatics platform developed to support the Million Veteran Program (MVP). MVP will build a mega cohort of a million consented Veterans to obtain bio-samples and to integrate their clinical, self-reported and genomic data to advance research towards improving and personalizing health care delivery in the VA. GenISIS currently supports functionalities like an electronic recruiting engine that has, to date, been used to recruit over 330,000 Veterans into MVP.","029SO18121 - VA anticipates veterans' changing needs throughout their lives to enhance their choices, 029SO18122 - veterans are informed of, understand, and can avail themselves of the benefits, care, and services they choose","The Return on Investment (ROI) of the Health Research Investment can be measured by qualitative health benefits received by the Veteran population and their dependents due to advances in health care as a result of research and by streamlining and standardizing the administrative processes at the Office of Research and Development.   

The investment aids in the collection of genomic samples from Veterans who participate in the Million Veteran Program (MVP).  GenISIS will, by supporting research and clinical care, establish an IT infrastructure and database for providing results of genomic discoveries and analysis back to health care providers, along with clinical decision support, reducing testing and introducing precision therapy. Data and supporting educational information will also be provided to participants.

Manual tracking of research projects and participants throughout the department will be replaced with a centralized IT system.  This will result in standardized reporting and information gathering.  The resulting system will allow for centralized management of research initiatives and participants.  It will also reduce errors, enable more efficient tracking of research participants, and centralize research project management.  The response time for internal and external request for program information will be reduced by 90 percent due to the online automated Research Administration Management System (RAMS).","Executive Order 13563 - Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/18/executive-order-13563-improving-regulation-and-regulatory-review).

RD offers a variety of direct and guaranteed loan programs for Single Family (SF) and Multi-Family (MF) Housing, Business, Community Facilities, and Utilities programs. The IT portfolio that supports the various loan programs consisted of more than 75 systems built on a variety of hosting platforms, system technologies, and database software some of which are program specific and duplicate functionality. CLP delivers a more agile, more flexible, and more fully integrated IT platform. It continually: Improves the delivery and access of RD services to citizens; Provides RD staff in the field offices and other locations with greatly improved automation support; Enables more rapid rollout of new or changed programs; Provides improved data accessibility and reporting to support executive decision making; Reduces operations and maintenance complexity through the elimination of duplicate IT systems; and Modernizes the technologies to help improve availability of support, systems security, and longevity of systems. In FY09 and FY10, the CLP investment only included DME activities associated with planning the modernization of the current application portfolio. In FY12, the CLP investment subsumed the RD operational investments: Guaranteed, Commercial, Program Funds Control System, Business Intelligence, Automated Mail Processing, RD eGov, RD Performance Management, and Program Loan Accounting System, making it a mixed-life cycle investment. The CLP investment will also integrate the general ledger, cash tracking and funds control functionality from existing RD legacy systems to the USDA FMMI initiative when the USDA is ready to initiate the effort.","005SO18288 - Expand rural business opportunity and rural quality of life with access to capital; improvd infrastructure, broadband access, and connectivity; and support for workforce availability.","The Comprehensive Loan Program (CLP) return on investment cannot be calculated at this time due to contract delays, task order stoppage and the lack of a quality assurance program on deliverables.  These issues have recently impacted the investment’s risk rating resulting in a lower rating from Green to Yellow over the last three quarters.  As a result, the USDA OCIO has initiated an internal USDA TechStat review.  This review will ensure senior management oversight and awareness of planned IT management corrective actions to ensure the investment achieves its intended goals and objectives.   In addition, under new CIO leadership, the CLP investment has shifted from a custom code delivery model to an off-the-shelf or configurable agile development strategy with the intent to deliver software applications faster and more efficiently to meet customer requirements.  Based on the outcome of the internal TechStat review, the CLP investment will be rebaselined and the life cycle costs and benefits as well as the associated ROI will be updated accordingly.  Rural Development is also considering re-structuring its IT Investment Portfolio including decoupling the CLP IT investment into smaller more manageable and transparent components.

The consistency of Landsat data acquired through the years allows for direct comparison of current specific site images with those taken months, years, or decades earlier. This comparison process can reveal land-cover changes that occur slowly and subtly, or quickly and devastatingly. The richness of the archive, combined with a no cost data policy, allows users to exploit time series of data over extensive geographic areas to establish long-term trends and monitor the rates and characteristics of land surface change.  

The Land Satellites Data System (LSDS) exemplifies the Federal CIO's guidance to innovate, deliver and protect by providing a unique, global, long-term archive of the Earth's land surface with enhanced delivery through various channels while continuing to protect and preserve the Landsat Global Archive.  Primary LSDS IT functions include:
- Capture land surface data.
- Archive satellite mission data.
- Calibrate and validate satellite data.
- Process data to generate user products.
- Delivery of data through the user portal with search capability.

LSDS ensures that timely, consistently calibrated imagery of the Earth's land surface is available to users worldwide.  LSDS customers/users include Federal, State, local and tribal governments, academia, industry, international community, and the general public requiring land surface data for applications such as resource management, water management, emergency response, agricultural, forestry, geology, and land change science.","010SO18229 - Utilize science in land, water, species and habitat management supporting decisions and activities","In 2012, a study was performed by the USGS to explore who uses Landsat imagery, how they use the imagery, and what the value of the imagery is to them. The results of the survey revealed that users around the globe from multiple sectors use Landsat imagery in many different ways, as demonstrated by the breadth of project locations and scales, as well as application areas. Changes in acquisition patterns, including the increase in the number of scenes acquired and the decreasing amount of money spent after the imagery became available at no cost, point toward increases in future use. The value of Landsat imagery to these users was demonstrated by the high importance placed on the imagery, the numerous benefits observed from projects using Landsat imagery, the impacts if Landsat imagery was no longer available, and the substantial aggregated annual economic benefit from the imagery.  (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20131269).

The Landsat Advisory Group of the National Geospatial Advisory Committee has also provided advice to the Department of Interior concerning the economic benefits of Landsat data. Their research provided estimates of the economic value of ten (10) uses of Landsat data and summarized recent estimates of the economic value of Landsat data from two large-scale surveys. Both approaches clearly showed that the annual economic value of Landsat data far exceeded the cost of building, launching, and managing Landsat satellites and sensors.

In the 2013 report,  Landsat and Beyond: Sustaining and Enhancing the Nation's Land Imaging Program , the National Research Council's (NRC's) Committee on Implementation of a Sustained Land Imaging Program noted that the economic, intrinsic, and scientific benefits to the United States of Landsat imagery far exceed the investment in the system.   

In July 2014, the National Science and Technology Council released the  National Plan for Civil Earth Observations .  This plan prioritizes 145 high-impact observation systems from 362 systems assessed across the US and places Landsat as the overall #3 system with respect to 12 societal benefit areas.

The 2017 USGS report ""Landsat and Agriculture - Case Studies on the Uses and Benefits of Landsat Imagery in Agricultural Monitoring and Production"" outlined the benefits of the information that
Landsat data provide ranging from conserving water and protecting public health and safety to informing decision makers.","15 U.S.C. 5652 The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 enables the United States to maintain its leadership in land remote sensing by providing data continuity for the Landsat program.

LSDS fulfills requirements of the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, through the continued collection, archive, and distribution of consistently calibrated imagery of the Earth's land surface.

The 1994 Presidential Decision Directive/NSTC-3 requires the Department of the Interior to maintain a national archive of existing and future Landsat-type remote sensing data within the United States and make such data available to U.

of information about the Federal financial aid history of recipients of student financial assistance,
authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Information from
NSLDS is used by stakeholders including the White House, Congress, GAO, OIG, lenders,
servicers, other federal agencies and most importantly, students and their parents, to provide a
comprehensive resource on disbursed Title IV aid.

As the central database for Title IV student financial aid, NSLDS stores information about loans,
grants, students, borrowers, lenders, guaranty agencies (GAs), schools, and servicers. It
provides an integrated view of Title IV loans and grants during all stages of their life cycle from
aid approval through disbursement, repayment, default, and closure. The three main goals of
the NSLDS are to:
1. Improve the quality and accessibility of student financial aid data.
2. Reduce the administrative burden of Title IV aid; and
3. Minimize abuse within aid programs by accurately tracking funds awarded to assist
postsecondary students.
NSLDS data is used to support the Department's commitment to protecting students' and
taxpayers' investments by using student aid and enrollment data to promote transparency in
college value and student outcomes for cohort default rates (CDR), the College Scorecard, and
Gainful Employment (GE) calculations. Since 2001 NSLDS has pre- and post-screened some
286 million student aid applicants, preventing over 4.9 million ineligible students from receiving
aid. NSLDS data is used in real time to support financial awareness counseling for students and
to help borrowers easily consolidate their loans and request an income driven repayment plan.
NSLDS has the added responsibility of protecting federal subsidized interest benefits, by
tracking the remaining eligibility periods for students receiving subsidized loans under the 150%
subsidized usage limit regulations and determining if the borrower has lost their interest

The program’s mission crosswalks to the Fiscal Service goal to “deliver innovative financial management solutions that provide a modern, seamless customer experience,” which in turn crosswalks to the Department’s goals of Transforming Government-Wide Financial Stewardship and Achieve Operational Excellence. 

To achieve our mission, Retail maintains public-facing applications to sell and service U.S. Treasury Securities directly to U.S. citizens to promote savings.  In FY17, Retail sold almost $42 billion worth of securities, and in FY18 we are on track to sell over $60 billion.  The Retail program is also responsible for servicing older Treasury debt instruments that matured, but remain unredeemed. This legacy debt dates back to the founding of our federal republic in 1789. This servicing is not provided as a courtesy, but directly serves a core goal of the Treasury to maintain the ""full faith and credit of the U.S. Federal government,"" by honoring all debt obligations of the Federal government regardless of its age.  In addition to servicing Treasury securities, Retail is also responsible for managing the disbursement of payments to Judgement Fund claimants, and maintain the audit trail to document these transactions.

In order to achieve its mission, the Retail program maintains multiple IT applications to sell and service its products. These systems are maintained under the consolidated investment portfolio known as the Retail Securities Servicing (RSS). These applications include relatively new internet-based systems and older mainframe-based systems that are hosted on various IT platforms maintained by both Fiscal Service and Federal Reserve personnel. 

For the last twenty years, the Retail program has aggressively pursued its goals by utilizing IT innovations; telecommunication improvements; and the internet to upgrade its product line, services and operations. The internet has provided us an opportunity to provide our customers more interactive services that empower self-servicing. These innovations and on-going project plans enable the Retail program to continue to remain relevant into the 21st century, while still being able to efficiently service legacy debt obligations.","015SO18116 - Debt Management: Fund the federal government at the least cost over time., 015SO18117 - Federal Financial Performance: Improve federal financial management performance using innovative practices to support effective government., 015SO18120 - Customer Value: Improve customer value by increasing the quality and lowering the cost of Treasury's products and services.","The primary tangible benefit provided by the RSS investment is the increase in federal revenue resulting from the sale of U.S. Treasury debt securities.  For the BY20 PoP, we estimate that Retail will sell a net average of $49 billion worth of securities per year.  The average annual cost for the investment is $42 million.  This results in an average ROI of almost 115900%.  For FY18, Retail sold almost $64 billion in net par.  The total annual cost to operate the entire Retail program is $130 million.  Based on these statistics, the Retail program costs only $0.20 for every $100 worth of par sold.  Factoring in all deductions and losses, the net cost to sell $100 of debt to Retail customers is $1.15 – which leaves a surplus of $98.85 that is returned to the Treasury General Appropriations account to fund other federal activities.  The Retail program, overall, is paying for its operations and returning an excess of almost 500% to the Treasury.

As for intangible benefits, the Retail program has had success in encouraging more citizens to save.  In the area of marketable security, the total number of accounts with holdings increased over 40% since FY16.  Individuals with moderately low dollar holdings ($5k or less) increased by 38%, while large dollar holdings ($50k or more) increased by 38%.  The Retail program is attracting an increasing amount of savers from various income groups.

The RSS investment consists of multiple custom-coded applications of an older vintage.  Retail is consequently partnering with its IT Service Provider to identify viable alternatives.  The goal is to mutually develop a modernization strategy that will replace these older systems with more technologically current applications that will increasingly leverage more cost effective enterprise-wide solutions.  These options include cloud computing.

Some success has already been achieved.  In FY18, the project began to replace a legacy payment system with a newer and more reliable application that is estimated to cost $660k less per year to operate and maintain.  A COTS alternative for processing foreign tax reporting has also been identified that will replace two older custom-coded applications.  The COTS alternative is estimated to cost $5k per year, while the current custom coded applications costs over $397k in O&M expenses. Retail’s long-term project of developing a replacement for its primary public-facing application is being reassessed.  Alternative development and host.","Legislative Mandates:

The CARMA project was chartered on 8/2/05 and entered the first initial production state on 6/07; full implementation occurred on August 2009. It became a stand-alone Reclamation major IT investment in 2010 after the TechStat on DOI's FMS. This investment consolidated (2007-2009) 18 independent implementations of Maximo version 4.1.1 into a single installation of IBM Maximo assets management version 6.x located in the Denver corporate office, w/ integration w/ Reclamation's ETAS time and attendance system. It is configured to meet the strategic goals and objectives of DOI and Reclamation's Asset Management Plan, Managing for Excellence and Business Standards for Asset and Maintenance Management.

CARMA provides strategic approach to asset management and the overarching goals of delivery reliability, cost, effectiveness, safety and security, and Western Interconnection support. Support for NERC compliance for Reclamation s Power Facilities is performed by CARMA. This includes support to five national critical infrastructure (NCI) facilities (Glen Canyon Dam, Shasta Dam, Folsom Dam, Grand Coulee Dam, and Hoover Dam).
 
In 2015, Reclamation completed the process of upgrading to MAXIMO 7.5.0.3 on July 17 as part of the Department's Project to upgrade all bureaus to MAXIMO 7 (Mu2).  While each bureau still maintains their own MAXIMO infrastructure, all bureaus are working together to gain Department approval for future upgrades. Working together, and staying identical major-versions of MAXIMO increases success of a move to a cloud solution if the Department decides to move in that direction.

In 2017, the Department of the Interior (DOI) established an Operations Board to address and establish consistent asset management across DOI bureaus. All upgrades to bureau Facility Maintenance Systems are to be approved by the Operations Board.  In 2017, the Operations Board approved an upgrade to Maximo v7.6.0.8.  Reclamation's upgrade is currently underway with anticipated completion in May 2018.","010APG18021 - Improve Condition of Priority Assets Necessary for Mission Delivery Across the Department of the Interior","ROI was evaluated on the initial investment that was projected to reduce the cost of individual databases along with having a payoff within five years of investment, ending in FY2014.  In general the overall investment has reduced the long-term costs, Reclamation-wide, by approximately two-thirds resulting in a positive ROI.

EFMSS consists of approximately 21 interrelated systems and applications, many of which interface with an instance of Maximo, a commercial-off-the-shelf asset management software.This EFMSS portfolio of systems and applications provides NPS with an asset-based work identification, planning, management, and analysis program through its interface with FMMS. EFMSS allows users to access the entire NPS inventory of more than 70,000 assets and over 1.6 million work orders used by NPS units to track and manage work. This ""cradle to grave"" asset and work management system allows a park, region or Washington Area Support Office to track all aspects of work related to a specific asset; such as planning, design, construction, operations/maintenance, rehab, and removal. Primary beneficiaries include end users such as park and regional staff, PFMD, Agency, Department and external key stakeholders. The EFMSS is helping the NPS to meet the following critical objectives:

Generate Information Technology (IT) Cost Savings for NPS 
  Consolidated functions and administration help reduce overhead IT costs for the NPS, as EFMSS eliminates the need for each region and/or program to have its own asset management system at additional costs.

Promote an Enterprise Asset Management Program
  The enterprise program links together many disparate systems, encouraging collaboration with the NPS planning function, land management, construction, interpretation and education, natural and cultural resource management, and the Budget Office. 

Benefit the End User Park Staff, Stakeholders, and Visitors
  The system focuses emphasis on proactive work management and using the system to track and manage work more efficiently, allocating resources to the highest priority assets in each park portfolio, with an emphasis on assets that are critical to the NPS mission.","010SO18255 - Prioritize DOI infrastructure needs and reduce deferred maintenance backlog","The EFMSS enables the PFMD to capture and manage its inventory using industry-standard principles, business practices, and life-cycle costs. The EFMSS houses the NPS s real property asset data and has 21 interrelated applications and systems that rely on the corresponding software, hardware, user input, and technical support. 

The EFMSS is helping the NPS to meeting the following critical objectives:

Generate Information Technology (IT) Cost Savings for NPS
Through consolidation of business and administrative functions, EFMSS helps reduce overhead IT costs. The PFMD has taken the lead role in establishing a robust asset management system, thereby eliminating the need for each region and/or program to have its own system at additional costs.

Promote an Enterprise Asset Management Program
Maximo serves as the cornerstone of the NPS AMP, allowing parks to inventory their asset portfolio, track asset condition, generate work orders, and record time and cost required to complete work activities. The enterprise program links together many disparate systems, encouraging a more holistic view of asset management capital investment, including collaboration with the NPS planning function, land management, construction, interpretation and education, natural and cultural resource management, and the Budget Office. 

Benefit the End User   Park Staff, Stakeholders, and Visitors
The system focuses emphasis on proactive work management and using the system to track and manage work more efficiently, allocating resources to the highest priority assets in each park portfolio, with an emphasis on those assets that are critical to the NPS mission. The EFMSS offers greater functionality and use than stand-alone systems, increasing park efficiency.

Achieve Transparency and Accountability
The EFMSS acts as the system of record to meet the following reporting requests: federal real property (FRP) to the DOI/General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and NPS budget requests, among others. The system provides real-time responses to OMB questions and congressional inquiries. EFMSS leverages asset, equipment, and work order data to provide quarterly performance metric updates and set out-year targets. The system is essential for developing a long-range capital investment strategy and forecasting cyclic maintenance requirements.","Legislative Mandates: Section 4(a) of PL 98-540 (16 USC 1a-8(a)) directs the NPS to implement a Maintenance Management System to support the maintenance and operations programs of the National Park System. Additionally, this system is necessary to enable NPS to comply with congressional directives, executive orders, and Directors orders. Section 111(a) of PL 109-58 requires the Secretary of the Interior to incorporate energy efficient technologies in public and administrative buildings associated with management of the National Park System. The EFMSS supports this requirement by assisting NPS with the facility management process, directing funding towards critical assets and providing for maintenance that both improves efficiency and extends the assets lifecycle.  

Outstanding Audit Finding or Material Weakness: Federal real property was identified as a high risk area by GAO. Additionally AOC audits have been conducted underscoring the value and need for an industry standard product such as Maximo (a core component of NPS's EFMSS) to ensure NPS is using industry best practices to manage, maintain, and determine future requirements for its complex asset inventory.  

Presidential Direction (i.e. Presidential Directive, Presidential Memorandum, or Executive Order): Executive Order (EO) 13327, Federal Real Property Asset Management, directs DOI to implement an agency asset management process to promote the efficient and economical use of Federal real property resources, including the development or upgrade of Federal real property information systems.EO 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, directs agencies to implement high performance sustainable Federal buildings operation and management, maintenance, and deconstruction.EO 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, instructs agencies to conduct activities in an economically sound and efficient manner, including by implementing sustainable practices for high performance construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings.

These services support NSF business processes, providing effective mission-support technology solutions for NSF's annual processing of approximately 50,000 proposals. NSF program staff leverage electronic capabilities to act on every proposal received (to withdraw, decline, or award) as they formulate and announce program opportunities; accept proposals; conduct the merit review process; make awards to fund proposals that have been judged the most promising by the rigorous and objective merit-review process; monitor program performance and results; and disseminate results of NSF-funded research. 
 
MSS capabilities are essential to carrying out NSF's mission in an efficient manner and go far beyond automation of paper-based business processes. Modernization initiatives, with a dual focus on user-centric design and facilitating capture of and access to quality information in the data layer, support the use of advanced technologies to increase NSF staff efficiency. In addition to eliminating paper-based processes, they provide for lower operational cost, greater flexibility, increased capabilities, and faster deployments. 
 
MSS capabilities support improved interaction between NSF and the organizations that submit grant applications to NSF and receive grant awards. Tools include: Research Spending and Results (RS&R), enabling organizations and the public access to information on how NSF grant award dollars are being spent; Award Cash Management Service (ACMS), for awardee institutions to submit cash requests to NSF and view real-time award financial data; Grant Application Status, allowing Principal Investigators (PIs) to check the status of submitted grant applications; Project Outcomes Reporting (POR), for the PI to provide the public a brief summary for the public that describes the intellectual meritand broader impacts of NSF-funded research; Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPR), providing federally-funded researchers the ability to submit federally-mandated progress reports; and NSF’s Public Access Repository (NSF-PAR), increasing public access to NSF data while reducing the burden on the research community to submit publications.","422SO18171 - Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations","NSF’s Mission Support Systems, which include applications for grants management, proposal submission, panel reviews, award recommendations, and award confirmation, are central to NSF’s Merit Review process.

CODIS is the generic term used to describe the FBI's program of support for criminal justice DNA databases as well as the software used to run these databases. The National DNA Index System or NDIS is considered one part of CODIS, the national level, containing the DNA profiles contributed by federal, state, and local participating forensic laboratories.  This automated DNA information processing and telecommunications system generates potential investigative leads in cases where biological evidence (DNA) is recovered.  CODIS links crime scene evidence to other crimes and/or offenders which helps identify serial offenders and/or potential suspects.  In addition, CODIS software supports missing person DNA searches as well as disaster victim identification. The CODIS Program started as a pilot project in 1990 with ten laboratories. The Federal DNA Identification Act of 1994 authorized the establishment of a national DNA identification index and in October 1998, NDIS became operational.  All 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice Crime Laboratories, the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Laboratory, and Puerto Rico participate in NDIS.  The CODIS Unit serves approximately 200 NDIS participating laboratories across the US and more than 90 international laboratories representing over 50 countries.  As of August 2018, NDIS contains over 17 million searchable DNA profiles and has aided over 415,000 investigations.  Reliability and expandability of CODIS are critical in the FBI's ability to effectively aid law enforcement investigations and serve the public through the use of biometrics. CODIS has no dependencies between this or any other investments.","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime","As the CODIS Program is an established system, the return on investment for its original development, and for the re-architecture of the CODIS software as Next Generation CODIS (NGCODIS 6.0/7.0) have been achieved.   The resulting reductions in routine search times allows local and state lab's resources to manage their workload more efficiently, and in the case of some crimes, time is of the essence, so faster response times often make a difference in solving a case, and cannot be measured in quantitative terms.  The incorporation of Missing Persons identification functionality within NGCODIS 6.0 has provided and continues to provide further immeasurable qualitative benefit to the public, domestic and internationally, whenever a missing person identification is made.  With rapidly deployable software at the ready, crisis support has become easier and has and will continue to assist in mass disaster identification (such as the Bangladesh garment district building collapse, Air France Flight 447 and the Victorian Brushfires in Australia.)  The CODIS Program has also continually looked for ways to control operational costs to further promote return-on-investment.  Examples of this include the adoption of a Computer Based Training model, which dramatically reduced the travel and administrative cost to the Government to provide instructor-led end user training.  Additional enhancements related to technical improvements in searching methodologies, functionality related to new scientific advances, and other refinements are being implemented to continue to increase system functionality, streamline operational deployments and service delivery, and improve performance and reliability.  To date, CODIS has aided in over 415,000 investigations.","CODIS currently meets all required legislative mandates, which translate into system and software performance requirements for the CODIS software.  In 1994, the DNA Identification Act (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title42/pdf/USCODE-2010-title42-chap136-subchapIX-partA-sec14132.pdf) formalized the FBI's authority to establish a National DNA Index System (NDIS) for law enforcement purposes.

The program's goals are to: Stimulate technological innovation; Meet Federal research and development needs; Foster and encourage innovation and entrepreneurship; and Increase private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and development funding. The SBIR/STTR program helps small businesses develop innovations to meet the research and development needs of the federal government and then commercialize those innovations in the marketplace. In addition to helping meet federal research and development needs, the SBIR can advance American innovation and competitiveness in the broader economy.

The role of the SBA is to oversee and coordinate the efforts of the eleven (11) participating agencies in the SBIR/STTR program. The SBA coordinates the solicitation schedules at the participating agencies, and collects and maintains data that is required to assess the SBIR/STTR program and report to the U.S. Congress. The SBA's core responsibility consists of reporting number of awards, amount of money spent and/or put aside for small business set asides. 

The purpose of this investment is to meet statutory requirements for the STTR/SBIR program through an enhanced database(s) (both public facing and federal access only) and development of the SBIR.gov business intelligence database platform system; to provide a central repository for interested stakeholders to learn about the SBIR/STTR program and solicitations, and to provide value for companies in Phases I-III of the program.","028SO18186 - Expand Access to Capital, 028SO18191 - Create a Small Business Friendly Environment, 028SO18195 - Implement Enterprise-wide Information System Modernization and Cost-effective Technology","The SBIR investment is a one-stop site for all SBIR/STTR program related information. It is an integrated repository of program data that facilitates SBIR program evaluation and reporting across the 11 participating Federal agencies. With the automation of agencies Annual Reports, enhancements to the SBIR.gov portal and the integration of the previous enhanced TechNet database into SBIR.gov, the SBIR investment provides a secure, web based electronic system for the collection of Commercialization Phase III, Non-Awardee, and Phase I and II information as mandated by Congress. The platform is used to collect and host proposals, awards granted and proposals submitted by participating agencies and to provide transparency to mitigate fraud, waste and abuse with in the program.  

The recently added Company Registry is a new element of the SBIR/STTR data system that facilitates the application process and reduces the need for multiple data entry. Having one central registry helps coordinate data collection across agencies, and will save small businesses from having to input the same data across different agencies, across different years. The result will be shortened timelines for application evaluation and award notification.

With more support for Commercialization efforts, enhanced provisions for Phase III transitions, greater reporting from agencies for increased accountability in the program and stronger measures to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the program, the SBIR investment demonstrates an excellent return on investment for the government.

This system will be in an ongoing development in order to maintain compliance with OMB, SBA, and Congressional requirements, due to the yearly data updates from the 11 participating federal agencies.

The system represents the AF commitment to modernizing business practices and providing enhanced support for today's service members and their families. AFIPPS will align with DoD data standards for personnel, pay, and accounting, including the Common Human Resource Information Standards (CHRIS), which will ensure compliance with the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). The AFIPPS program will be bound by using the BEA ""Hire-to-Retire"" (H2R) construct. Eighty-four percent of the BEA's H2R activities are within the scope of AFIPPS.

The purpose of AFIPPS is to provide the AF with a sustainable, cost-effective, auditable, and regulatory compliant method of effectively capturing and maintaining personnel information so that Service members are paid accurately and on-time without requiring repetitive action or onerous paperwork, while allowing commanders/managers to easily access pertinent information.

The goal of AFIPPS, as documented in the Capability Development Document (CDD) signed 05 Jul 11, is to fully integrate personnel and pay management for the AF's Total Force (Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFRes)). The future state will be characterized by streamlined, Total Force business processes; efficient and accurate management of pay entitlements; auditable financial statements with regard to military pay; improved access to accurate and timely personnel data for authorized users; and a modernized IT systems environment that is cost-effective and can adapt to future needs.

AFIPPS's customers include approximately 620,000 AF Service members across all components, as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure Service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.  Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained..","007SO18273 - Improve and strengthen business operations through a move to DoD-enterprise or shared services; reduce administrative and regulatory burden","The AFIPPS PMO is in the process of the performing an Economic Analysis to measure the quantitative and qualitative benefits that will be achieved through investment in AFIPPS.  The final Return on Investment, as well as the Break-even Year, the Cost/Benefit Ratio and the investment NPV, will be included in the final analysis which is scheduled to be submitted to OSD CAPE in Q1 FY16.

The AFIPPS ROI is calculated as the return divided by the investment, where:
-Return is the present value of the total savings generated by the investment in AFIPPS (annual net difference between Status Quo and AFIPPS O&S costs), plus benefits over the post-FD period of analysis, and
-Investment is the present value of the AFIPPS acquisition costs through FD (excluding sunk costs) 

The overall goal of AFIPPS is to provide fully integrated personnel and pay capability across the Total Force.  AFIPPS will partially or fully subsume more than 20 legacy personnel and pay systems, including MilPDS (pers) and DJMS (pay).  AFIPPS will eliminate today's ""split"" between Personnel and Pay business and IT processes, reduce system operating costs, and will improve compensation accuracy (reduce pay errors). AFIPPS will also enable AF compliance with the Congressionally-mandated audit readiness (Federal Financial Management Improvement Act and Federal accounting standards) and support the Secretary of the AF (SECAF) ""3 to 1"" initiative integrating the AF Component Management Systems.
.","""Development of the Air Force Integrated Personnel & Pay System is being developed to resolve the consistent pay issues stemming from DFAS's legacy systems and will be FIAR and audit compliant.  AFIPPS also supports the 2014 National Commission on the Structure of the Armed Forces Recommendation #35 ""Integrated Pay and Personnel System"" and Recommendation #38 ""PERSTEMPO"".
Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) will be a web-enabled, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will integrate existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) plans to accomplish this goal by modernizing existing technology, resulting in a secure and authoritative data environment that improves accuracy, strengthens decision making and reduces processing time and costs. AFIPPS supports effective military personnel management and development throughout the lifecycle of all military members, by providing an accurate and single authoritative source of personnel data. Active (RegAF), National Guard (ANG), and Reserve (AFRes) components will integrate personnel and pay functionality; streamline and improve automated support to the mobilization and deployment processes; and implement standard data that reflects the core requirements of the Combatant Commands, the Department of the Air Force, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other federal agencies.
Congress, the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions on how the US military is organized, operated, maintained, and funded. The AFIPPS program will ensure accurate and timely delivery of pay, entitlements, allowances, and benefits information is provided for the Total Force (Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve). AFIPPS represents the AF commitment to modernize business practices and provide enhanced support to service members and their families by integrating personnel and pay systems. AFIPPS will eliminate AF reliance on the end-of-life/unsustainable Defense Finance and Accounting (DFAS) Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) for payroll processing and will ensure continued/improved auditability of service member pay.

The overall purpose of the program is to address and modernize the air traffic voice channels for aircraft flying in the Terminal and Flight Services environment (below 24,000 feet) of the National Airspace System (NAS). ATC is provided in the NAS by a combination of control and remote facilities. Control facilities are assigned specific airspace responsibilities over which to provide ATC services. Associated with each control facility are remote communications facilities (RCFs) where radios are located. Remote transmitter/receiver (RTR) locations provide a service for Terminal airspace. In some instances, the FAA retains control of remote communications outlets (RCOs) associated with flight services control facilities (AFSS/FSS). RCOs provide flight planning and advisory services. NEXCOM Segment 2 will focus on replacing air to ground voice communication radios at 1,946 RTR and RCO sites. The program expects completion by 2027. The modernization of key A/G elements, such as VHF (Very High Frequency) and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) radios, antennas and cabling, under NEXCOM Segment 2 will ensure the continued operation of the ATC system. NEXCOM Segment 2 received a Final Investment Decision in September 2011. NEXCOM Segment 2's program management team and contract officers awarded the prime radio contract in April 2012. Pilots, air traffic controllers, and FAA operations and maintenance are the key beneficiaries of this program. The flying public also greatly benefits once the modernized radios are deployed throughout the NAS as pilots and air traffic controllers can handle increased ATC traffic which should decrease delays.","021APG18095 - Improve Conditions of America's Transportation Related Infrastructure","NEXCOM Segment 2 will insert the latest radio technology into the NAS and replace the old radios that are now failing and whose parts are obsolete. By replacing these old radios, NEXCOM Segment 2 is reducing the future increase in O&M costs (radio maintenance, radio repair), which is a cost avoidance. Additionally, the radios will provide sufficient spectrum capacity in the A/G Communications band and meet systems operational performance availability for voice communications. With more planes flying during peak periods and Air Traffic Controllers becoming empowered to work more efficiently, more radio spectrum will be needed for Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications; either for more voice, data, Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) technologies or a combination of these. The planned capabilities of the NEXCOM Segment 2 program include: VHF radio capable of operating with 8.33 kHz channel spacing to increase frequency spectrum capacity, reduce susceptibility to radio frequency interference, provide consistent voice quality over a range of operating conditions, and provide Voice over IP (VoIP) support for other FAA programs.

ANICS is an FAA owned and operated satellite network that provides Alaska with critical, essential, and routine air traffic control telecommunications services. ANICS uses primary and alternate satellites to meet FAA Order 6.36 to provide system circuit diversity and redundancy. ANICS availability has fallen below required availability and continues to decline. Outages are increasing in both frequency and duration. Many system components have either reached the end of their useful life or are no longer supportable. The arctic climate degrades the equipment due to cold cycling, corrosion, and wind damage. Conditions have led to a loss of performance capability, increased maintenance and higher costs of ownership. The Network Management and Control System (NMCS) does not provide the level of security assurance that current Federal standards demand. ASTI supports the DOT and FAA strategic goal of Safety by improving availability and reliability performance statistics. Air safety is improved by minimizing outages for critical and essential communications links between pilots and air traffic controllers, but current system availability has fallen below required standards. ASTI will achieve its objective by acquiring and providing Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment, COTS Replacement for the ASTI NMCS and associated support services. The modernization efforts will yield several important benefits: Improvements in network availability to required levels; Improved information system security to meet Federal standards; Reduced frequency and duration of outages; More efficient use of satellite transponder bandwidth; Containment of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs; and Improved life cycle support (i.e., training, second level engineering support, radome maintenance and department level supplysupport).

This infrastructure is a foundational worldwide information system that supports roughly 450 domestic and international offices. Firebird provides access to DEA's Information Technology, mission critical applications, office automation, information management functions, investigative tools, and electronic communications that comprise the Firebird Sensitive-But-Unclassified (SBU) computing infrastructure.

Firebird resources support DEA s mission requirements and are applied across DEA. Firebird supports a user base of 15,900+ personnel across the globe.  Enterprise-wide applications include; centralized/consolidated/shared web hosting; housing; content management; Enterprise-wide services and office automation tools; E-mail management; System administration policies; testing & integration services; E-forms; workflow; and intranet portals.

Firebird transformed DEA s multiple IT infrastructures into a federated management and shared-service Common Operating Environment (COE) that services DEA s enterprise including agents, diversion investigators, lab personnel, intelligence analysts, financial, administrative support staff, senior management, task officers and contractors.

This investment supports DEA s strategic goals of Disrupting and Dismantling International and Domestic Priority Target Organizations; Attack Financial Infrastructure of Drug Trafficking Organizations; Assisting State and Local Agencies and Foreign Law Enforcement Counterparts with Drug Enforcement; and Reducing the Diversion of Legal Drugs into the Illicit Market. Firebird operates at a reduced cost by providing a centralized IT infrastructure that effectively supports DEA s operations and business functions. 

The consolidated infrastructure supports DEA s strategic goals by striving to reduce the overall IT ownership costs, improve user experience, protect DEA s critical infrastructure and data, modernize DEA s IT systems, and develop programs that support IT governance and Federal mandates. Throughout the management of this critical service, DEA continues to monitor and update Firebird service capabilities to ensure that they align to industry best practices, metrics, and costs.","011SO18282 - Disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations to curb opioid and other illicit drug use in our nation","The Firebird program has been in the operations and maintenance phase since 2003.  Among the key benefits realized by the investment is its Tech Refreshment initiative allowing the architecture to remain vibrant, robust, and current without significant change in the program scope.   This has enabled DEA personnel to keep pace with available technologies while sustaining a high network and server availability rate consistently in excess of 99.8%.  Current initiatives involve an enhanced Unified Communication Systems, PIV Enabling Privileged Accounts, improved Printer Management, efficient network storage utilization, enhanced disaster recovery capability, modernization of the network infrastructure, and extended secure remote access capabilities in support of an increasingly mobile user base across the globe.

This requirement is mandated in the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 2,  The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years  and the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2,  Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State 
The purpose of the 2020 Census Program is to conduct a census of population and housing and disseminate the results to the President, the states, and the American people. The goal of the 2020 Census is to count everyone once, only once, and in the right place.  

The decennial census data must meet high quality standards to ensure good decision-making and to continue building confidence in the government, society, and the economy. Studying the balance between cost and quality is an important focus of the census design.

Decennial data at the census block level are used by governmental entities for redistricting, i.e., defining the representative boundaries for congressional districts, state legislative districts, school districts, and voting precincts. Additionally, decennial data are used to enforce voting rights and civil rights legislation.

The Census Bureau also uses the decennial census results to determine the statistical sampling frames for the American Community Survey (ACS), which replaced the long form in the decennial census and is part of the Decennial Program, and the dozens of current surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. The results of these surveys are used to support important government functions such as appropriating federal funds to local communities (an estimated $400 billion annually); producing monthly unemployment, crime, and poverty rates; and publishing health and education data.
 Finally, decennial data play an increasingly important role in United States commerce and the economy. As people expand their use of data to make decisions at the local and national levels, they increasingly depend on data from the Census Bureau to make these decisions.","006APG18077 - Prepare to Conduct a Complete and Accurate 2020 Decennial Census, 006SO18033 - Conduct a Full, Fair, and Accurate Decennial Census, 006SO18250 - Conduct a Complete and Accurate Decennial Census","The Census Bureau has a goal of conducting the 2020 Census at a cost less per housing unit than the 2010 Census (adjusted for inflation) while maintaining quality. In order to meet this goal, the Census Bureau has invested early in our research and testing.  Our goal is to achieve an innovative 2020 Census design while minimizing risk and reducing workloads for costly follow-up operations.  The 2010 Census cost approximately $94 per housing unit.  If we are not able to find cost savings innovations, the cost per housing unit of the 2020 Census will rise just over 50% to approximately $148 per housing unit.    

The rising costs of the Census are driven by several factors but the biggest factor is the cost of field operations.  The work in 2016 focused on obtaining evidence around ways to reduce the workloads that then translate into lower staffing and smaller support infrastructures.  Specific focus areas included reducing the workloads for canvassing addresses prior to the census and the workload for following up for housing units that do not provide a self-response.  In 2017, we began development of solutions needed to support operations for the 2020 Census.  We also validated and refined the design by testing the interactions across operations and determining the proposed methodology for the operations in two field tests. We prioritized spending in FY 2017 to ensure our systems readiness for the 2018 End-to-End Census Test. Within our appropriated spending levels we made decisions to delay or re-plan certain areas of the operation to optimally allow this to occur while mitigating risk. These efforts culminate with the full-scale End-to-End Test conducted in 2018 ensuring all census operations and supporting systems can be successfully integrated on a large scale, folding in final design changes prior to executing the census.","Legislative Mandate, The Constitution of the United States directs that the population be enumerated at least once every

One currently deployed module, the Energy Compensation System (ECS) will be replaced eventually by the new core system. The other existing modules address functions that were needed by one or more of the program offices and will be part of the finished OWCS.  These include: the OWCP Imaging System (OIS), the OWCP Unified Report System (OURS), the Case Correspondence and Tracking System (CCAT), and OWCP Connect. The core workers compensation component of OWCS will speed delivery of income support to specified workers compensation claimants by improving claims intake and processing, automating the review of claims, and improving processing efficiency. OWCS will improve service responsiveness and the quality and volume of information provided to program stakeholders, that include claimants, beneficiaries, businesses, and Congress. It will also enable better tracking of workloads; and make the programs more effective overall. The impact will be reflected in improved benefit delivery for Longshore and more timely eligibility decisions for Black Lung claimants affected by black lung disease. 

This investment supports DOL Strategic Goal 4: Secure retirement, health, and other employee benefits and, for those not working, provide income security. Specifically Strategic Objective 4.1, Provide income support when work is impossible or unavailable and facilitate return to work. 

Primary customers include coal miners, longshoremen, federal government workers, government contractors injured overseas, energy workers exposed to certain materials, mine owners, and federal agencies whose illness, injury, and disability claims will be processed by OWCS. 

The first task order for development of the core system began in May 2017.  Longshore will be deployed in May 2019 with iFECS to follow two years later, Black Lung a year after that, and Energy approximately 18 month after that.","012SO18073 - Provide workers' compensation benefits for workers who are injured or become ill on the job.","After all four of OWCP's existing stovepipe systems have been integrated an overall reduction in operations and maintenance team costs of 35.17% is expected. As OWCS has been developing modules over the last few years some benefits have already been realized, including a one time cost avoidance of $750,000 by leveraging the iFECS imaging component as the base module for the development of OIS.  OIS creation has allowed the Longshore program to reduce contractor staff who processed mail and claims documents saving $210,000 per year in reduced contractor costs.  This investment is projecting an ROI of 24.9% and a Payback Period of 8 years.  External Benefits include Public Access to Information and Postage Savings from Electronic Submission.  Internal benefits include a reduction in claims errors, reduction recalculating benefits and reduction in time for forms entry. The OIS and eCLAIMANT Portals in OWCS have allowed a very short staffed and low funded Longshore program to set a goal of receiving at least 60 percent of all claim related documents in digital format.  This will save the program money on contractors to scan documents, and allow for faster response times in processing claims.  This benefit in faster claims service is being seen throughout OWCP's programs due to the increase in the use of OIS to file claims and the eCLAIMANT Portals to upload documents electronically to support claims.","This program will address the requirements for all four of OWCP's program offices.

The NCIC became operational on January 27, 1967, with the goal of assisting law enforcement in apprehending fugitives and locating stolen property.  This goal has since expanded to include locating missing persons and further protecting law enforcement personnel and the public.  

Participation in NCIC is voluntary except for a few legislatively mandated files. NCIC is reliant upon state, local, federal, and tribal law enforcement agencies to enter records.  

The mission of the NCIC is to help criminal justice professionals apprehend fugitives, locate missing persons, recover stolen property, and identify terrorists.  In addition, the NCIC assists law enforcement officers in performing their official duties safely and provides them with information necessary to aid in protecting the general public.  The NCIC Program also supports the FBI s priorities to protect the United States from a terrorist attack; support municipal, county, state, federal, tribal, and international partners; combat transnational and national crime organizations and enterprises; combat significant violent crime; and upgrade technology to successfully perform the FBI s mission.  NCIC provides law enforcement on the street with the facts they need when they need them.  NCIC contains over 15.2 million active records and processes an average of 10.3 million transactions a day.  

The last major upgrade to NCIC occurred in July 1999, with the NCIC 2000 project.  In order to meet NCIC stakeholder requirements, the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division has implemented many system/technical enhancements since July 1999.  As the lifecycle of the current technology deployed in NCIC 2000 nears its end, the CJIS Division is preparing for the next major upgrade to NCIC known as NCIC 3rd Generation (N3G).  As the premier national criminal justice database, the NCIC has long operated in a technologically challenging environment.  The third generation of NCIC promises to be no different and will require close collaboration between policy makers, users, and technology professionals both inside and outside of the FBI.","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime","The NCIC System provides a timely and accurate database of criminal justice information to local, state, tribal, and federal criminal justice agencies.  The information supplied by the NCIC System is critical, supporting local, state, tribal, and federal criminal justice and law enforcement agencies.  This information is used for the compilation, dissemination, and exchange of time critical criminal justice and law enforcement information.  The FBI is charged by Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 20, as manager of the system.  Inclusive in the system is the host computer and associated equipment located at the CJIS Division's main facility in Clarksburg, WV, and the disaster recovery system located at Pocatello, ID.

The operational availability of the NCIC System for the law enforcement and criminal justice communities is vital to the CJIS Division's customer base.  The safety of law enforcement personnel and the public depends upon this availability.  This commitment to customer service is reflected in the CJIS Division's mission:

""To equip our partners with the criminal justice information they need to protect the United States while protecting civil liberties.""

The NCIC System serves criminal justice agencies in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, U.S. Territories, and Canada, as well as federal criminal justice agencies.  The NCIC System is available to criminal justice agencies through established law enforcement systems.  Additionally, specific foreign agencies have access to NCIC data provided through the INTERPOL United States National Central Bureau.

For local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement who need fast access to actionable criminal justice information from outside their jurisdiction, the NCIC System provides fast, actionable, cross-jurisdictional, biographic, criminal justice information 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

The vision and purpose of the NCIC System is to provide near real-time criminal justice information to its more than 90,000 plus users.  This information supports the combat against crime and loss of property, as well as the safety of officers all across the nation.  Through the maintenance of approximately 15.2 million active records in 21 different files, the NCIC System completes on average 10.3 million transactions per day in less than a second.

Even with astounding statistics, modernizing the NCIC system is necessary because of the many functions used by our law enforcement partners today were originally developed back in the 1960's on 1960's technology.  As time has passed, many federal, state, and local partners have upgraded systems that surpass the technology provided by the NCIC System forcing those agencies to maintain old technology so they can still receive NCIC data.

The modernization solution features the use of the NIEM XML; enhancing biographic identification through a suite of modern tools and services, such as enhanced image and testing capabilities; new files, fields and codes; improved data management; maximizing the use of data through new search capabilities and name search algorithm.","Legislative Mandate:  NCIC was built in accordance with Title 28, U.S.C.

BIS's activities include regulating the export of sensitive goods and technologies in an effective and efficient manner; enforcing export control, anti-boycott, and public safety laws; cooperating with and assisting other countries on export control and strategic trade issues; assisting U.S. industry to comply with international arms control agreements; and monitoring the viability of the U.S. defense industrial base and seeking to ensure that it is capable of satisfying U.S. national and homeland security needs.

CUESS is a BIS mission-critical system consisting of subsystems that were originally deployed as early as 2006, along with new subsystems to support functionality that is not being migrated to the Department of Defense (DOD) USXPORTS system.  It supports business processes related to export license administration and export enforcement.  These processes include issuing commodity classifications, processing export license applications, granting licenses, and managing investigations and export enforcement cases.

On January 27, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama stated during his State of the Union address that his administration would embark on a new National Export Initiative that would make reform of the U.S. export control system a top priority.  On April 20, 2010, DOD Secretary Robert Gates called on Congress to approve the president s plan for reforming export controls, including the creation of a single control list, single primary enforcement coordination agency, a single information system.  The DOD USXPORTS system was chosen to centralize and modernize the U.S. export licensing community, and thus improve the U.S. export licensing process in order to meet national security, foreign policy, and nonproliferation objectives while facilitating trade and business expansion.","006SO18027 - Increase U.S. Exports, 006SO18029 - Enforce the Nation's Trade Laws and Security Laws","i.

Studies have demonstrated that the most common call to the help desk staff is for password resets, the second most common call is for unsuccessful certificate updates performed while connected via VPN.  HHS staff has become comfortable using their PIV card to access a broad range of systems and due to the frequency of update seldom need PIN resets.  The number of PIN resets is now a fraction of the number of help desk calls received collectively across all supported systems.  Individual applications no longer receive calls to reset passwords for systems that mandate the use of the PIV card and therefore no longer use passwords.  Help desk calls at the HHS level have significantly reduced to 15% in FY 18.  The value of a single credential and PIN cannot be overstated.

RASS currently consists of the Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS) and the Risk Adjustment System (RAS). The RAPS User Interface (UI) and the Adjusted Monthly Membership Report (AMMR) Process System, as well as the Interface to the Integrated Data Repository (IDR).  The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) Diagnosis Codes have been integrated into the RASS.
The RAPS application performs daily edit/update functions on Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) beneficiary diagnosis data input files received through the Front End Risk Adjustment System (FERAS). These diagnoses are used by the RAS application for the Risk Adjustment model run process. RAS receives Fee-for-Service (FFS) diagnostic information from the National Medicare Utilization Database (NMUD) and MA diagnostic information from RAPS and beneficiary data; calculates Risk Adjustment Factors (RAFs); and feeds the RAFs to MARx for computing Prospective Payments. 

The investment secures the resources needed to operate and maintain these systems within FISMA compliance and within CMS requirements.  Resources are allocated to maintain and update, test and monitor the operation of the systems that support the Risk Adjustment Data Collection functions, as well as provide related audit and compliance support, program management support and customer service to relevant stakeholders.","009SO18206 - Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, 009SO18220 - Ensure responsible financial management, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","This investment funds the Risk Adjustment Suite of Systems (RASS).  The Risk Adjustment Suite of Systems (RASS) was implemented to receive, process, store risk adjustment data, and use the HCC and Part D models developed by CMS, to calculate risk scores used to risk-adjust MA plan payments. RASS, which resides under the Medicare Enrollment & Payment Systems (MEPS) suite serves the following business functions:  Receives, processes, and stores Medicare Advantage enrollee diagnoses data received from MAOs;; Extracts and filters MA and FFS diagnoses data from their respective source systems;Creates risk scores for all Medicare enrollees, both in FFS and MA, which represent relative weights of predicted health risks based on each enrollee’s past claim history data and demographics;
Provides risk scores  to MARx for payment calculations; Coordinates with the IDR to load risk adjustment run data in the IDR; and Generates reports and analyses of risk scores for CMS and MAOs.

Each year, the RASS must process diagnoses to calculate and store multiple risk scores for each of the Medicare beneficiaries. CMS’ risk-adjusted payment rules require the RASS to apply a range of risk adjustment models and model segments specific to each program and each payment year.  In addition, beneficiaries may change model-relevant statuses during a payment year. To accomplish accurate calculation and transmission of risk scores, the RASS must interface with multiple other CMS upstream and downstream systems.

 
Proposed modernization to RASS  requires a large-scale, efficient approach to systems management; especially validation work that is informed by a careful, deliberate approach to continuous quality improvement efforts. RASS moving to the cloud will demonstrate scalable and cost-effective AWS approach that results in significant reduction in processing elapsed time and enabling key tangible capabilities such as horizontally scaling, at commodity rates and a raw data landing zone for acceleration.

This investment also funds the four Front End Systems (FES).  The four FES component systems are:

1.       Encounter Data System Front End System (EDFES)
2.       Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS)
3.       Prescription Drug Front End System (PDFS)
4.       Medicare Medicaid Plans (MMPs) Front End System

The FES takes in and processes all Medicare Part C and Part D program data records 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

The FES also is responsible for feeding accurate and timely data to downstream systems that generate payments for the Medicare Advantage Part C program, the Part D program, and the Medicare-Medicaid plan demonstration program, as well as to a downstream data warehouse that is the data source for demonstration evaluators. Currently, Part C and D program payments are about $250 billion a year for items and services provided to about 18 million Part C beneficiaries receiving medical services through Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and about 40 million Fee-for- Service and Part C beneficiaries receiving prescription drugs through Part D plans.
The Consolidated Support Services portion of this investment supports CMS in management and delivery of Encounter Data related work. As part of the FY18 period of performance begin development of a tool to aid the key work streams under the Consolidated Support Services Contract. With a slated release in late FY18 and early FY19 CMS anticipates efficiency gains in day to day work.","CMS administers risk adjusted payments to MA orgs according to Subpart G of 42 CFR §422.304. This regulatory provision is based on sections 1853, 1854, and 1858 of the Act. CMS risk adjusts Part C payments to MA plans under Section 1853(a) (3) of the Act; these rules are codified at 42 CFR 422.310.

The investment budget supports the operational and technical functions of administering Part C and Part D risk adjustment payments that are made to Medicare
Advantage (MA) and MA-Prescription Drug Plans (MA-PD). Part C risk adjustment payments are applied to approximately 16+ million Medicare beneficiaries
who are enrolled in managed care, and Part D risk adjustment payments applicable to the prescription drug benefit are applied to approximately 36 million
beneficiaries. The program has instituted a series of annual payment reconciliation runs that has allowed CMS to collect over 1 Billion dollars in
overpayments in the last eighteen (18) months. This budget request supports the Risk Adjustment System (RAS) enhancements to allow for the automation
of the overpayment regulation in Fiscal Year 2017 and beyond.

The STC tests national coverage determinations (NCD) for each maintainer. The NCD’s reflect national health policy. STC does not test local coverage determinations (LCD) because they are determined by each MAC.

 

CMS sometimes develops policies to limit Medicare coverage of specific items and services. MACs issue local coverage determinations (LCDs) that limit coverage for a particular item or service in their jurisdictions only. The MAC (users) test their local/unique components and conduct a limited, end-to-end, operational test.

L.111-148), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L.111-152), amended certain provisions of Pub. L.111-148, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act. ACA includes a number of provisions designed to improve the quality of Medicare services: to expand value-based purchasing; broaden quality reporting; improve the level of performance feedback available to providers; and create incentives to enhance quality, improve beneficiary outcomes, and increase the value of care. Section 3022 of ACA called for the establishment of the Medicare Shared Savings Program SSP by January 1, 2012, which supports the development of Accountable Care Organizations . Section 3021 of ACA established and authorized the Innovation Center to test new payment and service delivery models that have the potential to improve quality and reduce costs.


This investment provides technical assistance support for CMS to implement the financial and quality performance determination for a number of ACO initiatives. It also performs functions required to operate ACOs and evaluates effectiveness of care coordination to improve quality of care to fee-for service Medicare beneficiaries, in accordance with the final rule and requests by CMS. In addition, it assists in data sharing, ACO eligibility verification, beneficiary assignment, calculating annual expenditures, calculating and applying performance and quality scores, calculating shared savings, and program reporting. CMS’ IT infrastructure is utilized in collaboration with outside contractors for design, development, quality assurance, maintenance, help desk support, evaluation, monitoring, education, and outreach. This encompasses IT developmental and project management activities associated with business intelligence development, database development, data dissemination, web portal application development and data analytics to support ACOs current and future program needs. This investment is dependent on shared services data environments within the CMS framework including, Integrated Data Repository, National Claims History, Master Data Management, Baltimore Data Center Hosting, and any Business Intelligence Software applicable.","009SO18205 - Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition","Response:  The investment supports key infrastructure that is used to track, monitor and support Medicare’s ACO portfolio which includes the national Medicare Shared Savings Program with over 560 ACOs serving over 10.5 million Medicare FFS beneficiaries and ACO models developed and tested by the Center for Medicare Medicaid Innovation which include 88 ACOs across four models serving 10 million beneficiaries.  The infrastructure investment plays a critical role in resolving and avoiding provider and beneficiary overlap in participating in multiple Medicare shared savings and avoiding duplicate payments for the same/similar services.  An OIG review of the Medicare Shared Savings Program found that no overlap existed which underscores the critical role the system plays in supporting Medicare’s ACO portfolio.    CMS complied with Federal requirements when assigning beneficiaries to ACOs in the MSSP during PYs 2013 through 2015 by ensuring that MSSP beneficiaries were assigned to only one ACO and were not assigned to other savings programs. The infrastructure also supports the production and delivery of monthly Part A, B and D Medicare claims line feeds to over 559 ACOs who receive monthly data feeds on 20,449,413 million Medicare FFS beneficiaries.  These data feeds help promote program transparency and provide critical information to ACOs and their providers that guides their care coordination and quality improvement activities.  CMS loads additional provider or assigned beneficiary data for Shared Savings Program ACOs in the MDM, to include adding, correcting or deleting records as needed. This reporting is specific to loading  the Track 1 and Track 2 assignable beneficiaries. These data help CMS detect and prevent unpermitted overlaps between providers' participation in multiple Medicare shared savings initiatives, and prevent assignment of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries across multiple value-based purchasing payment initiatives where this is impermissible under the design of the model or the related statutory  regulatory authority.","Section 3022 of the Affordable Care Act legislatively mandated the establishment of the Accountable Care Organization Medicare Shared Savings Program.  Since passage of the Affordable Care Act, more than 550 Medicare ACOs have been established, serving more than 12 million Medicare beneficiaries. To date, ACO performance results have demonstrated significant improvements in the quality of care ACOs are offering to Medicare beneficiaries and significant savings generated for Medicare. Results also show that ACOs with more experience in the program tend to perform better over time. Interest in CMS’ Medicare ACO initiatives continues to be strong—with new applicants seeking to join the national program, existing ACOs seeking to continue in the national program for a second agreement, and new applicants seeking to join ACO models being tested by the Innovation Center.  This investment also aligns with the Agency's Strategic Plan:  Strategic Goal 1: Better Care and Lower Costs; Objective 1:  Improve Quality of Care.

IFT supports the United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Strategic Goals articulated in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) Report published by DHS in June 2014. The IFT program supports Mission 2 of the QHSR: ""Secure and Manage our Borders"". More specifically, the IFT Program addresses Goal 2.1: ""Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches."" The IFT Investment assists in the prevention of illegal entry of people, weapons, and contraband while at the same time not negatively impacting the safe and lawful flow of commerce and travel. 
 
Benefits include mission efficiency and effectiveness, as well as Border Patrol safety. More specifically, the IFT system provides the Border Patrol the capability of continuously detecting Items of Interest (IoIs) from a tested range of 6.2 miles and identifying/classifying each from a tested range of 6.8 miles from each fixed tower within a Border Patrol Station’s Area of Coverage (AoC). The system provides the Common Operating Picture (COP) operator(s) at the Border Patrol Station Command and Control Center with near real-time video of operator-selected IoIs of sufficient quality to enable a trained operator to identify and classify the IoI. IoI data from one or more IFT units across the AoC will be shown geospatially on one or more COP workstations that also display the video of operator-selected IoIs. This will allow the COP operator to track and communicate the location and number of IoIs to Border Patrol Agents in the field, thus allowing the USBP to monitor an Area of Interest (AoI) with fewer agents and equipment resources.

Goal: Provide upgraded camera suites with additional surveillance tools, replace the current analog system with a digital system necessary for Certification & Accreditation, and provide modern command and control (C2) facilities to incorporate additional situational awareness capabilities.
Current and Anticipated Benefits: To increase persistence surveillance capabilities through a more secure digital system, improved video quality for C2 operations, and improved detection and situational awareness along wider land border areas.
Mission Delivery Contribution: The RVSS Upgrade Program supports the DHS Strategic Goal 2.1: “Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders” and CBP Strategic Goal 2: “Advance Comprehensive Border Security and Management.” This includes preventing the illegal entry of people, weapons, dangerous goods, and contraband, and protecting against cross-border threats to health, food, environment, and agriculture, while facilitating the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce, as well as preventing the illegal export of weapons, proceeds of crime, and other dangerous goods. The program will enhance the mission through early detection of border incursions, enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and the ability to track items of interest through a law enforcement resolution. The program will enhance agent and public safety through persistent surveillance in high enforcement areas.
Stakeholders: Internal Stakeholders include Office of Acquisition (OA), Office of Information and Technology (OIT), Office of Border Patrol (OBP), Office of Finance (OF).  External stakeholders include US Department of Interior (DOI); National Park Services (NPS); US Fish and Wild Services (USFWS); US Department of Agriculture (USDA)/US Forest Service; private and public landowners and various other regulatory agencies.
Customers and Other Beneficiaries: CBP US Border Patrol Agents, Intelligence Research Specialists, Sector Enforcement Specialists, Supervisors and Joint Field Command and the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison (OIIL). External Customers and beneficiaries include State and Local law enforcement; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); and the general public.","024APG18014 - Enhance Southern Border Security","The calculated Return on Investment (ROI) is 669%. Compared to the baseline operating costs of $3,634M with the new operating cost of $562M from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the RVSS operating costs are estimated to be considerably lower. ROI calculation: [(Baseline Operating Costs {with agents only} minus RVSS Upgrade Operating Costs) divided by the Capital Investment Cost], minus 1 providing the same level of surveillance. 
The key internal benefit is that for a lower overall operating cost, the investment will provide the USBP with a persistent surveillance capability, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track Items of Interests (IoIs), thus enabling them to monitor an Area of Interest more efficiently and effectively. Other benefits include: facilitate mission accomplishments; allow agents to be re-aligned since it acts as a force multiplier; agents will be safer since fewer will be required in the field for surveillance; technology will be used only in areas in which it performs well; and improved data will be available (recorded video imagery) for successful law enforcement accomplishment versus the baseline. 
Additional benefits include maintaining low logistics support costs, a minimal number of trouble tickets, a high operational availability, a low number of priority 1 downtime events, and a low number of priority 2 and 3 corrective actions.  
External Benefits: The program could result in indirect and long-term beneficial impacts by reducing the adverse impacts of illegal cross-border violator activities in the project area.  The RVSS towers would enhance CBP’s detection and threat classification capabilities and increase the efficiency of operational activities within the area of tower coverage.  Over time the enhancement of detection capabilities and an increase in operational efficiency could increase the deterrence of illegal cross-border violator activity within the area of tower coverage. 
Planned Outcomes: The intended mission outcomes are three-fold (1) Increase situational awareness provided on the Southwest Border while leveraging the added range potential of cameras systems where practical. (2) Replace the current analog system with a more secure digital system. (3) The RVSS Upgrade is expected to enhance the current mission through early detection of border incursions, through enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and through an improved ability to track items of interest.","Outstanding Audit Finding or Material Weakness: GAO reported in March 2014 and April 2015 that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), had made progress in deploying programs under the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan (the Plan), but could take additional actions to strengthen its management of the Plan and its related programs. Specifically, in March 2014 GAO reported that CBP's schedules and life-cycle cost estimates for the Plan and its three highest-cost programs—which represented 97 percent of the Plan's total estimated cost—met some but not all best practices. GAO recommended that CBP ensure that its schedules and cost estimates more fully address best practices, such as validating cost estimates with independent estimates, and DHS concurred.

The program has been working to update the documentation with some being completed. CAD approved unconstrained estimate in late 2017 but required an affordability analysis to compare Program of Record to current funding. Affordability analysis provided eliminated PCI shortfalls by reducing funding for sectors but significant shortfalls now exist in OS across the FYHSP due to the new requirement to support Legacy RVSS systems within the current funding, which was not increased in the FY18 Enacted budget. 
In addition, program carried over less than anticipated between PCI and OS, meaning they are spending more than planned.

Customers and Beneficiaries include: Soldiers (Active, National Guard and Reserve) and Army Civilians.  Key stakeholders: The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) and U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command.  Benefits include increased training effectiveness and efficiency, improved readiness and increased training access for customers.

All of DLS capabilities are in full sustainment with investment dollars used to complete technology refreshment.  DLS is in full sustainment of: 190 Digital Training Facilities (DTF) capable of delivering multimedia courseware, so that students can perform self-paced training or participate in group training events at fixed facilities;  An Enterprise Management Center that provides enterprise level network-based DTFs, courseware and system management of the DLS information resources; An Army Learning Management System (ALMS) that is a web-based information system for centralizing, standardizing and optimizing training, training management and training delivery functions under a single system containing all the necessary TMA capabilities and ingredients for mission success and Army e-Learning which is a web-based commercial information technology training product for use by Soldiers and civilians to acquire and sustain business and information technology.

DLS is fielding 20 Deployed Digital Training Campus (DDTC) systems.  DDTCs are mobile classrooms delivering multimedia courseware, so students can perform self-paced instruction or participate in group training events in a deployed or remote location.

The projected DLS savings identified were considered to favorably impact training costs by reducing or eliminating some travel and significantly reducing learner per diem and Army institutional school training support (base operations) costs. Other cost avoidances that were identified would: 1) improve training efficiency by providing greater access to training materials and enabling the Army to train more learners in a shorter period of time; 2) reduce manual operations and improve accuracy by automating record-keeping and management functions; 3) eliminate investments in multiple, non-compatible local systems and 4) facilitate reuse and maintenance of digital training content. In FY17, the Army Learning Management System (ALMS) provided approximately 9.3M training hours to Soldiers, resulting in a training cost avoidance of $94M. Background on calculations: the costs associated with ALMS training are approximately $14M; the 9.3Mtraining hours are equivalent to 1,521,000 Soldiers, which would equate to approximately $108M in TDY costs; TDY costs ($108M) minus ALMS costs ($14M) equals $94M..","In April 1991, the Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) Major Automated Information Systems Review Council (MAISRC), now the Information Technology Overarching Integrated Project Team (IT OIPT), approved a Mission Need Statement (MNS) for a distributed learning capability. As part of The Army Distributed Learning Program (TADLP), the Army is required to provide Soldiers initial military training (IMT), advanced individual training (AIT), functional courses, professional military education (PME) and specialized training at their home stations and in unique theaters of operation. This need is expected to increase as large forces decrease in major theaters and deploy in smaller, more numerous worldwide operations. Since October 1997 (FY98) DLS has developed and provided distributed learning (DL) infrastructure capability to Soldiers at home stations via Digital Training Facilities (DTF) and since 2010 in-theater with the transportable Deployed Digital Training Campus (DDTC). Since 2004 DLS has used Army Learning Management System (ALMS) to deliver through these facilities, and home, office, and field computers via the NIPRNET and Internet the next generation of DL courseware and kept records of student progress.

Commercially available software and hardware supporting DL courseware change frequently. These changes required four-year technical refresh cycles for DTF workstations and software and seven years for servers. Nearly ninety percent of ALMS users use home and office computers for DL courseware, which required the ALMS to perform four major software upgrades in the last ten years. During FY17 DLS provided online training delivery to 1,799,958 DTF users, 11,865,036 ALMS users and over 138,213 Soldiers in-theater.

To gain operational efficiencies and lower server maintenance costs, DCPDS standardized its server architecture in 2014 to the Hewlett Packard Blade architecture across all application and database tiers and has completed the consolidation of the Military Agencies into DCPDS datacenter in September 2014, eliminating Component-hosted DCPDS operations. The future focus areas for of DCPDS include consolidating disparate databases into one; establishing a single employee record for each member; exploiting efficiencies gained through the use of the systems’ additional COTS offerings and complying with the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) by relocating hosting activities to a certified commercial cloud and evolving this investment into the Defense Civilian Human Resources Management (DCHRM) program..","007SO18267 - Lay the foundation for future readiness through recapitalization, innovation, and modernization","DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian Human Resources (HR) automated system, supporting approximately 900,000 users worldwide. DCPDS architecture is standard for all enterprise operations and all Military Departments and Defense Agency platforms. DoD has been designated as one of six (6) shared service centers by OMB/OPM. DCPDS has proven its business case and provides cost avoidance for the Department over $200M per year by operating centrally those HR system activities previously operated by the individual Components.  Additional improvements to MyBiz+ will increase the amount of self-service capability for employees as well as supervisors/managers.  Consolidation of databases and employee records will increase overall workload efficiency.  It is estimated that the potential annual savings on database management and application sustainment costs will be realized beginning in FY2019 at approximately $1.5M.  These dollars represent a savings to the government and to the taxpayer. DCPDS also serves as a model for systems external to the government in its ability to support a large, complex automated data system with strict IA and cybersecurity compliance across all of the DCPDS enterprise systems and enclaves.In addition to changes implemented within DCPDS, the Defense Civilian Human Resources Management (DCHRM) program that DCPDS will be transitioning to, boasts an approximate $66M savings from 2018 - 2013 by moving to a Software as a Service model; acquiring all the system/software/network and operations support from the SaaS vendor and eliminating the need for brick and mortar data center support..","In 1991, based on a series of functional and system studies and business process reengineering (BPR) analyses, the Department began reengineering civilian HR processes.  During that time, the Department reviewed a variety of automated systems to support reengineered processes and the Department's information needs.  In 1994, Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E), in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), conducted a study and recommended that the Department further examine the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products to support a civilian HR data system for DoD.  The PA&E study concluded that savings could be generated by modernizing civilian personnel systems to support a regionalized HR operational environment, and that the most cost effective course of action was to develop a single DoD-wide civilian personnel data system.  
The development of DCPDS was initiated in December 1994 under the Regionalization and Systems Modernization Program.  The program was established to address the rising cost of civilian HR operations in the Department, which included ten disparate legacy automated personnel systems.  The program addressed this by transforming and streamlining personnel operations through consolidation and regionalization, with reengineered HR business processes using a single, standard automated personnel system to support civilian HR operations.  System acquisition and development through Milestone III approval (March 2002) was carried out under the DoD Major Automated Information System Review Council (MAISRC) process.
The latest effort to migrate the Core HR capability that currently resides within DCPDS into the Oracle HCM SaaS offering, was approved by the Reform Management Group, led by the DEFSECDEF, on 23 May 2018.

FATCA introduces new reporting requirements for U.S. taxpayers and Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs). The legislation requires U.S. taxpayers holding foreign financial assets, with aggregate values exceeding certain thresholds, to annually report information to the IRS; and for FFIs with U.S. taxpayer accounts to register, report annually to the IRS, and withhold / pay 30 percent of selected U.S. source income to the IRS. These complementary provisions create a web of international tax accountability, allowing the IRS to gather and analyze information from multiple sources, bolstering the compliance of U.S. taxpayers with assets overseas. 

Treasury has worked with foreign governments to negotiate Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) that address specific legal impediments surrounding privacy laws and the disclosure of accountholder information. In addition to foreign account and asset data submitted by taxpayers and entities, the IRS will assemble and transmit Bank Deposit and Interest (BDI) data on accounts held by foreign nationals from U.S. financial institutions (FIs) to foreign government Host Country Tax Authorities (HCTAs), under agreements intended to facilitate FATCA adoption.

The Primarily COTS alternative scored the highest due to its lower cost and overall lower risk profile. In FY15 CA/CST acquired the core Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution, continuing in FY16 with procuring foundational IT infrastructure hardware and software, and in FY17 beginning ConsularOne infrastructure modernization. For FY18 and beyond the ConsularOne team focused an Analysis of Alternatives on one of the ten ConsularOne outcomes - the Person-Centricity concept that enables what is colloquially referred to as a “360-degree” customer view. The purpose of the analysis was to identify the best alternative that will help ConsularOne achieve the Person-Centricity outcome. Per DoS/SPO requirements, a cloud option was considered, but eliminated during the final down-selection phase based on DoS Directive 5 FAH-8 H-354.1: Information Prohibited for Use in A Cloud Computing Product or Service; Consular Data: Data gathered for processing requests for visa or passports. Of the four alternatives, the Complete Custom Rebuild (CCR) alternative has the highest values for both the Financial and Objective Metrics.  The CCR alternative would be custom developed to specifically and completely meet the Consular Affairs’ requirements and capitalize on the business-specific data constraints within the source systems.  The three major components [Entity Resolution Engine, the Entity Resolution Database, and the Search Engine] would be custom developed or use open-source frameworks and configured based on the specific requirements of the three main business areas:  Passport, Visa, and Overseas Citizen Services (OCS). The benefits fall under the productivity gain category and total to $666M in constant dollars over a ten-year period.

As of 02/28/2019, ITS.gov has a total SV% of 0.0% and a CV% of +7.18% (under budget). ITS OMV variance is 5.00%.
Primary variance driver relates to ITS having multiple positions budgeted (3.5 FTEs) which are currently unfilled. This will drive positive cost variance this Fiscal Year until the positions are filled. Two of these positions are filled by staff deployed on military duty, and the other 1.5 FTE related to currently unfilled positions the Investment is working to fill.

Master Index that provides a universal entity identifier and contains definitions of identifiable attributes that define a master data type.  
Profiles and relationships that provide the relationship between an entity and an organization and provides the profiles of the entity. 
Data services that provide business applications access to integrated MDM profile data and relationships.
Business intelligence service that provides a separate mechanism to support analytical applications and report generation.
The primary goals of MDM are:
·         Resolve identity ambiguity inherent in CMS Beneficiary and Provider data through an identity resolution service
·         Better manage, organize and store all CMS Beneficiary, Provider, Organization, and Program profile data components
·         Identify and manage relationships between Beneficiaries, Providers, Organizations and CMS Programs 
·         Improve data quality of Beneficiary, Provider, Organization, and Program information 
·         Reduce cost and complexity of CMS systems

The Geospatial Platform is a government-wide shared service that delivers trusted, nationally consistent data and services; authoritative data to support informed decision-making; problem solving applications (services) that are built once and used many times across multiple Federal agencies and other organizations; and a national and federal focal point where governmental, non-governmental, private and public data and applications can be used together to inform and address national and regional issues.

Federal, state, and local government agencies collect, maintain, and use geospatial data linked to specific geographic locations in support of many functions including national security, law enforcement, health care, environmental sustainability, and emergency preparedness and response. These data are purchased or collected and maintained by many agencies independently, and their use by multiple agencies and organizations requires coordination, interoperability, and shared services and applications. The Geospatial Platform investment will provide a mechanism for the sharing of geospatial assets to reduce redundancy; ensure implementation of standards to promote integration and interoperability; establish/document oversight measures to ensure accountability; and facilitate a portfolio management approach to Federal management of National Geospatial Data Assets, fulfilling the requirements and intention of OMB Circular A-16 Supplemental Guidance.

Beneficiaries of this investment include agencies in all levels of government, which experience cost savings and avoidance; non-governmental organizations and the private sector as users of geospatial data, who find data from trusted sources, as well as compatible services, to be more readily available from a single source; and the American public, which will benefit from greater efficiency and accountability in the expenditure of tax dollars.","010SO18229 - Utilize science in land, water, species and habitat management supporting decisions and activities","One stop shop to deliver trusted, authoritative, and nationally consistent data and services;

 	Authoritative data to support informed decision making;

 	Problem-solving applications (Services) that are built once and used many times by Federal agencies and other organizations;

Return on Investment is enabled by a shared cloud computing infrastructure to host data and applications. Specifically, the increased sharing and reuse of resources facilitated by the Geoplatform reduces costs and results in savings and improved decision-making. As an example, the Geoplatform would maintain authoritative metadata as well as the services to enable use of the dataset in a viewer. This eliminates the need for agencies to duplicate this effort on an individual basis.  Another example, the Geoplatform allows for data to be presented through a map (e.g., road data set or a building data set) put the data into the Geoplatform map and create a map that can be analyzed, store the map and use it at another time--- whereas in an agency database you can create a map, add layers but when you close the application you lose the layers. So the ability of the Geoplatform is to aggregate info in one place and save the presentation layer as an object and the ability to return to it to add layers, save the new layers as an object, and reutilize both presentations as often as required. The Geoplatform is saving the presentation of data as an object. The cost saving is ability to reutilize persistent objects over time.. 

Cost savings/avoidance is also achieved through the Communities component of the platform which is essentially an open platform for individual NGDA s to build out a website where they provide links to documents, geospatial map galleries, calendars of events, etc.  The Geoplatform provides the infrastructure, the tools and space for agencies to build their communities and allow stakeholders to exchange information.  Federal Agencies avoid the cost of hosting individual communities  infrastructures within their Agency. 

Federal Agencies are required to access the geoplatform s marketplace component before they expend funds to collect or produce new geospatial data in order to determine if the information has already been collected by others or whether cooperative efforts to obtain the data are possible.  This component of the platform enables cost savings and efficiencies by coordinating acquisition opportunities and avoiding duplicative procurements of data.","Agency Strategic Plan/Annual Performance Plan.

The TAMR program employs a three-phased approach to modernizing the air traffic control systems that controllers use at or near the nation's major airports. The first phase of the program, TAMR Phase 1 – replaced the automated radar processing and display systems at Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities and their associated airport traffic control towers. Phase 1 deployed STARS to 47 sites. TAMR Phase 2 - involved the replacement of automation systems at five additional TRACONs and the modernization of air traffic controller displays and system processors at four large TRACONs, including Denver and Chicago. The final phase of the program, TAMR Phase 3 - is addressing the remaining 108 sites. These sites presently operate with the Common Automated Radar Terminal System (CARTS) platform, and many are nearing the end of their intended service lives. On April 21, 2010, the Joint Resource Council (JRC) approved the division of TAMR Phase 3 into two segments. TAMR Phase 3, Segment 1 received JRC approval in December 2011 to replace the Automated Radar Terminal (ARTS) IIIE systems by 2017.  To date, Phase 3 Segment 1 (Phase 3) has achieved deployment at the 11 busiest TRACONS in the country. TAMR Phase 3, Segment 2 (Phase 4) received JRC approval for Final Investment Decision (FID) in September 2012 to replace the remaining ARTS IIE and IE systems deploying from 2013 to 2019. By using an existing stable automation platform and adding new digital interfaces, ADS-B capability, and state of the art displays and processors, terminal automation convergence will be achieved and will reduce future investment, training, support, and maintenance costs.

Qualitative benefits (cost avoidance) are expected such as avoiding costs to maintain aging equipment, lifecycle benefits of common displays and processors, and common hardware for re-use and expansions will facilitate convergence to a single automation platform, thus avoiding NextGen functionalities on two separate platforms. Qualitative benefits are expected to enhance controller’s situational awareness, and discerning weather and lessening risk through efficiency and commonality. TAMR Phase 2 conducted an alternatives analysis to compare the replacement/modernization of automation systems at nine TRACONs compared to other alternatives. Net Present Value (NPV) with costs and quantitative benefits were used in the analysis. The selected alternative had an ROI of 2.1.

G-REX is a completely modularized and de-coupled SOA-enabled system where the user-interface (human processes), business processes, middle-tier and database-tier operate and function independently while remaining in synch with each other.

GREX capitalizes on existing PBS IT assets with the integration of information systems, primarily the REXUS inventory and billing application, for seamless data exchange, reduction in data entry, and consistency of data.

G-REX is accessible from the PBS Portal, an Oracle AS 11g-based enterprise portal solution. The PBS Portal provides a security framework, including its features for single-sign-on (SSO), user authentication, role management, and user recertification for applications.  Through the PBS extranet, G-REX is available outside the GSA network for external users.

The lease user community consists of a variety of business roles, each of which has different data access privileges.  The main users are the Leasing Specialists, who manage the lease throughout its lifecycle.  The National Broker Contractors access the application for completing assigned tasks.  Regional management, including Regional Contract Officers and Regional Program Managers, access project and summary level information and reports.  Property Managers access lease's source documentation.  External agency users access the Del-e-Gate module for submission and tracking of requested lease delegations.","023SO18143 - Establish GSA as a more effective provider of real estate services for all agencies.","The technology platform used to build the G-REX application affords the Government, internal to PBS, within GSA, and within other Government agencies, many opportunities for functionality re-use with expected development costs to be at lower amounts.","Published Agency Strategic Plan/Annual Performance Plan - GREX supports the GSA Strategic goals.",no,no,yes,,,"Justin Pinkey","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",28.692697,1.859146,3.345282,3.345676,2012,2027,"There have been no significant changes from PY to CY.","1 - continue as is",3,"The performance of this major IT investment is monitored as part of the Agency's monthly investment control review.

IRIS was comprised of systems, applications, and business processes, all in constant communication to effectively support the Mint's sales function for numismatists and the general public. While the retail sales system was state-of-the-art at the time of implementation in 2001, United States Mint failed to implement vendor-provided upgrades to the application software, resulting in an environment that failed to meet United States Mint business needs and presented unacceptable risks. Specifically, the operating system and application software could not be supported through standard service contracts as is was unsupported by their vendors. Additionally, the hardware was no longer manufactured and could not be replaced with new equipment in the event of failure. Some general facts about the Mint numismatic business:
- 438,231 unique purchasers, with numismatic revenue of $289.3 million and 3.3 million units sold in FY 2018.
- 458,935 unique purchasers, with numismatic revenue of $380.5 million and 3.9 million units sold in FY 2017.
- 498,862 unique purchasers, with numismatic revenue of $400.5 million and 4.2 million units sold in FY 2016.
- 546,114 unique purchasers, with numismatic revenue of $453.2 million and 5.4 million units sold in FY 2015.
- 550,659 unique purchasers, with numismatic revenue of $504.5 million and 5.7 million units sold in FY 2014.

It was imperative that the Mint replace the IRIS environment so it can conduct its business in a productive, reliable and secure manner. The primary purpose of this initiative was to replace the outdated systems and eliminate the risk of IRIS environment failure. The objective was to replace the systems supporting the numismatic business process and to provide United States Mint customers with an experience that keeps pace with advancements in both technology and business functionality in the retail industry. The OMS II specifically addressed Strategic Goal 3: Responsibly expand the numismatic program.

The scope includes:
- Replacing the IRIS environment with state-of-the-art capability. This includes replacement of the OMS e-Commerce Web platform, infrastructure, Warehouse Management System, and Contact Center Operations.
- Integrating the new solution with Mint internal and external systems that provide financial and inventory control and payment processing functions.","015SO18106 - Trusted Currency and Services: Deliver trusted currency and services that enable citizens and businesses to participate in the economy","- In addition to the enhanced capabilities that the new system will provide, there are also non-financial benefits including improved business processes and the utilization of cloud computing.

 The goal of PIVOT is to process flood insurance policies and claims for 5.3 million property owners, to reduce the impact of flooding on private and public structures, and to drive community recovery after disasters. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) supports establishment of operating policies, designation of eligible communities, creation of auditing specifications, experience determination, rate setting, responsibility for the management, operation, maintenance and quality assurance of the systems and data, marketing, training provision, analysis and reporting to Congress, and provision of financial information to all applicable departments and agencies.  
  
 The NFIP is a congressionally mandated program. PIVOT will supports the following DHS and FEMA missions and strategic goals: DHS Mission 5 (Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience), Strategic Goal 1 (Build a Culture of Preparedness), Objective 1.1 (Incentive investments that reduce risk) and Objective 1.2 (Close the Insurance Gap), and FEMA Strategic Goal 2 (Ready the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters). The key benefit of this investment is the continued operation of the NFIP and implementation of legislative reforms from Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.   
  
 The NFIP has a stakeholder community consisting of actors within and external to government, due to its unique operating model. NFIP resides within the Federal Insurance & Mitigation Association (FIMA) and interacts with other FEMA risk analysis and risk reduction initiatives. NFIP governs industry program administrators such as the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA), Write Your Own insurance companies (WYOs), FloodInsurance Processing Services Providers to WYOs (Vendors), and adjusters. The customers and beneficiaries are US citizens that are supported by flood insurance policies.

The Hybrid Approach was chosen in the AoA and is expected to deliver the largest benefits because it has the highest overall score by a large margin, demonstrating low cost while simultaneously meeting most of the NFIP’s business needs and minimizing risks. Because the COTS solutions within the Hybrid Approach are “best of breed” solutions, they also tend to have larger federal implementations and are compliant with most applicable federal security standards.  Most importantly, Hybrid Approach has a high level of strategic alignment with both the benefits and desired outcomes by this program.","URLs could not be formatted in this box (please see DHS supporting comments for URLs).

The data collections and data tools this investment supports provide the basis for information that would be otherwise unavailable to the general public. ED and its federal partners use these data to inform a wide range of programmatic, regulatory and legislative activities, including those that support/fund early childhood programs, middle grades transition, high school completion and access to postsecondary education, and postsecondary financing. Data are also used by independent researchers (e.g., nonprofit agencies, research faculty) to generate new scholarship that will drive innovation and improvement at the national, state, and local levels. This investment s key deliverables support the development of the instruments and tools that allow for the efficient, effective collection, processing and dissemination of sample survey data.

The PowerStats data tool allows public site users to produce complex tables and regressions using sample survey datasets, including pre-elementary education, schools and staffing, longitudinal studies and postsecondary education. The Distance Learning Dataset Training (DLDT) project's objectives are to convert NCES in-person database training materials into computer-based training (CBT) modules, including modules containing introductory and common information about NCES data in addition to sets of survey/dataset-specific modules with detailed information needed to understand, access, and appropriately use NCES's complex sample and universe micro-datasets.","018SO18041 - Support agencies and institutions in the implementation of evidence-based strategies and practices that build the capacity of school staff and families to support students' academic performance.","Sample Surveys Collection Activities: 
The ECLS-K:2011 is NCES' only longitudinal study of students at the elementary school level studying issues in child development and education. The study began collecting data in fall 2010 and conducted its last round of data collection in spring 2016. As the study added on rounds of data collection, experience led to efficiencies in both data collection and data processing, leading to cost savings.

For HSLS, the primary IT development task for FY18 and FY19 involves the system for collecting postsecondary transcripts and student records from student sample members. Because the survey received about ~72% response from sample members in 2016, the student records and transcripts will fill in much-needed data for the remaining part of the sample that did not respond. This important data will meet NCES needs for reporting on college access and choice, as well as financial aid and student outcomes following the completion of high school. The development of a user-friendly system for transmitting this important data will make the task easier for personnel at higher education institutions, and will improve data quality as a result.

The MGLS:2017 covers an entirely new grade series for both the longitudinal K-12 surveys and sample surveys generally at NCES and thus requires extra planning and effort to launch. The study conducted two field tests in the past two years in preparation for the Main Study that runs from January-June 2018. The most salient use of technology in this study that has been developed through the field tests is the mobile testing kits that do not require a computer lab or depend on the schools  internet for connectivity. The resulting reduction in burden on schools will make it less costly to recruit and keep schools in the study.

The NHES:2016 web-based data collection using within-household sampling and one-stage administration needed only one incentive per household in most cases. The 2017 survey uses web instruments in NHES:2019 (FY2019), which could realize at least $100,000 in cost savings from incentives, likely more. Improvements to the NHES:2017 web instruments, planned for development in 2018, will allow for collection of more than one completed survey per household in NHES:2019 (FY2019), which could realize at least $200,000 in cost savings from starting with a smaller sample.","The NPSAS survey is required in the Higher Education Opportunity Act.  The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended in the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, 20 U.S.C. 1015, requires NCES to conduct a  student aid recipient survey  at least every 4-years.  NCES fulfills this requirement with the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study.  http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas. 

More generally, our surveys are mandated because IES is charged with collecting and disseminating data and information on the condition and progress of education; practices that support learning, achievement, and access; and the effectiveness of educational programs (Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (20 U.S. Code Section 9543). These surveys include the ECLS-K:2011, NHES, NTPS, PSS, SSOCS and DLDT. The ECLS-K:2011 is NCES' most recent longitudinal study of students at the elementary school level. While the study itself is not legislatively mandated, it collects and reports on data to help NCES fulfill its legislative mandate, through the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (20 U.S. Code Section 9543), to collect data on the social and economic status of children, including their academic achievement, and access to before- and after-school care. Additionally, the ECLS-K:2011 is an example of one of the NCES longitudinal data collections necessary to report on the condition and progress of education.  While ECLS-K:2011 data collection has concluded, study staff continues work to release the study s datasets and reports, making the ECLS-K:2011 is the only current, large-scale, nationally representative study of young children being conducted in the United States. As with past ECLS studies, data from the ECLS-K:2011 will be a valuable resource for researchers around the world to use for investigation of various issues in child development and education. The study began collecting data in fall 2010 and finished its last round of data collection in spring 2016. As the study adds on rounds of data collection being prepared for data release, experience has led to efficiencies in data processing, leading to cost savings.   http://ies.ed.gov/surveys

IPEDS is the primary source of data on colleges, universities, and technical and vocational postsecondary education. The Common Core of Data collects fiscal and non-fiscal data about all public schools, public school districts and state education agencies in the United States. Both IPEDS and CCD provide a sampling frame to many survey collections, including many conducted by NCES and the Department of ED.

They provide universe data used in policymaking and research and serve as the basis for many other data collections. 

IPEDS transitioned from paper data collection to web-based data collection in 2000 to reduce respondent burden and administrative costs while improving collection and dissemination processes. Online IPEDS data dissemination tools are regularly enhanced to increase public utility as IPEDS is the Department's primary source of institutional higher education data for students, parents, the Department of Education, Congress, researchers, colleges, associations, and various other stakeholder groups. IPEDS data populate the legislatively required College Navigator as well as the Department s College Scorecard and other tools within the College Affordability and Transparency Center. IPEDS is also the foundation on which institutional sampling frames are created for other postsecondary research studies conducted by NCES; those studies include the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS), and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B).

The EDGE program uses Census tabulation blocks to aggregate and provide estimates for school, districts, counties, states, and the Nation using American Community Survey data. The data are tabulated for different types of schools (elementary, middle and high school) and districts (elementary, secondary, and unified), various age categories of children, and households and families. All data developed for EDGE will be made available through the NCES web site. The project will display data through a geographic information system (GIS) that will allow data to be analyzed visually. The web application allows a school or a district to compare to one or more other school or districts; files for schools or school districts can be downloaded; thematic mapping of pre-selected tables/items will be available along with standard GIS functions.

The intended result is the successful completion of the projects and the dissemination of findings and related data.  International assessments include PISA, PIRLS, TIMSS, and PIAAC.","018SO18041 - Support agencies and institutions in the implementation of evidence-based strategies and practices that build the capacity of school staff and families to support students' academic performance.","As a result of ensuring NAEP is technologically advanced and efficient, U.S. schools will benefit from improved validity through use of objective information about student performance in selected learning areas made available to policymakers at the national, state and local levels. Other stakeholders of NAEP include parents, students, researchers, media and educators. The resulting data inform these stakeholders about the progress of academic achievement in the United States.

As computers and digital tools play an increasingly important role in the classroom, NAEP must explore new testing methods and item types that reflect this growing use of technology in education. NAEP s future lies in using technology to measure and report on the types of skills that are increasingly important in students  lives and are critical to success in a digital world. As such, NAEP must leverage technology to fully understand what students know and can do, including how they engage with technology to approach problem solving.  Through digitally based assessments (DBAs) NAEP has been able to introduce a variety of new item types that move beyond the traditional format of multiple-choice and constructed-response to better reflect the kinds of technology tools and interactions students are expecting to find in classrooms across the country. 

This investment may eventually realize some cost savings in printing and administrative costs associated with paper-based assessments. NAEP has nearly ceased printing paper publications and moved to digital dissemination of all data. However, by moving toward digitally-based assessments by 2017, the usage cost of technology will offset that savings.   Overall, we anticipate lower program costs and reduced burden on schools. NAEP and International assessments will glean finer-grain data (both observable how students take the assessment and what features they are using and performance) to support diagnostic research and analysis. For 2017, overall NAEP costs increased by about $19.6M due to the purchase cost of tablets and the addition of items previously classified as non-IT. For 2018, costs will be lower due to ongoing usage of the tablets mostly paid for in 2016 and 2017. DBA is critical to the success of the entire NAEP program for several reasons. As computers and digital tools play an increasingly important role in today's classrooms, NAEP must utilize the latest testing methods and item types that reflect the growing technology.","NCES  mission is to  collect, and analyze and disseminate statistics and other information related to education in the United States and in other nations  (stated in section 406 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1221e-1) and in the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (P.L. 279-107, Part C, Sec. 153):

While the current registration system continues to fulfill its mission of processing and reviewing applications for operating authority, the process is ripe for modernization and further efficiencies, particularly regarding vetting carriers that may be reincarnated or “chameleon” carriers. Previous FMCSA initiatives to improve the registration process, and to identify and act upon special types of unsafe carriers reincarnating, have been met with success. This contributes directly to the FMCSA goal of raising the bar to enter the motor carrier industry so that only carriers that are fit, willing and able can operate.
 
In addition to new key URS capabilities, as of the BY 2019 submission, the URS investment also includes the legacy registration system functionality being performed in Licensing and Insurance (L&I) and Operating Authority Management (OAM).  These include licensing and insurance system functionalities such as insurance verification and BOC-3 processing agent designation processes.  They also include back end access capabilities for authorized Federal and state users to retrieve license and insurance information as well as access information referencing the status of commercial motor carriers, hazardous material shippers, and companies with blanket designations.
 
In summary, the URS will streamline the existing registration process for FMCSA-regulated entities by incorporating the USDOT Number as the single identification number for registration. FMCSA internal authorities can more effectively track and monitor the operations of motor carriers, brokers, freight forwarders, intermodal equipment providers (IEP), hazardous materials safety permit applicants (HMSP), and cargo tank facilities (CTF) using registration and application indicators.","021APG18034 - Reduce Surface Transportation-Related Fatalities, 021SO18095 - Systemic Safety Approach, 021SO18098 - System Operations and Performance, 021SO18103 - Mission Efficiency and Support","In addition to URS's new ""turbo-tax"" like user-friendly interface, the system will replace multiple existing registration forms with one new electronic online application system.  The interactive wizard will automatically direct an applicant to the sections relevant to its type of operation. In addition to providing a more streamlined, cost efficient registration process, the use of an exclusive electronic filing process will improve data quality.  Additional benefits of URS include: 
Preventing carriers who are unwilling to comply with FMCSA regulations or are attempting to reincarnate as a new carrier to avoid FMCSA enforcement actions from registering with the Agency,
Increasing customer satisfaction of the motor carrier industry with the registration process, 
Streamlining the processing of registration applications and issuing of USDOT safety and commercial registration identification (USDOT Numbers and Operating Authority)
Decreasing the cycle time required for applicants to complete and submit applications and, 
Decreasing the number of customer service calls that are related to registration issues.

OMHA was created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 to simplify the appeals process and make it more efficient. OMHA’s current workload has increased dramatically over the last year and has significantly impacted its ability to effectively process the work.  OMHA’s claims received increased by 196% from 2006 to 2012.  This large increase in workload has resulted in a large backlog of appeals that has overwhelmed OMHA’s paper case file storage facilities and decreased the percent of appeals processed in the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) 90 day timeframe.  OMHA must take advantage of the efficiencies that electronic processing can bring.  To accomplish this, OMHA has initiated the Electronic Case Adjudication and Processing Environment (ECAPE) project.  
 
ECAPE will provide a stable, responsive, user-friendly system with functionality that fully supports the business processes and allows work in an electronic environment that enables sharing of data and documents between all four HHS Medicare appeal levels.  In addition to electronic case files, ECAPE will deliver the following functionality to improve customer service and operational efficiency:
-          Online appeal filing and document submission by appellants
-          Correspondence generation
-          Hearing Scheduling 
-          Automated case processing workflow and tracking
-          Decision writing assistance
-          Enhanced management information
ECAPE is a new system development project.  OMHA plans to purchase a configurable Case Management system to serve as the core of the ECAPE.  ECAPE will interface with the Medicare Appeals System (MAS) to retrieve Level 1 and 2 appeal data and documents and pass Level 3 (OMHA) data and documentsback to MAS for viewing by other appeal levels.   
Key Stakeholders: OMHA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of the Secretary, Departmental Appeals Board, District Court, and the Appellant Community.","009SO18208 - Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The ECAPE benefits will include a fully electronic environment:
·         Appeals filed on-line can be validated, eliminating delays caused by incorrect or incomplete information provided on the Request for Hearing.
·         Cost savings by eliminating paper cases files including printing, shipping and storage cost.
·         Fewer cases of lost privacy data.
·         Reduction of space footprint
·         Providers with electronic medical records will no longer be required to print and mail in records.
 This project supports the following OMHA and HHS goals:
·         Decrease the cost per appeal adjudicated.
·         Reduce the percentage of decisions reversed or remanded on appeals to the Medicare Appeals Council.

While NARA still maintains the nation's non-electronic permanent records, each year the volume of electronic records increases significantly. NARA faces the challenge of preserving these electronic records, across their many hundreds of formats, in such a way that they can still be made accessible by the public decades from now despite changes in technology.  NARA's Electronic Records Systems comprise a variety of IT tools that enable the accessioning, processing, description, preservation and ultimately presentation of these records to the American public. 

As part of the ERA 2.0 initiative, NARA is optimizing the ingest framework and process environment to facilitate the processing of permanent records into the Archives. From there, metadata such as descriptions and authorities will be added and then handed off to one of the electronic records repositories (such as Federal, Congressional, Presidential, or Classified) for preservation. Records are made available for access by the public via the National Archives Catalog (NAC). Several legacy tools are also still used to fill gaps in the workflow, though efforts are underway to address these gaps and retire these applications or incorporate updated versions into more streamlined workflows.","0 - Not Applicable","NARA's end-to-end approach for ingest, creation of metadata, storage, preservation, and presentation of electronic records will achieve many benefits for both NARA and the American public. A more robust and flexible, cloud-based infrastructure, optimized workflows and standardized metadata rules will help NARA reduce ingest and description backlogs and facilitate the steps necessary to make these records available to the public. Updated architecture and modular design will ensure greater scalability and reduce or stabilize costs. Use of cloud environments will provide a more robust platform, ensuring constant availability and on-demand scaling of processing and storage capacities.  Streamlined practices will also make our partnerships with businesses, such as Footnote and Ancestry.com, more fruitful and ensure consistency of data and metadata regardless of its final repository.

In FY16 and FY17, the Executive Office of President (EOP) 44 Transition project within the ERS investment successfully transferred over 250 terabytes/532,000,000 files, of electronic records under the Presidential Records Act from the Executive Office of the President into archival custody at NARA for custody, control, preservation, and access under that law.  

With ERA 2.0 going into Production in late 2018, NARA will have the extensible platform that will be required to evolve and scale to meet the challenge of managing greater volumes and varieties of digital materials from Federal Agencies and in-house digitization projects.

The Act requires for the EPA to establish a national e-Manifest system and to obtain authorization and appropriation from Congress for initial funding to develop the e-Manifest system.  The Act authorizes EPA to collect reasonable user fees for all system related costs once the system is deployed and in use.  EPA is only authorized to spend user fees for e-Manifest given appropriation requirements and guidelines.  

In response to this requirement, OLEM plans for e-Manifest to be a national electronic (internet-based) option that will enable facilities to initiate, sign, transmit, archive, and retrieve manifests electronically, thereby almost eliminating the paper process.  OLEM also plans for e-Manifest to provide a national repository of manifest data for access by EPA, states, industry and the public.  E-Manifest may utilize hazardous waste handler data from the RCRA Info system.  

EPA estimates the e-Manifest system will provide a significant reduction in the paper work burden labor cost to industry and state governments.  According to a 2009 study, EPA believes that the implementation of e-Manifest could result in annual cost savings exceeding $75 million, and annual burden reductions of between 370,000 and 700,000 burden hours.   

The implementation of e-Manifest would also produce significant non-economic benefits for all stakeholders, including:

-More timely waste shipment tracking services and higher quality data
-Transparency and rapid notification of problems or discrepancies during transit
-Enhanced inspection/enforcement capabilities for regulators
-One stop reporting of manifest data for the EPA and states
-Possible consolidation with Biennial Reporting 
-Improved information sharing with emergency responders.

The EPA estimates the national e-Manifest system will ultimately reduce the burden associated with preparing shipping manifests by between 300,000 and 700,000 hours.  The non-economic benefits of e-Manifest are also significant, including accountability due to enhanced tracking capabilities, which result in improved data quality from the manifest creation and editing aids that will be available in an electronic system along with improved inspection and oversight efficiencies for regulators who access manifests with electronic search aids;  and greater  data transparancy for communities as it relates to waste shipments and management trends.","Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act   enacted October 2012 directs EPA to establish (and own) a national hazardous waste electronic manifest tracking system.

The legislation required that federal contract, grant, loan, and other financial assistance awards be displayed on a publicly accessible and searchable website to give the American public access to information on how their tax dollars are being spent.

Through the USAspending website and supporting services, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service delivers on Treasury’s strategic goal to increase access to and use of federal financial data in order to strengthen government-wide decision-making and accountability through data transparency. This work seeks to provide the public and federal agencies with access to a greater range of financial data. The implementation of the DATA Act requirements is nearly completed, but the work of federal spending transparency and accountability continues. The Office of Data Transparency at Fiscal Service continuously improves data quality and usability and looks for ways to draw value and insights from federal spending data.

The Financial Information Repository (FIR) was added to the Data Services portfolio this year.  To support the Federal Financial Management vision, the FIR provides timely, reliable, secure, and consumable data to authorized federal users and the public.  The web-based application promotes transparency, increases accountability, facilitates better decision making, and improves operational efficiency.  The FIR provides an single touch-point to centrally manage, analyze, and report on the financial data that the U.S. Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) collects/receives. The FIR provides integrated financial management information across all Fiscal Service services and a robust Business Intelligence website that allows authorized users to analyze financial data trends, patterns, and other Business Intelligence concepts for improved decision making. The centralized data is made available to Federal Program Agencies, OMB, Congress and public citizens.  FIR employs financial management data standards to improve accessibility of financial management data for decision making and transparency reporting.","015SO18115 - Financial Data Access and Use: Increase the access and use of federal financial data to strengthen government-wide decision-making, transparency, and accountability., 015SO18116 - Debt Management: Fund the federal government at the least cost over time., 015SO18117 - Federal Financial Performance: Improve federal financial management performance using innovative practices to support effective government., 015SO18120 - Customer Value: Improve customer value by increasing the quality and lowering the cost of Treasury's products and services.","The USAspending.gov website and investment were mandated by OMB to be part of the Fiscal Service investment portfolio.

This investment/service includes the following components:

Emergency Response Data System (ERDS) is a mission-critical data collection system used by licensees to transmit reactor data points to the Headquarters Operations Center (HOC) for independent safety analysis.  ERDS directly supports the NRC's primary mission, as the system is integral to the agency s Incident Response Program for situational awareness and the assessment of licensee actions.

Operations Center Incident Management System (OCIMS) is a collection of mission-critical systems that provide the communication, information collection, display, and data sharing platforms for the NRC's Incident Response Program, and is the backbone for the HOC. OCIMS supports the NRC's primary mission-essential functions, because the HOC would become inoperable without this system.  Note that the Automated Notification System (ANS) and Headquarters Operations Officer (HOO) Database are modules under OCIMS.

Protected Web Server (PWS) is a mission-critical system that provides the ability to electronically exchange time-sensitive security-related information with licensees, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other agencies, including cyber security threat information.  This system satisfies the NRC s Federal Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) requirements. 

Region 1 Incident Response Center (R1-IRC), Region 2 Incident Response Center (R2-IRC), and Region 3 Incident Response Center (R3-IRC) provide real-time updates through a common video display, and incorporates audio and video with incident response. The Regional Response Centers also have data sharing capabilities to support the exchange of information with licensees and other Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies to facilitate the NRC s response to a nuclear incident or other emergency.

Benefits: The Incident Response investment provides an integrated set of automated tools to support the NRC's mission of ensuring adequate protection of public health and safety, to promote the common defense and security, and to protect the environment and effective operation of the NRC's emergency preparedness and incident response programs.","0 - Not Applicable","The OCIMS and ERDS systems play an important role in fulfilling the NRC strategic goals of safety (ensure adequate protection of public health and safety and the environment) and security (ensure adequate protection in the secure use and management of radioactive materials). In support of the agency's safety implementation strategies to conduct safety and security programs and emergency preparedness in an integrated manner and to respond to events at NRC-licensed facilities and other events of national and international interest, including maintaining and enhancing the NRC's emergency incident response and communication capabilities, these systems are used to maintain the readiness and capabilities of the NRC Headquarters Operations Center and regional response centers, which coordinate and monitor the agency's response to incidents and reportable conditions and licensees' actions to ensure safety at their facilities.
The OCIMS contract is an IDIQ issued to a small business, it provides the ability to issue task orders on an as needed basis, this eliminates the cost and time overhead in the issuance of a new contract every time. The contract requires the vendor to provide at least three options in the case of subcontracting these options are based on quality as well as cost. The contract requires the vendor to meet the time specified in the case an outage, this ensures that the NRC's strategic goals are met. As the contract is issued to a small business it meets the requirements provided by the Small Business Administration in order to meet its small business contracting goals.

The PWS enables the NRC to fulfill its mission of communicating sensitive information to licensees and developing more formal, long-term relationships with Federal, State, and local organizations with shared responsibilities for protecting nuclear facilities and activities and responding to incidents.  Further, the PWS fulfills a valuable need in relation to the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative (NSI) which began in 2008.  The PWS is the NRC's contribution to this important national initiative to centralize suspicious activity reporting in the interest of assessing national trends across industries and critical infrastructure.","ERDS is Federally Regulated through 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50.72.A.4, which states that the licensee must activate ERDS within one hour after the licensee declares an emergency at an emergency class level of ""alert"" or higher (higher means the declaration of a ""site area emergency"" or ""general emergency"").OCIMS: This activity supports compliance and oversight, in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and the NRC's cyber security program.

Providers use a mechanism known as CONNECT gateway to electronically submit medical documentation to Recovery Auditors and other Review Contractors using NHIN technologies.","009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The esMD system supports the CMS strategic goal to improve health care and population health through the meaningful use of health information technology.  The following performance metrics are tracked in support of the strategic goal: count of medical records submitted via esMD, count of PA requests submitted via esMD, the percent of the efficiency of the utilization of resources on the project for program activities, percentage of production system availability and the count of responses processed via esMD. 

The esMD system also increases the electronic exchange of medical documentation resulting in administration simplification/paperwork reduction and reducing improper payment rates.  Based on calculations related to the reduction of paperwork, the use of esMD results in postage savings and resource savings – i.e. reduction/elimination of document imaging, mail room related costs and storage facility expenses.  The use of esMD has resulted in a savings of $34.52 per transaction.

esMD contributes to achieving CMS’s strategic goal of healthcare fraud and abuse control by assisting with the measurement, prevention, identification and correction of Medicare improper payments. RCs identify improper payments and manually review claims against medical documentation obtained to verify the provider’s compliance with Medicare rules.  The performance measure results associated with this alignment are used to track the total Medicare trust fund dollars that are protected and/or recovered.

One of the main goals CPI achieves via the use of esMD is providing excellent operations and support services, which is tracked via daily, weekly and monthly dashboards using a measure of system availability and successful transaction count.","OMB passed the Paperwork Reduction Action (PRA) to minimize the paperwork burden resulting from the collection of information by the federal government.  
 
The Medicare Program makes billions in improper payments each year.  As a result, CMS employs several types of Review Contractors (RC) to prevent and to identify, measure, and correct improper payments.  The RCs identify improper payments by selecting a small sample of claims, requesting medical documentation from the providers who submitted the claims and manually reviewing the claims against the medical documentation to verify the provider’s compliance with Medicare regulations.  The RCs request medical documentation by sending Additional Documentation Request (ADR) letters the providers by mail.  In the past, providers had only two options for submitting the requested documentation – sending by mail or fax.  In accordance with the PRA, esMD was created to enable providers to electronically respond to ADR requests and submit supporting medical documentation to the requesting RC.  The submission of medical documentation electronically has resulted in increased efficiencies in the claims medical review process, as well as a reduction in the Medicare provider paperwork burden.  Over the next 18 months, the esMD system will continue to be modernized by enabling the automation of the following CMS lines of business and programs: ADR Letter Responses, First Level Appeals Requests and Prior Authorization Requests for Power Mobility Devices and Non-Emergent Ambulance Transport.

We combine the benefits of shared services with knowledge of and compliance with all Federal HR and IT policies in one solution for end-to-end talent acquisition. USAS includes system management, technical support, advanced analytics, streamlined data interconnections, and trusted consulting and training from OPM experts.

USAS enables Federal agencies to effectively recruit, assess, certify, and onboard candidates for Federal positions using all hiring flexibilities available while complying with Federal rules and procedures. With access to agency applicant flow and time to hire data, USAS positions the Federal government to recruit and select the right talent to meet its varied missions. USAS works closely with the agency stakeholders, CIO, assessment, and staffing communities to ensure that the system meets the needs of its users.

USAS is a mature system that represents over 35 years of automating the Federal hiring process. More than 14,000 HR professionals and 110,000 hiring officials across Government use USAS. USAS averages 12,000 open vacancies on USAJOBS and 250,000 job applications per week. More than 287,000 selections were made in fiscal year 2017 using USAS.

USAS operates on a Software as a Service model by offering access remotely through web browsers while the software and data are hosted within OPM s infrastructure. Customers like DoD, VA, HHS, DHS and DOJ select USA Staffing because it accommodates high volume hiring and a full range of hiring processes. By hosting USAS and USA Hire for all Federal customers, OPM has achieved significant economies of scale, allowing OPM to expand system functionality while maintaining steady and predictable pricing.

USA Hire offers agencies the capability to deliver innovative online assessment solutions in proctored and unproctored environments. With more than 900 off-the-shelf assessments, 650 test center locations, and assessment and IT expertise, OPM can develop, customize, and deliver assessment solutions that meet the needs of Federal agencies. OPM built USA Hire for civil service assessment. USA Hire fully integrates with USAS and maintains high levels of usability. Agencies can use the USA Hire platform to administer a wide variety of online assessments that range from multiple-choice to sophisticated simulations, video-based assessments, and computer-scored writing assessments.","027SO18172 - Drive improvements to the hiring process so agencies are able to hire the best candidate in a timely manner","As a shared service, USAS and USA Hire are designed to provide excellent talent acquisition technology and services for agencies through economies of scale. USAS was developed to automate the Federal hiring process, first in support of OPM hiring activities on behalf of agencies, then to support complex federal hiring practices in a compliant, user-friendly environment. USA Hire was created to allow all agencies the opportunity for competency-based occupational assessments through government-wide job analysis. Agencies have a choice when seeking talent acquisition solutions. Several agencies have built in-house staffing systems, others procure a private-sector staffing system, some partner with OPM or a Shared Service Center to conduct staffing work for them. Over 80% of federal hiring is conducted using USAS s single platform, single line of code significantly reducing procurement, IT management, and customization costs.

Each USAS agency customer has a representative on the Advisory Board. Advisory Board members provide feedback to USAS regarding what system functionality and usability enhancements best meets their needs.  Applicants and new hires are able to submit feedback through the help desk and satisfaction surveys. This feedback allows OPM to add significant user value to USAS by expanding system functionality while maintaining steady, predictable pricing. Additionally, USAS has developed standardized interconnections for agency customers  downstream systems. These are being used across government to improve data quality, eliminate re-entry and eOPF submissions, create process transparency and streamline hiring processes.

Agencies may choose to use USA Hire as part of their assessment strategy. USA Hire offers Federal agencies the following benefits:  assessments designed to measure competencies critical to success across Federal occupations; applicant-friendly, off-the-shelf assessments for 120 occupational series; innovative online assessments (simulations, computer-adaptive testing, and automatically-scored writing assessments); and, support of OPM personnel psychologists with expertise in implementing high-quality, legally defensible assessments for use in Federal hiring.

From 1994 through 1996, the Bureau negotiated contracts, procured equipment, and deployed LANs in nearly 60 institutions, six regional offices and the Central Office.  In 1997, all of these LANs were interconnected into a single wide area network (WAN). This IT infrastructure network of LANs, which are joined into a WAN via the Justice Telecommunications Network (JUTNet) is referred to as BOPNet. BOPNet is comprised of the BOP wide area network (WAN), the collection of local area networks (LAN), and network administration/authentication services used to provide BOP wide area networking. It interconnects the LANs across all BOP facilities, which includes correctional facilities, regional offices, community corrections offices and the central office.

The BOPNet computing infrastructure is used for the deployment of applications and as the means of communication to transfer messages and data. The infrastructure contains approximately 31,000 workstations and provides access to file and print services, email, the Internet, and various office productivity applications.

USAJOBS delivers a service by which Federal agencies meet their legal obligation (5 USC 3327/5 USC 3330) providing public notice of Federal employment opportunities to Federal employees and the general public. USAJOBS is funded by agency fees, assessed on a pro rata share of the expenses to run the program. The investment provides a basis of support for the OPM Director's Strategic Plan, specifically, Goal 1, Transforming hiring, pay and benefits across the Federal Government to attract and retain the best civilian employees.  Success and continued progress of goals are tied to USAJOBS website and its ability to manage integration of other agency systems w/ USAJOBS  (OMB Memo M-09-20 to  Provide Applicant Status  during selection process). USAJOBS has an imperative to create a seamless and consistent hiring process for the job seeker.

USAJOBS shifted from providing a job board to creating a Federal Career Portal focused on delivering a personalized candidate experience in order to connect job seekers to the agencies  brand, value and job opportunities. Overall, we are working to improve the way we collect user profile information so we can leverage that data to guide job seekers through the federal hiring process. One of our biggest challenges is to introduce and provide clarity around eligibility, which is the unique factor in federal hiring. It is our goal to reduce the number of ineligible applications submitted to agencies. In addition to the recruitment tools, USAJOBS acquired an existing platform, Open Opportunities, to fold into the Federal Career Portal. This platform showcases developmental micro-details. USAJOBS has integrated this platform into the career portal to offer federal employees a place to find and apply to developmental opportunities and aggregate these experiences in their profile.

USAJOBS is iteratively building a new service, the Agency Talent Portal (ATP), for agency users to collaborate within a recruitment workspace to develop strategic recruitment plans that will build a robust talent network of recruitment partners, understand the real-time health of an agency talent pipeline, and create targeted recruitment campaigns that include a meaningful event experience. By offering strategic tools that work in parallel with agencies and job seekers, we are increasing the ability to connect these groups, reducing wasted time and increasing match quality.","027SO18172 - Drive improvements to the hiring process so agencies are able to hire the best candidate in a timely manner","Since USAJOBS provides a central portal/repository for Job Opportunity Announcements, the cost savings alone provide significant benefits to net a positive return on investment.  Currently, USAJOBS supports 135 customers who do not have to spend investment dollars to build and maintain individual job boards and interfaces to support the job posting process.  In addition, benefits include lower costs for interoperability, because USAJOBS provides a Staffing Integration Framework (SIF) that is adopted by the Talent Acquisition Systems (TASs).  As a result, agencies do not have to pay for point-to-point interfaces to USAJOBS.  In addition, the SIF also lowers the barrier-to-entry for new Talent Acquisition System providers, which enables the government to seek better value solutions for its hiring needs.  Lastly, the benefits of USAJOBS includes streamlined reporting capabilities to remove/reduce hiring-related data calls pertaining to the dataset collected in USAJOBS.

USAJOBS estimates it helps agencies avoid anywhere from a $250,000 to $10M investment in creating its own job and opportunity boards. We are able to provide third party recruitment partners access to the 200K+ job announcements posted each year at no cost. We also carry the burden of securing the data and managing the job seeker/applicant's privacy which significantly reduces risk and avoids cost burdens for the agency.

USAJOBS is targeting a 10% reduction in ineligible applicants in FY19, now that the hiring paths are implemented and change management activities are underway. This can net a governmentwide costs savings of over $4M (i.e., 11,040,380 USA Staffing applications x 10% = 1,104,038 applications), Federal HR labor costs could decrease by approximately $4.1M  annually.

It consolidates information from the core financial system to support strategic and operational reporting requirements. FBIS offers business intelligence and analytics to support decision-making, including metrics and key performance indicators, dashboards with graphical displays, interactive reports, and ad-hoc reporting. FBIS is a web-based application built on the Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) COTS platform. 

The FBIS investment is designed to establish an information-driven financial management environment where stakeholders at all levels across the organization have access to timely and accurate information required for measuring performance, increasing transparency, and enhancing decision-making. This will allow the Department to more effectively and efficiently meet evolving information demands for fiscal accountability, performance improvement, and external compliance requirements in a sustainable manner. 

Specific benefits include: simplifying information access to business users; producing timely, holistic, and actionable insights by combining relevant cross-functional data; standardizing business vocabulary to improve consistency of reports; assuring data quality; addressing evolving government mandates, responding to Congressional inquiries; and building a culture of data-driven decision-making. 

FBIS was first deployed in 2012 with limited functionality and 120 users. It has been incrementally expanded since, adding functionality and increasing to over 1,500 users as of June 2018. In December 2015, FBIS hosting and management transitioned to a cloud service provider, and HHS was able to retire three legacy managerial reporting solutions, as functionality and users were incorporated into FBIS. 

FBIS continues to progress on its roadmap to provide cutting-edgebusiness intelligence and analytics for users across HHS’s diverse lines of business (finance, budget, grants, acquisitions, etc.). Current and future initiatives include projects to incrementally expand FBIS to include new domains (and potentially retire additional legacy systems); enhancements to FBIS to improve functionality and analytic capabilities; and support for Treasury requirements.","009SO18220 - Ensure responsible financial management, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The FBIS investment enables enterprise-wide analytics and business intelligence, facilitates an information-driven financial management environment, and provides stakeholders with access to timely and accurate information to support decision-making and increased transparency. Since implementation, FBIS has reduced HHS’s reliance on manual data calls to support external and managerial reporting, improved data integration across Divisions, and increased the accuracy, timeliness, and availability of data to support decision making and respond to inquiries.

Virtually all schools, third party student loan servicers, GAs, federal loan servicers, FSA External Partners, State Agencies, and other organizations must use PM to enroll in FSA data services provided by FSA systems like NSLDS, COD, FMS, SAIG, AIMS, CPS, FAA Access, TPD, and DMCS. PM currently manages over 20,000 enrollments in these FSA data services annually. The investment in PM supports ongoing operations, maintenance, and customer support to manage collecting and integrating service enrollment information, and sharing that information in a timely manner across FSA systems as well as support to make incremental upgrades to its service.
If the PM system is not funded, the process of granting access to services provided by each of our various systems would become fragmented, causing confusion and security risks as certain tasks become impossible. For example, without PM, tracking of user enrollments, ensuring that only proper organization types are granted access to certain FSA services, and ensuring that inactive users are deactivated from those services when they no longer require them would be extremely difficult. Further, timely communication between FSA s various service-provider systems on user service eligibility updates would be next to impossible, causing public delays in access to vital FSA services on the front end, and delays to service discontinuances on the back-end, causing potentially serious security problems. And without a single system of record for tracking enrollment rights, FSA would be left with a patch-work of enrollment data stored on several systems, with probable data conflicts between those systems.

The prime contract was awarded in June 2016. The program’s purpose is to deliver to tower Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) and FAA traffic managers NextGen decision support capabilities that integrate flight, surface surveillance, and traffic management information. TFDM will provide an approach for the collection, distribution, and update of flight data information in the terminal area and to improve access to information for the safe and efficient control of air traffic. The use of Electronic Flight Data and Strips (EFD/EFS) will allow tower controllers to maintain an integrated view of the air traffic environment, improving situational awareness of airport operations. TFDM will also provide more efficient and safe airport operations by management of airport surface traffic sequencing and scheduling. TFDM will automate the manual flight data processes to enable enhanced data sharing between the Tower, the En Route, and Approach Control ATCs, Traffic Flow Management (TFM), and Flight/Airline Operations domains. This eliminates the necessity of physical exchange of flight data, reduces telephone exchange of data between facilities, and reduces manual re-entry of data among multiple ATC systems. This will also facilitate data exchange with aviation partners (airlines and flight operators) to support collaborative decision making. TFDM will support the DOT Strategic Goals: Support Economic Competitiveness by providing airports and airlines with tools to decrease fuel consumption and increase surface and terminal airspace efficiencies; Livable Communities by decreasing the environmental impact of air travel on communities surrounding airports. The program will support the FAA Strategic Goal, Deliver Benefits through Technology and Infrastructure, by focusing to achieve the benefits of NextGen and by supporting right-sizing the NAS. TFDM also continues to support the recommendations of the NextGen Advisory Council (NAC). Improving surface operations and data sharing with the operators rated high in the NAC report. TFDM will deliver multiple NAS benefits; reduced surface delay, taxi time, fuel burn, and reduced CO2 emissions, improved airport utilization during times when demand exceeds capacity, improved shared situational awareness and enhanced safety.","021SO18098 - System Operations and Performance","TFDM will provide benefits to the government and to FAA users by electronically processing and distributing flight data to different control positions in the tower and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON); providing a suite of Decision Support Tools (DSTs), including surface management tools, that assist controllers in providing more efficient and safe airport operations; and beginning the consolidation of disparate legacy tower systems.   
The benefits to Flight Operators will be; improved predictability, less taxi time/out fuel burn, and improved crew utilization.  TFDM will provide Air Traffic Control with better information for tactical rerouting, fewer aircraft in the movement area and departure queue, better section demand loading predictions, improved predictability, and fewer restrictions.  Airport Operators will benefit from a reduced CO2 footprint, improved predictability, and reduced engine noise. For the flying public, TFDM will provide the benefits of more predictable air travel, fewer delays, more reliable schedule completion, reduced taxi time and time spent on the tarmac.  TFDM will also decrease environmental impact through reduced aircraft fuel burn and 3 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.
The TFDM benefits were estimated in terms of cost avoidance, flight efficiency gains, and safety.  The total lifecycle risk-adjusted benefits for the program in FY16 dollars is approximately $2.2 billion. The ROI calculation for the TFDM program consists of a positive benefit to cost (B/C) ratio of 1.03 and a net present value of $17 million.

Current benefits of BPES: 1) Improved Information Sharing and Management–enables the automatic collection, dissemination and analysis of critical asset and personnel data, improving USBP’s situational awareness and the identification of resources to improve border enforcement and security through resource prioritization. 2) Improved System and Process Integration–supports new innovative approaches to exchange information and integrate USBP technology. These efforts help USBP develop efficient day-to-day processes for agents, and reduce operational costs by providing timely information across various CBP systems. 3) Rapid Response Ability–enables USBP to gain greater situational awareness, using sensors along the border, to support rapid response to interdict those crossing the border illegally. Key stakeholders/customers/beneficiaries: 1) Internal CBP: USBP, Office of Field Operations (OFO), Office of Acquisition (OA), Air and Marine Operations (AMO), and Office of Intelligence (OI); 2) Within DHS: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Coast Guard (USCG),Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Science and Technology (S&T), Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS); 3) External to DHS: US Department of Justice (DOJ), US Department of Defense (DOD), Department of State (DOS), White House, Congress, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Government Accountability Office (GAO), Inspectors General (IG); 4) External to the federal government: general public, state and local governments, foreign governments (e.g., Canadian and Mexican governments).","024APG18014 - Enhance Southern Border Security","The primary benefit of BPES is the facilitation and support of border enforcement mission essential tasks for all 22,500 discrete BPES users, mainly USBP Agents. Without BPES, USBP would be unable to perform critical functions to detect, identify, classify and resolve illegal border activity, thus limiting the effectiveness of the USBP mission and endangering national security. For example, some BPES capabilities improve agent efficiency by 100% - meaning these tasks would be virtually impossible without BPES. Based on this alone, benefits of the BPES investment far exceed the total lifecycle cost of $609M.  In addition, USBP, CBP, other DHS Components (e.g., ICE, CIS, USCG, FEMA, S&T), other federal agencies (e.g., DOJ, DOS and DOD), state, local and foreign governments benefit from BPES by having access to shared information that heighten situational awareness and risk-based decision-making. These agencies achieve cost avoidance from not having to build their own systems, eliminating redundant processes, manpower and operational costs while addressing their missions quickly and effectively. BPES captures information on criminal prosecution activities, facilitating court submissions to DOJ. It also provides real-time border surveillance and monitoring of agent activity and officer safety used by law enforcement. BPES provides workforce staffing information and tracks operational metrics linked with DHS, the FBI and ICE. This integration improves decision-making and supports the rapid deployment of USBP resources while reducing operational costs. BPES provides statistical reports that CBP and multiple DHS components (e.g., FEMA, ICE, CIS) use for strategic and tactical decision-making. It enables USBP to provide reliable statistical information in response to White House, Congress, OMB, GAO, IG, IA and other federal agency requirements, including those of the Departments of State and Justice. State governments, such as the State of Texas, and foreign governments, such as the Governments of Canada, Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala also use information. While BPES shares information with other agencies, it also leverages information and technologies developed or used by other agencies. e3 leverages the ICE Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) by pulling related data that reduces data re-entry and expedites data sharing. e3’s Biometrics leverages FBI’s IAFIS, US-VISIT’s IDENT and DoD’s ABIS biometrics search/enroll interfaces/repositories. Finally, the future modernization of BPES will achieve even greater cost savings and cost avoidance by significantly improving ease of use, integration, and reducing redundancy. The program will conduct a full ROI analysis on the modernization effort in FY2020. The 0.00 value in the table below is per previous DHS guidance as BPES does not have an AoA, which would contain the ROI.","BPES fulfills the requirements of the following laws: 
1) Immigration and Nationality Act (1965) which bases immigration rules to a preference system focused on immigrants' skills and family relationships. BPES supports this act by providing ICE access to databases to ensure legal border entries. http://library.uwb.edu/static/usimmigration/1965_immigration_and_nationality_act.html 
2) Border Protection Agent Pay Reform Act (BPAPRA) (2014) which provides a new method of compensating USBP agents for overtime work. This law affects only USBP agents in CBP. BPES complied with BPAPRA in January 2016, enabling USBP agents to enter their overtime pay and obtain compensation based on the new approach. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1691/text 
3) Flores Agreement (1997) provides guidance on the treatment of Unaccompanied Children (UAC). e3, a BPES system that manages processing and prosecution of all apprehended subjects, ensures compliance to stated guidelines. https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/flores_settlement_final_plus_extension_of_settlement011797.pdf 
4) FITARA (2014) requires increased CIO visibility in budget formulation, planning, acquisition and execution. BPES is working on ensuring alignment with the federal budget process and providing more detailed and accurate data, as required. BPES complied with the recent DHS CIO data call on planned IT Expenditure Reporting. BPES recently completed a detailed Current Program Estimate (CPE), built from the ground up and with inputs from a vast array of BPES stakeholders. The CPE is an important input to the BY18 BPES Business Case. Moreover, it will be a living document from which future BPES Resource Allocation Plans will be developed. https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1232

The G2 system is widely used across NNSA to manage approximately $2.3B of annual appropriations with mission activities ranging from managing real property and equipment data for over 6,400 NNSA assets with a replacement plant value of nearly $50B to preventing state and non-state actors from developing nuclear weapons or acquiring weapons-usable nuclear or radioactive materials, equipment, technology, and expertise. 

At the NNSA project level, the G2 system integrates scope, schedule, budget, and metrics information for Headquarters and Management and Operating (M&O) Partners, creating a single repository of participating program data. G2 also has execution-level modules for management oversight, data collection, analysis, and tracking and provides access to the data thru graphical representations, geographic information system (GIS) maps, business intelligence (BI), and on-demand reports.

The NNSA G2 investment meets the requirement of use of a standardized project management approach as set forth in DOE Order 415.1,  Information Technology Project Management,  by utilizing Project Management Institute (PMI) best practices contained in the PMBOK Guide. In addition to requirements from DOE Order 415.1, tenets of the Agile development method in conjunction with the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe ) will be used for G2 system development. In 2011, the original G2 project (upon which this investment is predicated) won the Project Management Institute (PMI) Distinguished Project Award.  In 2015, the project won the Association for Enterprise Information (AFEI) Excellence in Enterprise Information Award.  Also in 2015, the G2 system was announced by the Secretary of Energy as one of 15 DOE best practices.

By providing NNSA with financial tracking, management oversight, data collection, analysis, and reporting capabilities within the G2 system, the NNSA G2 investment aligns with DOE Agency Strategic Objectives.  Due to the ongoing nature of DOE Strategic Objectives, NNSA tracking and oversight against these Objectives (as well as at the program level within NNSA itself) will continue to be required, thereby substantiating the need for the G2 investment as a priority for the department.","0 - Not Applicable","The G2 system, as created by this investment, improves the efficiency by which federal employees perform NNSA program management activities, thereby reducing direct management costs.

Since inception, over 63.5 Million electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) transactions in excess of $8.9 Billion have been processed through the SVC e-commerce program. SVC helps Fiscal Service reach the President's mandate to complete government-wide implementation of shared electronic commerce solutions. SVC has effectively replaced or reduced cash at over 80 military bases and installations in 19 countries (including the U.S.) and on over 130 Navy ships. The primary goal of the SVC program is to provide a cost effective solution for the government that enables them to meet their electronic cash management needs. In this effort, SVC is consolidating the current three separate and distinct SVC programs (EZpay, EagleCash, and Navy Cash/Marine Cash) into a universal One-Card Solution to minimize duplication, avoid proprietary technologies, and gain more economies of scale through reuse of shared services across military services. The successful consolidation will result in a cost savings of over $481 million by FY 2022.  

SVC's key customers are the military starting in basic training and continuing on through the life of the military personnel while deployed on land as well as on ships at sea. The primary stakeholders are: The Departments of the U.S. Army, Air Force, Marine Corp. and Navy; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS); Navy Supply System (NAVSUP); Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB); Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (FRBKC); and PNC Bank.","015SO18106 - Trusted Currency and Services: Deliver trusted currency and services that enable citizens and businesses to participate in the economy, 015SO18117 - Federal Financial Performance: Improve federal financial management performance using innovative practices to support effective government., 015SO18120 - Customer Value: Improve customer value by increasing the quality and lowering the cost of Treasury's products and services.","For the next 5 years, SVC estimates cost benefit of approximately $480 million, or an ROI of approximately 99 percent, an increase from prior years due to an increase of the program’s footprint. In addition, cost savings are gained from synergies and economies of scale as the One-Card Solution initiative progresses.
There are 4 alternatives to consider in solving the cash management issue for the military: 
Alt. 1 (Status Quo of the Stored Value Card One-Card) satisfies the Department of Defense’s (DoD) requirements for a deployable financial system suitable in remote and dangerous theaters of operation without traditional banking or telecommunication infrastructure, be administered locally by non-technical military personnel, and is secure, easy to use, scalable, fully auditable, and cost effective. Projected cost benefit by the end of FY2021 is $439.6M.
Alt. 2 (Common Access Card (CAC) with SVC Application) would only decrease card costs while requiring additional development costs to apply the SVC application to the CAC. This option would reduce SVC’s footprint since not everyone who currently uses SVC has access to or can obtain a CAC (i.e., merchants, contractors, etc.). Based on current costs and estimated development costs the projected cost benefit by the end of FY2021 is $440.6M.
Alt. 3 (Cash) would re-introduce cash and coins at military locations around the world. Costs would increase for the military to ship cash to the current SVC locations. The projected cost benefit by the end of FY2021 is $345.6M.
Alt. 4 (Debit/Gift Cards), Debit cards utilize “on-line” technology and require the POS to authenticate the card in order for the purchase to take place. This technology is not utilized for SVC since the authentication takes place between the card and the POS or issuing device. Debit card authentication is much more time intensive than SVC as it has to dial out to a system to authorize the payment. Outside the U.S. this dial out capability does not exist for all the locations currently using SVC. As a viable alternative, placement of equipment would be determined by locations with electronic capabilities. DoD would need to install more power and phone systems or eliminate usage in places that do not, or cannot, have power and, or phone. This would greatly reduce the program’s capability to accommodate DoD’s needs. The projected cost benefit by the end of FY2021 is $323.6M.","President Obama (Oct. 2014) signed an Executive Order mandating the use of chip-and-pin EMV (Europay, Mastercard & Visa) technology for all government debit, credit, and payment cards.  The chip that SVC uses will be the EMV chip with the One-Card.

The investment’s principal users are CMS, CMS contractors, Federal agencies and external researchers who use it to support research designed to improve the quality of care and reduce costs and utilization. Customer satisfaction is assessed by surveys during training classes and assessments during help desk phone calls. The results of this process are summarized with comparisons between service level provided and goals for the users’ expectations.

The CCW is providing customers with the needed functionality and performance that they need.  There are monthly updates to the CCW where downtime only occurs on weekends or overnight.  The website is run smoothly and without complications.  When there is an issue, the team will figure it out as soon as it is reported.  This investment is performing to our expectations with customer satisfaction based on it being fully functional.

Quantitative ROI:

Performance measurement actions were effective.  In order to meet next year’s performance goals, the investment needs to continue its current management and operational practices.  To date, performance goals were consistently met and/or exceeded.

The financial performance was well within the PMT budget goal for last year (2016-2017-Our 2017-2018 budget is still active until April 29, 2018).  Our scheduled budget was 30.212 million dollars and we spent 28.902 million dollars. The resultant budget variance was a favorable 1.309 million dollars, or a Cost Variance of Positive 4.3% (under budget).  

There is a positive variance in all, but one category.  For the percent of scheduled up-time the system is available, we met the goal because the site was never down.  The CCW was consistently live for all customers and users.  As for responding to incidents within 24 hours, the contractor always responded to a user within 24 hours.  The CCW only had 3 months that were above our allotted 25 calls to the help desk for speed of the CCW.  Last year, we had asmall budget variance that we went over budget by 4.5% which is within our goal.  Our target to get all data loaded into the CCW is 99% and we had 100% of the data loaded.  All in all, we had a good target and goal for all 5 categories.  The number of calls to the help desk was realistic because with as many users as we have, there are bound to be slow times.  We also stayed within the 5% of the allotted budget.","Section 723 of the MMA (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ173/pdf/PLAW-108publ173.pdf) outlined a plan to improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries.

These authorizations ensure the safe movement of regulated agricultural articles into, out of, and through the United States, and are issued by four (4) operational program units namely, Animal Care (AC), Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) and Veterinary Services (VS). Each program unit utilizes separate information technology (IT) systems, as well as a number of manual processes, to support those authorizations. These separate systems often collect redundant data that cannot be shared due to lack of data standardization and data inconsistencies, and result in increased employees workload, and delays for customers. Because these systems have commonalities in their business workflows, APHIS is seeking to gain efficiency through an integrated CARPOL solution. The investment goals are to implement an integrated web-based, secure, scalable, configurable COTS solution (called APHIS eFile), and to interface APHIS eFile with other systems utilized by the program units for supporting activities. The anticipated benefits are reduction in system development, maintenance, and enhancement (DME) costs, elimination of redundant systems, improved and streamlined business processes and business rules, improved governance and collaboration, data standardization, improved business intelligence, reduction in reliance on manual processes, reduction in authorizations cycle time, and improved customer service.","005SO18001 - Modernize information technology infrastructure, facilities and support services to improve the customer experience., 005SO18004 - Improve stewardship of resources and utilize data-driven analyses to maximize the return on investment., 005SO18287 - Protect agricultural health by preventing and mitigating the spread of agricultural pests and disease.","A feasibility study was conducted to evaluate the alternative approaches to implementing the proposed CARPOL solution and determine whether the alternatives would be technically, financially, and operationally viable. It was determined that the most viable option with the highest return on investment (ROI) would be a COTS system. It was estimated that it would cost $42 million over a 10-years period, to configure and customize a COTS system to support APHIS  CARPOL services. The savings is $10 million when compared with maintaining existing systems, and $14 million when compared with re-engineering existing systems. This is exclusive of the cost for data migration from the existing systems. Data migration will be funded separately by the program units. The estimated cost is $1 million. The internal and external benefits include:  reduction in system development and maintenance, and enhancement (DME) costs, improved and streamlined business processes across program units, improved data management, improved business intelligence, reduction in authorization cycle time, and improved customer service.","The Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1988 (GPEA)

A Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) financial system (in a private-vendor hosted environment) formerly provided by GSA is being transitioned to USDA. This shared-service operation is utilized to cross service dozens of external client agencies. As a Federal shared services provider for larger customers, USDA serves as the manager of a public/private partnership providing IT hosting of a FSIO-certified core financial system that enables client agencies to leverage government-wide standard business processes, data and economies of scale. USDA also has the capability to offer additional value-added services to agencies beyond just core financial management system functions. The current customer base consists of GSA Services and Staff Offices and over 40 external client agencies. The dozens of financial management client agencies are successfully using the Pegasys application as their financial management system of record. After the transition from GSA to USDA is complete, Pegasys Financial Services (PFS) has the goal of providing services to more external client agencies.

The Return on Investment (ROI) for current and budget years will be realized in coming outyears. Achieving cost and quality improvements through the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLOB) is one of the President’s top management priorities, according to the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The implementation of Pegasys creates two distinct FMLOB offerings from USDA, and having two offerings will increase competition within the shared services space and will in turn increase USDA’s ability to facilitate stronger internal controls that ensure integrity in accounting, reduce costs by providing a competitive alternative, standardize systems, business processes and data elements, and provide for seamless data exchange between and among Federal agencies. Most importantly, the greatest long term ROI will be achieved through increased competition among agencies providing FMLOB services. Creating a more competitive environment is achieved through transparency and standardization. Investing in Pegasys will help achieve many of the strategic goals laid out by USDA as well as the goals created by the EOP, and will create positive ROI for USDA and the Federal Government.","Pegasys provides financial management for the entire USDA that compiles with Federal accounting and system standards.

In FY2016, FSA acquired a software as a service (SaaS) solution. The acquisition activity led to implementation of the Salesforce/SaaS with Community of Practice Service Module. SaaS includes the enabling design/development products, services, support licensing, operations and maintenance (O&M) as inclusive services in the delivery model. The finished delivered platform product (the Customer Engagement Management System (CEMS)) was designed and enabled to meet the FSA requirements need.  The delivered CEMS also includes training support on the use of the products/services to meet ongoing, continuous customer-engagement activities, both internally and externally managed and operated, as needed.  CEMS provides Workflow Management, Contact Management, Integrated Customer View, Multi- or Omni-Channel Support, Case Management, Knowledge Management, Integration with Legacy Systems, Correspondence and Cloud hosting or cloud-ready on-site  support.  The current acquired solution of the Customer Engagement Management System (CEMS)  directly enables shared customer-to-client information gathering engagement; activity history and update function, activity tracking and reporting, outreach enabled capabilities (social media, web-chat, virtualized conversation agents, etc.), e-delivery service solutions to federal student clients/customers utilizing FSA products (federal student loans, et. al.), and services (policy update messaging, regulation clarification contacts to Financial Aid Administrators, etc.) and school administrative assistance.  Initially CEMS was created for the Ombudsman Group but the platform has grown to include other applications such as Feedback, Borrower Defense, OIG Fraud Group, Awareness & Outreach and Minority Serving Under Represented Schools.  This has resulted in a return on investment and cost savings in the security compliance, improved business processes and data security.","018SO18042 - Support educational institutions, students, parents and communities to increase access and completion of college, lifelong learning and career, technical and adult education., 018SO18045 - Improve quality of service for customers across the entire student aid life cycle., 018SO18046 - Enhance students' and parents' ability to repay their federal student loans by providing accurate and timely information, relevant tools and manageable repayment options.","This investment does not result in any direct cost savings or avoidance, but rather supports a Congressionally-mandated service to the public. It does provide a very significant benefit to the student loan borrowers who call seeking resolution of issues with their student loans. For each borrower callers whose issue is resolved and does not go into default, FSA and the taxpayers may avoid the costs of the callers loans associated with a defaulted loan.","The Student Loan Ombudsman is mandated by Congress in the Higher Education Act, as amended, 20USC1018.SEC.141 (f). The Student Loan Ombudsman provides timely assistance to borrowers of loans made, insured, or guaranteed under Title IV. The Feedback and Dispute Management System (FDMS) is the primary information technology resource used by the Ombudsman Group to meet the directed mandates of Congress to assist borrowers, track issues and complaints, and document and report on activities. 

On March 10, 2015, President Obama continued his vision for affordable quality education for all Americans through the creation of a Student Aid Bill of Rights (SABR). In order to implement the vision of the SABR, the Memorandum directed DoED and other Federal Agencies to improve accessibility, quality, and experience of the Federal Student Aid Lifecycle. The Memorandum included the creation of a state-of-the art complaints system to ensure quality, service, and accountability for the DoED, its contractors, colleges, and loan servicers. This is now known as FDMS. The goal of FDMS is to improve the ease of use of complaint intake mechanisms for customers, simplify FSA s complaint tracking, resolution, and storage processes, and improve analytical and reporting capabilities. 

Under the Higher Education Act (Sec.455(h)), a student loan may be forgiven under certain circumstances: borrower's death or disability, closure of the school the borrower attends; public service overtime; false certification by the institution of the borrower's eligibility for federal student aid; and certain institutional misconduct harmful to the student.  The last of these is referred to as a borrower defense. FSA determined a need to review the existing and future requirements to support borrower defense across technology, contractors and operations.  It was determined to leverage the CEMS platform for the development, operations and maintenance for the borrower defense application. The application will support the review processes for borrower defense.

EDWA allows for timely, accurate, consistent, and repeatable data for improved analytics, insights, and reporting, and allows FSA to responsibly expand data available for public consumption and research. Having absorbed data and replacing both the D2I and Aid Data Mart systems, users of those systems are now able to complete their functions and analyses using more up-to-date and consistent data. This includes, among others, the Audit Support Group in the FSA Finance Business Unit (BU) who through the use of EDWA, are able to prep servicer submissions for audit review. Additionally, EDWA provides the necessary reporting to the Business Operations BU to facilitate Split-Borrower processing and analysis. In addition to using EDWA to generate monthly portfolio metrics reporting to FSA senior management, the Enterprise Data Office (EDO) also uses EDWA to provide data in response to external data requests and provide monthly updates and regular additions to data provided to the public on the FSA Data Center. The EDO analytics team, using EDWA, has developed a number of products including an identity validation model that has been inserted into the Central Processing System (CPS) to flag questionable user identities for enhanced scrutiny.

The current system is browser-based to meet the needs of FWS/OLE and FWS/RLE officers and staff throughout the United States.  LEMIS contains many investigative components including Strategic Planning, Case Management, Incident Management, Undercover Operations, and Intelligence.

Additionally, FWS/OLE owns and maintains the Electronic Declarations system (eDecs) created as a direct response to the general public, third party filer requests for an eGov system designed to sharply reduce the amount of paperwork required when filing the FWS Form 3-177 Declaration of the Importation or Exportation of Fish or Wildlife.

Our mission is to protect wildlife resources.  Through the effective enforcement of Federal laws, we contribute to the Fish and Wildlife Service s efforts to restore endangered species, conserve migratory birds, preserve wildlife habitat, safeguard fisheries, combat invasive species, and promote international wildlife conservation.

The unique features of the FWS/OLE LEMIS and Electronic Declarations systems directly support this mission as much of the functionality in LEMIS has been developed and enhanced to assist OLE officers not only with day-to-day operations, but to measure performance with respect to the OLE Strategic Plan.  Most OLE law enforcement activity is investigation based and LEMIS provides many specific features to address the wide variety of cases involving everything from the seizure of illegally imported wildlife to large scale covert operations including the management of an undercover business.  

Supported OLE strategic goals include:  Wildlife Protection, Global Wildlife Trafficking, Facilitate Legal Trade, Management Accountability, Enforcement Partnerships, and Compliance.

Imports include both 801a and 801m responsibilities, to ensure imports that do not meet regulations are not admitted into commerce and to protect against possible bioterrorism threats. The work includes all of the stages of import review, including the steps needed to review PNs, make admissibility decisions, and address imports that are detained or refused entry.
GOALS - IMPORTS supports FDA Strategic Goal 1: Enhance Oversight of FDA-Regulated Products Objective 1.2: Reduce risks in the manufacturing, production and distribution of FDA-regulated products; Objective 1.3: Strengthening detection and surveillance of problems with FDA-regulated product; Objective 1.4: Improve Response to identified and emerging problems with FDA-regulated products; Goal 4: Strengthen Organizational Excellence and Accountability Objective 4.2: Improve the overall operation and effectiveness of FDA.
CURRENT/ANTICIPATED BENEFITS - IMPORTS benefits the public by enabling import functions that ensure product safety in the supply chain. IMPORTS expands ORA’s ability to share data with other public health organizations improving the nation’s ability to detect, identify, and respond to health emergencies. IMPORTS’ internal benefits include improved user interface, data management, and communication systems that increase productivity. 
KEY CUSTOMERS/STAKEHOLDERS - Hundreds of people in ORA and nearly all FDA business units benefit from capabilities enabled by this investment. Key federal stakeholders include various agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that interact with FDA. Also, the imports business community and the public as a whole benefit from efficient FDA processes.","009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","IMPORTS benefits the public by enabling import functions that ensure product safety in the supply chain.

IMPORTS’ internal benefits include improved user interface, data management, and communication systems that increase productivity.

The benefits for enhanced Imports set of applications are the resulting cost avoidance by the ORA staff being more efficient in executing their tasks.  This results in each employee able to carry out more inspections, import entry review of exceptions, etc.  Examples of this are: 1. Reduced time spent on tracking compliance actions & holds.  2. The system targeting shipments to inspect.  3. Reduced time spent on filed inspection/investigation and label exams, and sample collection administrative tasks.  4. Industry Help Desk efficiency.  5. Entry review integration to the Compliance Management System.  6. The expansion of self-service by the imports industry to check information on inspection status.
These six benefits are estimated to exceed $35M per year in cost avoidance to ORA staff and Industry/Trade participants.","a. Legislative Mandate - Yes. The Bioterrorism Act (BTA) of 2002 in Section 307 requires prior notice for imported food shipments. The BTA and subsequent regulations require that FDA process such food shipments with prior notice (801(m) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) on a 24x7 basis. FDA is required to provide support for this processing 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This has resulted in technical solutions to support this requirement, which is not typical of FDA systems. The Food Safety and Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011 includes Section 110 Building Domestic Capacity. This requires a technical solution for interfacing with external partners. Section 110(d) specifically refers to information technology to enable the requirements of Section 110.

The language delineating the ESRD QIP requirements can be found in Section 1881(h) of the Social Security Act (SSA).

CROWNWeb is a Web-based data-collection system that is mandated by CMS to enable dialysis facilities to meet Section 494.180(h) of the 2008 updated Conditions for Coverage for ESRD Dialysis Facilities, which calls for the electronic submission of administrative and clinical data by all Medicare-certified dialysis facilities in the United States. The system is designed to help the renal community receive more complete and accurate data about dialysis patients, and is used to collect clinical performance measures data from dialysis facilities. CROWNWeb helps the renal community transition from a historic paper-based data-collection method to an electronic “always on” format. The system is designed to help improve patient care efforts by improving the time it takes CMS to produce clinical performance reports because the system reduces the time it takes the agency to collect and analyze facilities’ reported clinical data.

In an effort to promote quality of care, CMS has been collecting performance data from dialysis facilities to support quality reporting programs. This data collection has been mandatory for dialysis facilities through conditions of coverage. The measures are generally designed to be aggregates of patient-level clinical data by provider. CMS has published annually each participating provider’s performance on each measure or measure rates for public consumption.

Project goals and objective align with larger mission delivery goals and objectives of the DHS Strategic Plan, Mission Area 5: Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience: meeting objectives defined by Goal 5.1: Enhance National Preparedness, Goal 5.2: Mitigate Hazards and Vulnerabilities; Goal 5.3 Ensure Effective Emergency Response; and Goal 5.4 Enable Rapid Recovery. The GMM Program is in the Obtain phase of the DHS Acquisition Lifecycle Framework (ALF) and the Requirements Definition Phase of the Systems Engineering Life Cycle (SELC). The anticipated benefits derived include: creating streamlined, integrated, and end-to-end grants management business processes and workflows; establishing a unified, common and consolidated grants management lifecycle for all grants management programs; creating a single automated Grants Management System (GMS) solution and platform for ensuring consistent grants management across the FEMA grants management business domain.  GMM stakeholders are: the public - comprised of the general media and any individuals interested in FEMA grants although not directly impacted by the GMM program; grant users – consisting of grant recipients and sub-recipients, system owners, program managers, and various other individuals involved in the grants life cycle, both external stakeholders (non-Federal entities) and internal stakeholders (those serving in a governmental capacity); external leadership: including Congressional, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Executive Office of the President, and various state, local, tribal, and territorial oversight boards. The program’s customers include: Federal PMs, grants personnel, State Administrative Agents, & individual grant applicants/recipients. Beneficiaries are: U.S. citizens/communities; private/nonprofit sectors, faith/community-based organizations; federal, state, local, tribal, & territorial first responders and partners.","024SO18227 - Not Available","The GMM Program Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) determined that the GMM Program Hybrid Alternative would produce a 325% Return-on-Investment (ROI) and a Net Present Value (NPV) of $171,381 Million (over five years), indicative of producing “favorable yields (i.e., cost savings) in the out-years of the program’s lifecycle. Derived benefits include: (Internal) improved grants oversight and management, workforce efficiencies due to streamlined and consistent business processes, consistent and improved interfaces with FEMA financial management system, and improved audit capabilities due to consolidation of the ten legacy Grants Management Systems (GMSs) into a single system. (External) FEMA external customers will experience improved timeliness and consistent interaction with FEMA grants management programs, an enhanced assistance lifecycle experience, prompt and efficient access to Federal disaster assistance, as well as information regarding assistance available from State and local government and private sector sources, improved timeliness of funding to support survivors designed to proactively improve, strengthen and facilitate community resiliency; improved allocation, tracking, monitoring and reconciliation of grant funds across the emergency management community. Outcomes planned: reduced Grants system sustainment, enhancements, and project management costs; reduced time spent on administrative tasks; consolidated business processes; standardized policies; ability to track and audit Grants; increased management/oversight of grants; increased data availability supporting program decisions; enhance National Preparedness; strengthened service delivery and managed DHS resources; improved FEMA’s financial and grants management systems; connected citizens and employees with the information they need and increased transparency and accessibility of data.","The 2014 -2015 FEMA IT Resiliency Review and multiple audits and findings, and the current grant mgmt. environment created a challenge to FEMA's ability to operate efficiently and effectively; to adapt to changing policies, business practices, and the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape in a cost effective way as defined in Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 2001, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. Additionally, the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and other organizations have conducted hundreds of audits and some 80 studies between 2009 and 2014 that reveal common deficiencies in the current operation of grants programs. Findings from OIG audits from 2010 to 2014 show 10 common themes occurred at least 20 times over the five-years analyzed.

It achieved Acquisition Decision Events (ADE) 2A and 2B in May 2017 and moved into the Obtain phase of the Acquisition Lifecycle Framework. The program developed several prototypes and one pilot effort over the next several months, and is now continuing its data analysis in preparation for bringing its Agile development contractor on board. That contract award took longer than originally projected and caused the program to expend additional funds on its pilot effort, which serves as development increment 1. 
The award has been protested; the protest will delay development beyond increment 1 until sometime in Q2 or possibly Q3 FY19. With reference to funding, the GMM program has determined it is not funded well enough to meet its planned development requirements in FY19 and beyond. In order to meet its Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) requirement for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in FY20, the program estimates it will need additional investment funding through at least FY20 and sustainment funding throughout the lifecycle. The program life cycle cost estimate (LCCE) is under revision now so the final estimate is not complete. 
There is high cost risk for the program, but the GMM sustainment costs are projected to be less than the legacy grants management systems, so FEMA expects to realize some savings in sustainment over the long term. Because of the funding issue, though, the program declared an anticipatory cost breach in September 2018 and will rebaseline its APB cost parameters once the final estimate is completed later this calendar year. If the GMM program does not get additional funding for development and sustainment in the next few years, there is high risk that the program could also experience a schedule breach. 
The GMM program office has significant staffing shortfalls. It is mitigating some of the staffing gaps with the help of DHS Digital Service, who is providing full-time support as GMM hiring actions continue to move through the process. GMM continues to manage governance through its bi-weekly Agile Integrated Product Team meetings co-chaired with another FEMA Agile program, periodic Executive Steering Group meetings (most recently on July 16, 2018), semi-annual ARB appearances, and Executive Steering Committee meetings (most recently on May 24, 2018) that focus on DHS financial modernization programs.",Red,2,"2019-02-28 15:45:06","2019-02-28 15:45:06",5,"2018-09-20 01:14:02","2019-02-08 19:59:19","2019-02-08 19:59:19","Update Required","2018-09-20 01:14:02",,2020,"2016-11-14 16:56:24","2019-03-28 21:14:16","2016-11-14 16:56:24"

GSA Conexus will provide greater value to our customers by improving service delivery in three key areas: 

1) Ordering and inventory management
2) Billing, payment, and dispute management 
3) Data analysis/business intelligence, and reporting

The goal is to consolidate NSP systems functionality into one central system.  Currently under Networx, vendors provide portals, invoice data, and contract deliverables in multiple different methods and formats. Agencies currently go to multiple different vendor portals to manage inventory, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), billing disputes, and other Contract Data Requirement Lists (CDRLs). 

EMORRIS consolidates all Networx vendors billing data into one portal in a single format. This consolidation has shown to save the government money by not duplicating this effort in every agency. This includes the ongoing data format changes and maintenance throughout the life of the contract. We have found that agencies rely heavily on this consolidated data to manage their vendor billing and re-bill internally thereby improving efficiency. 

This investment is to create a revolutionary GSA portal for agencies and GSA personnel, while automating processes and data exchanges that are currently manual. The portal will capture all contract deliverables, billing, and inventory. Data will be accessible to agencies in a consolidated manner, with automation on SLA compliancy and credits as well as vendor invoice dispute management. 

Most importantly, the system is needed to support envisioned Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) operations. EIS is the planned successor to the Networx contracts, with forecast business volume exceeding $2B/year.","023SO18145 - Make it easier to do business with the Government by simplifying processes and streamlining access for our customers and suppliers.","GSA can retain and expand its network services business with the Agencies by:

1.	Providing agencies with a consolidated telecom management portal that will provide service life cycle operations and SLA management
2.	Improving manual ordering and updates in systems to reduce cost and errors, while improving efficiency
3.	Decreasing paper/manual invoicing 
4.	Improving the dispute management tracking process 
5.	Providing timely business information and analysis

To achieve a consolidated telecom management portal requires reengineering GSA s NSP systems. Currently, customers and GSA support teams go into multiple systems to obtain pricing, place orders, and manage their inventory/billing. Listed below are some of the systems utilized today:

~ Telecommunications Ordering and Pricing System (TOPS)
~ TOPS Electronic Billing (e*Bill)
~ Enhanced Monthly On-Line Records and Reports of Information Technology Services (EMORRIS)
~ Networx Inventory Management (NIM)
~ Vendor portals
~ Microsoft Excel, paper records, email

Additionally, customers and GSA perform extensive manual analytics and audits that require many man-hours. A consolidated system will focus on systematic processing to eliminate or reduce these manual efforts, resulting in cost savings, improved customer service, and increased efficiency and accuracy.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, none of these systems were designed to support Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS), the planned successor to the Networx contracts, with forecast business volume exceeding $2B/year. GSA Conexus will mitigate the need for extensive and costly modifications to existing systems.","Published Agency Strategic Plan/Annual Performance Plan http://www.gsa.gov/portal/mediaId/208071/fileName/Annual_Performance_Plan_and_Report_final_2016_Feb2.action.",yes,yes,yes,Conexus.gsa.gov,,"Loren C Smith","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",20.069000,10.318000,8.243000,6.402000,2016,2035,"Significant change as this is a new project.","1 - continue as is",3,"The performance of this major IT investment is monitored as part of the Agency's monthly investment control review.

The WIOA legislation replaced the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and is designed to help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in the labor market and match employers with the skilled workers that they need to compete in the global economy.

In an effort to better measure the legislation's effectiveness and performance, WIOA created new performance measures to capture program success. These measures required the definition of new data elements and that ETA have a new Performance Reporting System in place to accept the first quarter of WIOA data based on the WIOA Information Collection Requests (ICRs) published through OMB. 

The purpose of the Workforce Integrated Performance System (WIPS) investment is to achieve the WIOA legislation's goals of more effective reporting by the deadlines appointed by Congress and meet the requirements outlined in WIOA. The system allows 14 different Employment and Training Administration programs to submit data through the same system and include business intelligence tools to help programs understand and more effectively act upon their data. WIPS improves upon the legacy WIA EDRVS system by adding the new required reporting fields and addresses several legacy pain points. Specific benefits include faster upload times and displayed statuses, a cloud architecture that can scale rapidly in response to heavy traffic, static reporting, real-time participant data in a business intelligence tool, and streamlined rules to eliminate duplicative inputs. These and other benefits provide an improved user experience, more efficient data storage, more flexible/intuitive reporting for users, and ultimately contribute to the DOL Employment and Training Administration mission delivery function by facilitating compliance with and achievement of the goals of the WIOA legislation.","012APG18027 - Administration: Implement an Enterprise-Wide Shared Services Model","This investment fulfills ETA's Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requirements. The update to WIOA was mandatory and ETA had no choice to but to make the update to the system. The WIPS Investment provides many benefits, both internally to the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and externally to the general public. The WIPS Investment was the first enterprise cloud-based system leveraging a commercial cloud hosting vendor within the ETA, complies with OMB's cloud-first policy, and enables DOL to collect and process all of the data required by the WIOA legislation. WIPS allows 14 DOL Programs to upload 100MB files in a mere 1-2 minutes (compared to days with the legacy system) into one single system, provides various reporting capabilities to end users and DOL ETA, and processes entire reports 10x more quickly than the legacy system. The scalable and elastic cloud-based system addresses peak utilization concerns and saved ETA from spending significant financial resources building an in-house data center and then maintaining that data center across its life cycle.","Given tight timeframes, the initial development of the WIPS system focused on the system back-end and not on user-experience. The target state of WIPS will continue to enhance User Interface/User Experience features to provide a better overall experience to end-users that is on par with general industry standards as user feedback is received. Reporting is currently available within WIPS, but provides some and not all program-specific reports. With program-specific reporting for all core programs being implemented in the March release, the target state will include reporting for discretionary programs. The target state of WIPS will continue improving Tableau reporting capabilities, which will allow WIPS end-users and DOL Programs to better analyze, understand, and visualize their data. As these more immediate activities are executed, WIPS can focus on enhancements such as sampling models, sanctioning, and financial data integration. Incorporating these elements can achieve the target state (at this time) of the WIPS System 

Conducting these activities on WIPS will improve the WIPS Investment's ability to 1) carry out DOL's strategic goal of preparing workers for better jobs, 2) fulfill the mission statement of contributing to the more efficient functioning of the U.S. labor market by providing high quality job training, employment, labor market information, and income maintenance services, and 3) allow DOL to comply with all legislative mandates of WIOA.",no,no,no,https://www.doleta.gov/wioa/,,"Raghavan, Sundarrajan","7 - No certification, but with 4 or more years PM experience (within the last five years)",11.236000,4.500000,4.800000,4.800000,2016,2026,"No significant changes","1 - continue as is",3,"Continued development of WIPS is within cost and schedule thresholds and risks are being managed.

CDCIS will provide a cloud-based, more robust solution that centralizes and standardizes the data collection needs of approximately 171 offices using fewer man hours.
eForms, a system designed primarily for printing and wet signatures that uses antiquated, unsustainable technology, manages more than 600 forms spanning across the Department for multiple business administration functions such as requesting a new user account, obtaining approval to take leave, receiving a badge, requesting petty cash, and electing annual benefits. The use of eForms and other disparate BPM tools results in redundant data collection, lack of integration across business processes, a lack of enterprise visibility, and an inconsistent customer experience.  The Department’s data integration needs have exceeded the current system’s capacity; and it is unable to support the data driven capabilities required by the Department’s workforce to enable more informed and effective decisions.
CDCIS leverages ServiceNow, an industry leading BPM software platform, to retire the legacy eForms system. By developing a common platform that leverages an enterprise licensing model, the Department can reduce the cost of disparate licenses and eliminate redundant development efforts. Centralization will also reduce duplicate data entry by bureaus within the Department and increase visibility to enable greater data-driven insights. Another potential benefit is enhanced unified system security through management of a single certified system that meets guidelines and regulations for sensitive and personal information collected on the unclassified system.","014SO18083 - Strengthen U.S. border security and protect U.S. citizens abroad, 014SO18086 - Advance U.S. economic security by ensuring energy security, combating corruption, and promoting market-oriented economic and governance reforms, 014SO18092 - Provide modern and secure infrastructure and operational capabilities to support effective diplomacy and development","Benefits expected through CDCIS and the investment in ServiceNow include: 
• The replacement of the eForms system directly supports the Department’s compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, including the Privacy Act (PA), Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), and the E-Gov Act. It also minimizes effort and cost burden to the Department by eliminating redundancies using a more secure platform. 
• CDCIS will include advanced automated workflows, and electronic signatures that will enhance the Department’s paperless environmental footprint for greater efficiency.
• The shared service model for the acquisition of the ServiceNow licenses supports the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and directly conforms to OMB Memorandum M-16-12 through the consolidation of licenses of approximately five (5) contracts for over 100,000 users across the Department.
• Decreasing duplicative development efforts and increasing reusable functions through collaboration and knowledge sharing across bureaus, by developing scalable teams and processes to enable the CDCIS program to provide development and maintenance services to the full Department at a lower cost.
• CDCIS will significantly decrease time spent responding to data calls and other ad hoc reporting calls because all data is stored in the system in a standard format.  Users will also have increased visibility into the status of processes, reducing time spent tracking down requests. 
• The solution will support the Department’s Cloud first policy to provide increased efficiency, agility and innovation across the agency. The hybrid approach will leverage the Cloud to enable a flexible on premise solution to meet the required timeline. The on premise instance will be used for production in order to comply with the Department’s regulations and Cloud policy.","The Office of Directives Management (DIR) is responsible for managing the collection of all information across the Department and/or to the public. Consistent with the PRA, the Department is tasked with taking meaningful steps to reduce paperwork and reporting burdens. However, DIR observed an increasing number of violations against this objective over the last few years in the current legacy eForms. An advanced technological solution like CDCIS will help the Department improve its compliance with the PRA by reducing the need for Department personnel to pursue inefficient stop/gap measures to satisfy evolving needs not met by the existing eForms solution. 
Additionally, CDCIS supports the automation of processes and service management.  CDCIS will enable Department personnel to not only provide but also process information electronically, in alignment with the and the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA)’s direction to use electronic forms, electronic filing, and electronic signatures to conduct official business when possible and to provide enhanced access to Government information and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding protection of personal privacy, national security, and records retention noted in the E Government Act of 2002.
CDCIS helps satisfy the responsibility of the Federal Government, per Executive Order 13571, to streamline service delivery and to apply best practices to deliver services better, faster and at a lower cost.

AFES is a comprehensive, holistic technical solution for countering fraud in programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  It will provide a technical platform for the Social Security Administration to detect, respond to, discover and recover from possible fraud.  The implementation of the full solution will improve SSA s detection of fraud and streamline the investigation and recovery efforts.  The purpose of the Anti-Fraud Enterprise Solution (AFES) investment is to implement an SSA enterprise system, which encompasses (1) a Data Analytics Engine to automate, streamline, enhance, and centralize the agency's anti-fraud data analytic processes, (2) an Incident Management System, which will implement a unified incident management process to identify events of incident/vulnerabilities within our programs, (3) a Workflow Management Tool, which will centralize the structure of our anti-fraud activities and initiatives into a single process, (4) a Messaging System, which will communicate with other systems within the SSA environment, providing a common interface for systems to interact programmatically with AFES (5) a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution for agency components to collect and analyze instances of detected fraud for real-time monitoring of fraud trends, and (6) a simplified interface for employees and other internal users to report potential fraud and refer these allegations for appropriate action and to the SSA Office of the Inspector General.

ARIS will provide a means for SSA employees and Disability Determination Services employees to develop and refer allegations of potential violations involving SSA programs and operations to the Office of Inspector General. Implementing ARIS will replace the current e8551 allegation referral process by re-engineering how fraud allegations are reported to OIG and SSA s analytics components.  The new process will enhance SSA s ability to identify interrelated claims and high-risk transactions across our programs and better positions SSA to comply with government wide anti-fraud mandates for federal agencies.","016SO18201 - Enhance Fraud Prevention and Detection Activities","AFES Quantitative Benefits
OAFP is developing a methodology for calculating savings and avoided losses which will be reviewed by the Office of the Actuary. While the methodology is being developed, we can make some reasonable estimates for projected quantifiable benefits attributed to our plan to expand AFES into the Disability Insurance (DI) line of business.  There was roughly $146B in DI payments in 2016.  If we assume that even 1% of those payments are likely fraudulent, and that AFES can assist with recovering or preventing 10% of those potentially fraudulent payments, then the AFES investment in the DI arena would provide a $146M annual benefit towards our anti-fraud efforts. When agency agreement on how to calculate anti-fraud metrics is reached, we will use the AFES BI architecture to develop regular reporting upon those metrics.

AFES Qualitative Benefits
- Lessen financial impact on the Trust Funds/SSI outlays and customer time spent resolving potential fraud through incorporating additional lines of business such as the Disability and SSI workloads.  
- Decrease the amount of remediation time by shortening the length of time it takes to discover and correct payments that are not going to the correct individual.
- Reduce employee support/work time by enabling streamlined operation and enhanced automation of key system functions; such as data loading, case/workflow management, messaging between systems, and reporting.
- Reduce maintenance costs by eliminating redundant fraud detection systems and avoiding development of new single-purpose systems.
- Create encompassing reports with greater expediency and efficiency due to utilizing an embedded reporting engine, which can integrate with other BI reporting tools.
- Improve control and responsiveness to changes in fraud patterns, trends, and threats due to a streamlined model tuning and production lifecycle.
- Facilitate data-driven fraud investment, operational, and management decisions using advanced analytics capabilities. We anticipate that AFES will be a key provider of management information on the performance of mitigation strategies for two new workgroups, the Anti-Fraud Activities Interim Management Information workgroup, and the Fraud Risk Assessments workgroup.
- Improve auditability, tracking, and management of SSAs enterprise fraud operations and business processes.
- Discourage the perpetration of fraud against SSA programs through the increased detection of potential fraud.
ARIS Qualitative Benefits
- The allegation referral process will be simplified and enhanced to increase the quality of the finished allegation report for OIG and for SSA s analytic components.
- The development portion of the referral process will be precise and ARIS will aid the user in accurately describing the events of the referral. It will generate only questions and answers pertinent to the type of the referral with logical sequencing.
- The user interface will support allegation searches by specific content such as fields, timeframes, and freeform text identifiers.
- Allow users to view the statuses of their referrals from initial submission through the outcome.
- Allow users to report all programmatic and internal fraud allegations to OIG and streamline the allegations referral process.
- Streamline the allegation referral process.
- Deliver a configurable process capable of adapting to changing business needs and an ever-evolving fraud environment.","This investment partially addresses the following legislative mandates: Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 [https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ186/PLAW-114publ186.pdf]; Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 (Division N, Title II, Subtitle B of Consolidated Appropriations, 2016) [https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ113/PLAW-114publ113.pdf] and Information Security [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s2521enr/pdf/BILLS-113s2521enr.pdf]

The agency will better serve the public with a modern technology foundation that eliminates legacy systems, reduces reliance on old mainframe architectures, employs agile development, and makes us nimbler.  SSA s IT plays a critical role in support of the agency s mission, ensuring access to information when and how the public needs it, and upholding the protection of personal information. We view modernization as a vital means to fulfill our commitment to the citizens who rely on SSA services.

We will create a modern technology platform where we build streamlined workflow systems that take advantage of innovations by our business partners.  We will use modular construction and agile development methods so that our systems can share common elements, making development of our software faster and more responsive. We will implement automation and tools enabling us to test software early, so the quality produced will be higher when released to the end users.  Automation and new computing environments, like the cloud, will enable us to release new software much faster when we release new legacy code on the mainframe. Our new architecture will be modular and based on compact services -  chunks of functionality that can be deployed efficiently and reused across many systems. 

Modernized systems will enable a person to work through a single entry point for all our programs. We plan to implement artificial intelligence systems to help us streamline our workloads. Further, we will develop the capability to use advanced analytics to better utilize electronic medical evidence we receive. We will continue to improve and expand online interactions. We will bring more of our services behind our secure portal, so if a person wants to do business with us, they will come in through the same site with all options available to them.  Because our data will be aligned based on who the person is and the ways in which they interact with us, our systems will better determine if we have all the information we need to complete the interaction. If not, we will automatically ask for it. This saves the inconvenience of being contacted again, speeds the required response, and saves everyone time. We want our internet options to become the option of choice for most people.","016SO18199 - Accelerate Information Technology Modernization","SSA s IT Modernization program benefits include:
1. Improve Service to the Public though increasing online self-service, real-time processing and moving towards a more service-centric organization and technical structure.
2. Increase Value of IT for Business by increasing IT and data reliability, security and enabling faster disability claim decisions.
3. Improve IT Workforce Engagement by enabling a quicker path to fielding new capabilities, modernizing development environment to improve productivity, and building a culture to attract and retain top technology talent.
4. Improve Business Workforce Engagement by enabling better service with enhanced user-centric tools and the ability to move routine work through the systems quickly, enabling our workforce to focus more on the most challenging service needs.
5. Reduce IT and other Operating Costs through expanding shared services and the cloud, increasing benefits available through disciplined approaches and reuse of components, and encouraging innovation to improve operational efficiency.
6. Reduce Risk to Continuity of Operations by increasing awareness of cyber threats and capacity to defend against these threats.

Our return on investment for the IT Modernization initiative is based on efficiency estimates gained by similar entities after modernization completion. We worked with leading research firms to determine the following ranges of cost efficiencies achievable over time. Data cost efficiencies range from 10% to 25%. Applications cost efficiencies range from 10% to 30%. Infrastructure cost efficiencies range from 10% to 30%. Given that ranges are similar among the three measured areas; we can assume they hold true when combined. Efficiencies are incrementally gained as legacy applications within the business domains are retired, and are assumed to increase over time as more experience is gained and more applications become modernized. We ve assumed 10% efficiency gained in the first year benefits are realized, 15% in the following two years, and 20% thereafter. Applying these results to the portion of our annual IT spend affected by modernization efforts results in a positive ROI of about 12%.","OMB, Congress and the White House recognize the critical need for IT modernization in Federal Government.

The purpose of this project is to implement the procured solution to modernize and replace the legacy USMS mission systems. As part of preparation for a next generation system, the USMS evaluated 170 business processes in four lines of business. The new system will become the agency s business process automation platform allowing USMS to optimize processes handled by legacy systems and automate labor-intensive manual processes.  The requirement to support mobile devices will push data out, allowing USMS operators to be more effective in finding fugitives, protecting the judiciary, managing prisoners, and conducting other USMS missions. Capture s primary external stakeholders are the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BoP), District of Columbia Department of Corrections (DOC), District of Columbia Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), United States Probation Office (USPO), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS) and its systems: National Crime Information Center (NCIC), National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS), and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS).","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime","The USMS expects to see the following outcomes as a result of the Mission Modernization investment: 
 	Booking Efficiencies: Reduce initial print requirements from 14 individual to 2 four-finger slaps allowing more rapid ID to pull data from JABS and IAFIS saving 6 minutes per booking and reducing duplicate data entry. Improves officer safety in cell block - inmate restrained during 4 finger slap. Annual Savings in hours: 194,792
 	Data Sharing & Integrity: Import criminal history from NCIC and Federal Court data from CM/ECF to eliminate duplicative data entry and promote data consistency between federal database.  Annual Savings in hours: 47,007
 	Document Management: Paper-based documents will be captured and stored electronically and made available to mobile users. OCR capability will permit direct ingest of data into the system. Annual Savings in hours: 10,400-20,800 range
 	Automated Scheduling: Data exchange with U.S. Courts will automate today's manual prisoner scheduling process and provide more accurate, longer range schedules than currently possible. Annual Savings in hours: 235,752
 	Mobile Arrest Package: Initiates booking immediately upon arrest by allowing mobile users to capture fingerprints, photographs, record location, identify victims, and initiate medical/property/investigative/tort claim documents. Annual Savings in hours: 52,000
 	Warrant Data Validation: Business rules for fugitive warrants will enforce compliance with NCIC standards reducing risk of incomplete submissions and more clearly identifying fields requiring further investigations by USMS. Annual Savings in hours: 15,950.","Mission Modernization will be compliant with all applicable requirements to include:

CWF has four quarterly releases that control, implement, and update software changes due to legislative mandates.  Software changes for the claims processing operations are managed in quarterly releases developed through a change control process that begins with the Medicare Change Control Board (MCCB) review and prioritization of pending requests.  The FFS Operations Board approves the quarterly releases with oversight by the FFS Governance Council and manages/integrates day-to-day operations of the FFS program across CMS.  The FFS claims processing environment is distributed across four (4) claims processing modules and one (1) integrated testing module.

Each MAC within the sector is linked to its CWF Host via telecommunications through their respective CMS Virtual Data Center (VDC). 

Each Medicare Part A, B and DME processing region creates a nightly CWF file containing claims data. The corresponding MAC’s VDC transmits these files to the CWF Host.  The CWF Host uses the CWF software to determine the beneficiary's eligibility and entitlement status and then uses that information to decide what action should be taken on the claim.  The CWF software also checks incoming claims against all other claims types, referred to as A/B crossover, previously processed and stored in claims history to prevent duplicate payments. Prior to adjudication of claims, current claims are sent to the Fraud Prevention System (FPS), to evaluate for fraudulent activity. The claims will process through the FPS system and FPS will send back only denials, if any, to the CWF Hosts the next day. The CWF Host returns a response file back to the VDC and the file is loaded to the MACs processing region. The file will contain various disposition codes, trailers, and error codes, used by the processing systems in automatic processing during the batch cycle.The responses are applied to the pending claim allowing appropriate system action.

Within the larger context of CMS’ business, the CWF is a mission critical system now supporting over one billion claims annually and continues to grow. In following the CMS Investment Lifecycle, CWF has four scheduled (January, April, July and October) quarterly releases per year which typically include 30-40 Change Requests (CRs) along with operational problem fixes. Off-quarter releases are also delivered at the direction of CMS for Emergency, Special and Priority needs. These releases support the entire Medicare claims processing community.

 

Software changes for the claims processing operations are managed in quarterly releases developed through a change control process that begins with the Medicare Change Control Board (MCCB) review and prioritization of pending change requests.  The FFS Operations Board approves the quarterly releases with oversight by the FFS Governance Council and manages/integrates day-to-day operations of the FFS program across CMS.  The goal of the FFS Operations Board is to implement error-free releases that implement legislative mandates with minimal interruption to processing ensure that beneficiaries receive the correct service and providers receive the correct payment.

CMS began transitioning PSCs and ZPICs to Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPICs) in 2016. As a result, CMS and the PI Contractors were able to share best practices across UPIC-referred overpayments, identify strategies to increase MAC’s collection of UPIC-referred overpayments, work with the MACs to create a standard report format both for overpayment referral reports and overpayment collection reports, and institute the use of a unique identifier for each overpayment. The UCM system consolidated several individual PSC and ZPIC systems into one centrally located system which CMS oversees and manages, which improved and enhanced the management and oversight of the PI contractors, resulting in benefits across all areas of PI. This enhancement provides direct and transparent access to the program integrity workflow, as well as promotes coordination and efficiency across the lifecycle of a case.  The project implemented the functionality of the UCM system by analyzing and reviewing current systems used by CMS contractors and migrated functionality and data into UCM.   Several information management systems supported CMS PI activities by tracking investigations and the workload of PI contractors who investigate allegations of suspected fraud, waste, or abuse (FWA). Prior to the UCM, a number of PI contractors maintained their own standalone proprietary case tracking systems to track their workload and produce reports. There were also two CMS-owned/contractor-operated systems—Fraud Investigation Database (FID) and the Work Flow Management System (WFMS).   Through the implementation of UCM, CMS has been successfully able to limit the use and oversight for FWA activities to a single system.   The Department of Health and Human Services and The Department of Justice Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2017, published in April 2018 describes each of the programs that are contributing to fraud recovery.","Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010.  The Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law on March 23, 2010, provided the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) with critical tools to implement important strategic changes in pursuing fraud, waste, and abuse.

The purpose of this Investment is to serve as a roadmap for procuring the products and services needed to implement the new Medicare cards. Specifically, CMS will accomplish the following: Remove SSN-based HICN from Medicare cards and replace with a new MBI; Provide a solution to our federal and business partners that allows usage of HICN and/or MBI for business critical data exchanges; Minimize disruption to Medicare operations; Minimize burden for beneficiaries; Minimize burden for providers; Provide outreach, education, and support to our partners, providers and beneficiaries to ensure smooth transition to the new cards; Distribute new Medicare cards with a new MBI displayed.","009SO18220 - Ensure responsible financial management","The purpose of the New Medicare Card Project is to remove the SSN-based Health Insurance Claim Numbers (HICN) from Medicare cards and replace it with a new Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) without adversely impacting existing necessary business functions. This investment required modification to the affected CMS and contractor systems and business processes to accommodate receipt and processing of the new MBI.  Removing HICNs from Medicare cards and making the necessary changes to underlying systems and processes required coordination among federal, state, and private sector stakeholders. New and existing Medicare beneficiaries must receive new Medicare cards with new MBIs by April 2019.  The New Medicare Card Investment is based on existing technology and existing systems.

The solution for New Medicare Card Project provided capabilities to accomplish the following:

ü  Generate MBIs for all beneficiaries – existing, deceased, and new

ü  Generate replacement MBIs for individuals whose identity has been compromised

ü  Issue Medicare cards containing the MBI

ü  Modify systems and business processes to accommodate receipt, transmission, display, and processing of the MBI

 

Changes to systems where the MBI must be received, processed, and converted to HICN, when needed, are driven by interactions with external stakeholders where only the MBI will be used, such as with beneficiaries, providers, and plans. For systems where processing is entirely internal to CMS, with no direct interactions with external stakeholders (i.e., “downstream” systems), the MBI may not be necessary for processing. In these instances, systems may process using the HICN as they do currently, minimizing the system changes that would need to be made and the propagation of the MBI throughout the CMS systems environment. Systems that receive and process the MBI will need to convert the MBI to a HICN to pass transactions to downstream systems that do not process or store the MBI. This approach was by far more efficient, less disruptive, and economical than requiring every system to operate with the new identifier. 

 

Approximately 74 CMS systems were impacted by the new Medicare Beneficiary Identifier.  Some of these systems underwent significant changes while others were fairly simple and straight forward (such as adding the a new field to capture, store and transmit the new MBI).  Thru FY18, CMS implemented a total of 250 system changes throughout these 74 systems ensuring that all Medicare and Medicaid operations are able to operate with the new MBI starting 04/01/18. 

 

To mitigate impacts to CMS business processes and external stakeholders, the New Medicare Card Project will have a transition period following the initial assignment of MBIs that coincides with the initial mailing of new Medicare cards for existing active beneficiaries. During the transition period (04/01/18 – 12/31/19), CMS will accept either the HICN or MBI from all external stakeholders. After the transition period (starting 01/01/20), with some exceptions documented in the New Medicare Card Project program-level business requirements, CMS will only interact with beneficiaries, providers, plans, and other third parties using the MBI.","On April 16, 2015, President Obama signed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015. Section 501 prohibits inclusion of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) on Medicare cards and specifically states that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall establish cost-effective procedures to ensure that a Social Security account number (or derivative thereof) is not displayed, coded, or embedded on the Medicare card issued to an individual who is entitled-to benefits under part A of title XVIII or enrolled under part B of title XVIII and that any other identifier displayed on such card is not identifiable as a Social Security account number (or derivative thereof). The law also states that the Secretary shall provide for the re-issuance of the Medicare cards no later than four years after MACRA enactment.
 
CMS, other federal agencies, and private partners will replace the SSN-based Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) as the primary identifier on Medicare cards to improve and better protect private healthcare and financial information and the payments associated with their federal healthcare benefits and services. This complex, multi-year effort  involves coordination  between federal, state, and private-sector  stakeholders.
Examples of this effort include, but are not limited to, the integration of state Medicaid claims processing; beneficiary eligibility and enrollment processes that span CMS, the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) coordination of benefits, and submissions of claims for more than 1.5 million providers. Integration and rollout of the business process and information technology (IT) system changes must be performed while maintaining continued operations of existing systems to ensure that beneficiaries have access to care and to avoid any disruptions to the payment processes for rendered services.

The eSM Program is focused on HUD s largest program, Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA), which serves 2.2 million households comprised of low income, elderly, disabled and those eligible for other special purpose voucher needs. This program will allow HUD to retire and modernize several older custom built IT systems.  The success of this program will also help support HUD s Rental Housing Assistance (RHA) Line-of-business (LOB), provide timely access to reliable data, enable risk mitigation, and enhance decision making.

Projected outcomes include:
1. Compliance with Office of Inspector General and Department of Treasury requirements by following accounting best practices, business process and data improvements, and technology enablement. The eSM Program will reduce costly administrative burden on Public Housing Authorizes (PHAs) in the collection and reporting of tenant data, Public Housing building and unit inventory data, and Housing Assistance Payment information and enhance HUD's oversight capabilities resulting in more effective support of PHA's housing voucher administration.
2. Integrated solution through business process automation, analytics, and enterprise reporting reducing up to $150 million in excess reserves held by the PHA
3.Technology scalability and cost management by upgrading financial and programmatic management functions and systems to technologies like Cloud Services for increased scalability, flexible cost structures, and seamless upgrades
4. Support reduction in legacy system dependencies by working with OCIO and OCFO to establish a roadmap to modernize,replace, and/or consolidate existing systems into enterprise solutions that  automate current manual processes, increase overall efficiencies, and mitigate end-of-life concerns over key legacy systems. 

Primary customers and beneficiaries of the EVMS Program include the more than 2.2 million households served by TBRA and the more than 2,300 PHAs across the country. Internal major stakeholders and beneficiaries for HUD include the Office of Public and Indian Housing, Multifamily Housing, Offices of the Chief Information Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. External stakeholders include OMB, GAO, Congress, as well as Housing industry and advocate groups.","025SO18061 - Strengthen fiscal responsibility and controls","Business and IT Benefits include: 
1.Better use of funding and compliance: 
- Reduced workload and associated costs and time for external stakeholders by 50%. 
- Reduced maintenance costs achieved by retiring existing systems that are at end-of-life.
- Improved data stewardship practices and funds management and control.
- Increased efficiencies from improved data integrity and more efficient system performance 
- Future costs avoided by reducing probability of costly system failure due to dependence on aging systems and infrastructure.
- Reduce/recover approximately as much as $150 million of PHA-held reserves offset by HUD annually.
- Elimination of Material Weaknesses and audit findings by improving business processes and data stewardship.
- Reduce error handling and submission error rates by as much as 50% to lessen burden on the PHAs and enabling HUD staff time to analyze portfolios and perform fraud recovery. 
-More accurate budget projections to reduce the amount of excess funds provided to PHAs, saving an estimated $ 200 million annually for new families or reallocation in future budgets.

2.Streamline business processes:
-Reduce hours PHAs spend correcting submission error rates by as much as 50%, achieved through process redesign and automation
-Enable HUD staff to allocate more time to analyzing portfolios and perform PHA fraud recovery support and oversight
-End-to-end traceability, transparency and auditability of HCV Program disbursements to address four material weaknesses and five significant deficiencies
-Improve data stewardship practices and funds management 
-Increase efficiencies from improved data integrity and more efficient system performance

3.Enhance IT Capabilities:
- Use Service Oriented Architecture framework which provides for standardized and re-usable application components thereby reducing customization and boutique processes, and also enables rapid responses to changing requirements
-Estimated 25% reduction in operations and maintenance costs related to the HCV program achieved through decommissioning VMS
-Increase flexibility of system which will allow for program calculation adjustments to be made more quickly and affordably.
-Increase compliance and efficiency by integrating with real near time interface with financial system of record, Oracle Federal Financials.","Primary drivers for change are material weaknesses and significant deficiencies as outlined below. The eSM Program will eliminate key findings and material weaknesses  by focusing on expanding on the data collected, improving the method for calculating and disbursing funds, creating business intelligence reports and improving workflows.  The FY 2015 Agency Financial Report cited nine key management and performance challenges facing the Department: financial management governance of HUD, Financial management (mgmt.) systems, and Public and assisted program administration.
The FY16 Agency Financial Report cited the Rental Assistance Voucher Program with several Material Weaknesses and Significant Deficiencies: 
-Cash Mgmt: Inadequately accounted for assets and liabilities resulting from PIH's cash management processes
-Financial Reporting: lack of adequate financial mgmt systems to ensure accurate and reliable financial reporting; inability to modernize legacy systems and lack of integration causing reliance on manual processes 
-Internal Controls: deficiency in the control environments and HUD s internal controls over PIH cash management processes remain weak
-Noncompliance with FFMIA and Treasury Financial rules on Cash Management with Public Housing Agencies and Improper Payments Elimination

During the Planning Phase, the eVMS Project developed a Proof of Concept (POC) for the Housing Choice Voucher cash management and budget formulation processes that focused on iterative development, data analysis and PHA Housing Assistance Program Register data to demonstrate the feasibility of transforming the method for calculating and disbursing funds to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs). 

The Proof of Concept efforts were able to:
-Demonstrate calculation of PHA need at the tenant level to both internal and external stakeholders, including HUD  s industry partners.
- Encourage early PHA collaboration with HUD s business transformation process, and highlights alignment amongst impacted parties, 
- Automate PHA need calculation, traces POC units to specific business requirements, and facilitates flexibility for HUD  s evolving business process
- Demonstrate HUDs ability to accurately calculate PHA need by reconciling HAP registers to the results of the POC.

This results in a lack of standardization data models, software and hardware, business practices, and procurement vehicles - and an expensive and unsustainable operating model. Moving to a centralized Retail Management Suite will enable the National Park Service to manage revenue collection and accounting, customer relationships, serial inventory, loss prevention and theft, workforce planning, analytics and reporting and reduce overhead costs associated with the current Point of Sale models by decreasing inefficiencies through standardization, decreasing maintenance and administrative burdens, and allowing for purchasing economies of scale. 

Alternatives are being analyzed to determine the best approach to improve the business processes and reduce the overhead costs.

 NSF has implemented an enterprise data warehouse, which centralizes and streamlines access to NSF data and enables innovative IT applications and systems that support mission-related activities.  In addition to accessibility to data, the data warehouse supports critical analysis capabilities that inform a variety of essential business functions, including NSF portfolio management, evaluation, and assessment. As the demand for data and data analytics continues to increase within and outside of the Foundation, NSF will leverage this investment to develop a framework to ensure accountability for NSF’s critical business data.
   
 Implementation of a data warehouse at the enterprise level replaced and has helped avoid costs associated with the previous model of implementing separate data warehouses or data marts for individual IT investments. This investment is also central to enabling IT tools to support critical NSF mission activities, and enables NSF to leverage advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to interpret data and make suggestions upon which NSF staff can choose to act or adjust.","422SO18171 - Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations","NSF’s initial investment of $4 million to stand up and populate an enterprise data warehouse, centralized a platform for data access, management and delivery, resulting in direct and meaningful benefit for internal staff by providing broad access to authoritative data and “canned” reporting.  Prior to the investment in a central data warehouse, data marts were being leveraged for use by at least four individual organizations with the Agency, at roughly equivalent cost to NSF’s initial enterprise investment.  These four organizations could not access each other’s data and only had access to data they wished to leverage.  
 
Continuation of this investment has proven key to meeting NSF’s strategic priorities related to data-based decision-making, and has enabled staff to more efficiently conduct work in support of NSF’s mission. For example, access to central, authoritative data helps NSF staff identify areas of science that may be underrepresented or that have gaps in terms of federal funding.  NSF staff can use this data to create reports, which can help them manage or balance their research portfolios. 
 
The Data Management & Delivery investment has matured into the platform through which NSF is deploying advanced technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), into the NSF Merit Review process.  As well, tools provided through this investment enable data analytics and visualization in easy to use interfaces.  All of these capabilities are key to transitioning the agency’s workforce from low-value to high-value work.  This investment will be the nexus for institutionalizing data management practices that allow the agency to share and more readily leverage data to benefit the Agency and the public.","Legislative Mandate –

Specifically, Grants Online is a business workflow system that provides a standardized set of automated processes for viewing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting grants information including, applications, awards, amendments, audits, proposed scoring and commentary, progress and financial reports, as well as technical and panel peer review information. The Grants Online system electronically retrieves grant applications from Grants.gov for processing in the Grants Online system.  It also interfaces with CBS, the Department's financial system of record. The system was designed to be scalable in an effort to accommodate future change and enhancements as the grants management processes and policy change.

NOAA typcially awards approximatley $1 billion in grants annually. In 2005, NOAA deployed Grants Online to its federal staff in an effort to streamline and automate the grants management process. In 2006 Grants Online was rolled out to NOAA's grant recipients for electronic award acceptance and post award management.
 
Starting in FY 2008, the NOAA Grants Management Division (GMD) expanded its usage to other DoC bureaus including the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), the International Trade Administration (ITA), the Department of Commerce (DOC) Office of the Secretary/Office of Human Resources offices, and the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA).  The Economic Development Administration (EDA) began using the system in FY 2014.  The Census Bureau began using the system in FY 2016.  The system has enabled rooms that were previously filled with stuffed file drawers floor to ceiling to be converted into to offices and other more efficient use of space.

Key stakeholders include all those with an interest in the efficient processing of VA appeals. Beyond the obvious stakeholder, that being Veterans, the Veterans Service Organizations, who assist Veterans in pursuing VA appeals, have a significant interest in a modern appeals processing system. Additionally, Congress is a key stakeholder; Congress regularly submits inquiries to VA concerning pending appeals and wait times on those appeals.","029APG18038 - Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act Implementation, 029SO18126 - VA holds its personnel and external service providers accountable for delivering excellent customer service and experiences while eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse","The Appeals Modernization effort will improve and streamline the end-to-end appeals process by increasing efficiency and providing transparency to all stakeholders involved in the multi-step process.  This Board of Veterans Appeals initiative will result in the creation of a new tool, Caseflow, that will replace VACOLS with tools and functionality that are required to more effectively and securely process appeals. The tool will leverage and integrate with existing enterprise assets. Appeals Modernization will improve appeals processing throughout the Department in order to better serve Veterans and their families. In addition, Veterans will be able to initiate appeals and view the status online via the Vets.gov website that will consolidate all Veteran facing services and content to a single website and requires a single username and password. 

Improvements in obtaining appeals status information, appeals hearing scheduling, and the appeals intake process yield a positive return on investments of 14%.  Projected costs are $14,025,190 with Actual Costs at  $3,834,371.  For Appeals Status Information, the # of Veterans affected was 18,537 with a time savings (in hours) of 0.5 with the average cost of Veteran time per hour of $19.49 for a total savings of $180,643.  For Hearing Scheduling, the # of Veterans affected was 16,625 with a time savings (in hours) of 8.0 with the average cost of Veteran time per hour of $19.49 for a total savings of $2,592,170.  For Hearing Intake Process, the # of Veterans affected was 10,453 with a time savings (in hours) of 65 with the average cost of Veteran time per hour of $19.49 for a total savings of $13,242,383.","Caseflow will leverage people, process, and technology enhancements to mitigate risk inherent with disjointed manual appeals processing from multiple business lines.

Interoperability supports the electronic exchange of health information among caregivers and other authorized parties. Clinicians, providers, and their administrative staff can streamline their workflows and increase the breadth of health information available, coordinate care, and streamline transitions of care for Veterans. Improving cross-departmental interoperability and interoperability with industry will provide improved access to a more comprehensive and integrated patient health history from multiple sources where care originally occurred. Veterans will have better options to see private health care providers and be assured that their health information should be available to their VA providers. The Health Registry Program is comprised of several individual registries that coordinate care, track health outcomes, and develop best clinical practices. The registries are used as an organized system for the collection, storage, retrieval, analysis, and dissemination of information on Veterans who have either a particular disease, a condition that predisposes to the occurrences of a health-related event, prior exposure to substances known or suspected to cause adverse health effects, or identify incarcerated Veterans accessing non-VA community homeless programs, so they can be connected to VA services. New development includes the Integrated Registries Platform (VIRP) which will provide each registry's patient data and when integrated with the EHR will offer clinical management using a common data model for staff during patient care. MHV is VA's personal health record portal providing Veterans with tools to empower them to make informed decisions and manage their health needs. MHV is designed for all Veterans, active duty Service members, and their dependents and caregivers. Any Veteran may create a personal health record, access trusted health resources and complete a HealtheLiving Assessment. VA patients with a Premium account can also access key portions of their EHR, communicate electronically with their healthcare team using Secure Messaging, view their VA appointments, refill prescriptions and track their delivery, etc. The VA's Blue Button feature enables Veterans to view, print or download a customized report that includes information from their EHR along with data Veterans have entered into their personal health record.","029SO18121 - VA anticipates veterans' changing needs throughout their lives to enhance their choices, 029SO18122 - veterans are informed of, understand, and can avail themselves of the benefits, care, and services they choose, 029SO18123 - VA has collaborative, high-performing, and integrated delivery networks that enhance veteran well-being and independence, 029SO18124 - VA ensures at-risk and underserved veterans receive what they need to eliminate veteran suicide, homelessness, and poverty, 029SO18125 - VA is always transparent to enhance veterans' choices, to maintain trust, and to be openly accountable for its actions, 029SO18126 - VA holds its personnel and external service providers accountable for delivering excellent customer service and experiences while eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse, 029SO18127 - VA's infrastructure improvements, improved decision-making protocols, and streamlined services enable VA to agilely adapt to changing business environments and veteran needs, 029SO18129 - VA IT modernization will quickly deliver effective solutions that will enable VA to provide improved customer service and provide a secure and seamless experience while decreasing its rate of spend., 029SO18130 - VA will institutionalize data supported and performance focused decision making that will improve the quality of outcomes","All Health Registries are a critical component in monitoring Veterans' health status and planning patient care. The ability to track the Veteran's information allows health providers to ensure accurate and timely solutions that benefit the Veteran population. The existing Registries ROI is illustrated through support to VA's nationally recognized clinical practices that result in lower development and sustainment costs and higher efficiency and effectiveness of treatment. Prior to the Veterans Integrated Platform (VIRP), the nine Registries were being sustained by the Converged Registry Solution. Beginning in April 2019, those nine Registries will be sustained into one Web Portal system within the Veterans Integrated Platform reducing the cost for sustainment by $1,359,340.57 approximately 1% of the previous sustainment contract. Improved interoperability of inter-Departmental health benefit information should expedite administrative and financial decision-making processes; helping to ensure services are made available to Veterans and family members quickly. It also reduces the cost of delivering care due to more efficient communications. Over 30% of Veterans live in rural areas where a visit to the doctor can be a day-long event. Service members transitioning from Active Duty to Veteran status often undertake several moves, seeing multiple care providers toting a bundle of paperwork. My HealtheVet (MHV) offers many online advantages to both groups plus the Veteran population as a whole. ROI is based on cost avoidance/savings for both visits and cost per visit. Assumptions: secure message (SM) volume: SM/year = 15.84M (1.32M/month). RxRefill volume: RxRefill = 19.5M (1.62M/month). Combined total volume/year = approximately 35.34M (2.94M/month). ROI: If 50% of combined SM and RxRefill avoid a visit or contact with treatment at a facility, then approximately 17.67M encounters are avoided. Average cost/visit = $30. Cost avoidance = 17.67M avoided visits * $30 average cost/visit = $530M. O&M costs were $9.4M, making the ROI 56.4 to 1. Quantitative/Qualitative benefits include costs saved by government/Veteran in fewer routine/diagnostic visits; clinicians have more time for non-routine visits; Veterans are empowered by managing their own care and save time by not having to travel to a facility. MHV improves access and perceptions of access, enables more direct communication, and enhances relationships between Veterans and VA healthcare team.","- Requires data collected on service members with significant eye injuries be shared to coordinate benefits and services and requires a Traumatic Brain Injury Registry

Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS) is an interface used by providers, nurses, staff to view patient centric information, the electronic medical record used throughout VA in all health care settings covering all aspects of patient care and treatment. Purchased Care adds system checks and reporting functions to the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) and implements new Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Standards and Operating rules that allow VHA to continue exchanging data with insurance payers and maintain the flow of revenue to VHA. Digital Health Platform provides clinical data services and an application platform for VistA, which integrates Veterans health information from all available VA, DoD and community health partner sources. Telehealth Services support the critical clinical, technological, and administrative infrastructures necessary for VA to successfully deliver this volume of virtual care services to Veterans safely and cost-effectively. Lab modernizes the legacy Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Laboratory application created more than 30 years ago. The solution utilizes a Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) interfaced with VistA to maintain systems integration with the more than 40 applications. For Pharmacy, Pharmacy Re-engineering (PRE) was originally scoped to replace all legacy pharmacy applications with a system to meet current and future VA needs. The legacy applications with mid-80s technology are obsolete and expensive to maintain/enhance. The focus is on critical patient safety issues with legacy systems by providing three clinical decision support tools to crosscheck drugs/doses in medication orders to reduce frequency of adverse drug events and save lives. For Community Care, the Office of Community Care (OCC) was established in 2015 with the goal to deliver a program that is easy to understand, simple to administer, and meets the needs of Veterans and their families, community providers, and VA staff. OCC provides Veterans access to health care by community providers when services are not available at a VA facility, within a clinically appropriate timeframe or when distance makes these services inaccessible.","029APG18039 - Community Care, 029APG18091 - Veteran Customer Experience, 029APG18092 - Veteran Suicide Prevention, 029SO18121 - VA anticipates veterans' changing needs throughout their lives to enhance their choices, 029SO18123 - VA has collaborative, high-performing, and integrated delivery networks that enhance veteran well-being and independence, 029SO18124 - VA ensures at-risk and underserved veterans receive what they need to eliminate veteran suicide, homelessness, and poverty, 029SO18125 - VA is always transparent to enhance veterans' choices, to maintain trust, and to be openly accountable for its actions, 029SO18127 - VA's infrastructure improvements, improved decision-making protocols, and streamlined services enable VA to agilely adapt to changing business environments and veteran needs, 029SO18129 - VA IT modernization will quickly deliver effective solutions that will enable VA to provide improved customer service and provide a secure and seamless experience while decreasing its rate of spend.","Health Management Platform will provide both internal and external benefits. Patient Records will reduce excess costs by reducing unnecessary vaccinations, inventory waste and improve accuracy of patient health records. The Purchased Care program enables data-driven service improvements to accelerate accurate Veteran copayment determination by improving the Veteran experience and ensuring Veterans receive the highest level of coordinated care within VA. Purchased Care assists Veterans with non-service connected conditions and have third party insurance. Purchased Care is able to expedite determination of out of pocket costs through electronic means in a fraction of the time spent to determine copayment costs manually. Community Care systems reduce the risk of improper invoicing which allows Veterans to experience reduced wait times for care. This is a direct result of automated referral certifications and authorizations. Veterans will benefit by receiving more accurate explanations of benefits coupled within shorter timeframes, improved provider efficiencies resulting from certified compliance in the end-to-end claim and payment processing and they will gain confidence the VA has enabled ease of care from non-VA providers. The Digital Health Platform will improve VistA systems and will reduce operational expenditures, claim costs, and improper payments while decreasing claims processing time. This program strengthens the VA response to suicide prevention using evidence based methods and proven strategies to identify and treat Veterans at high risk for suicide. Telehealth allows Veteran patients to live independently at home, and reduces hospitalizations. Telehealth is providing a significant positive impact for thousands of field clinical staff, resulting in overall improved access to healthcare for veteran patients located in remote areas. The Lab program ensures that accurate and timely laboratory services are provided to a large number of Veterans. It provides a Laboratory Information Management System that addresses patient safety concerns, meets regulatory requirements, provides effective and efficient medical care to beneficiaries and enables planned quality improvements to patient care. The Pharmacy program and return on investment is measured by the decrease in adverse drug events to Veterans that result because of the medication order checking provided.

029-666666700,1849,"01 - Major IT","01 - Not Applicable","	029","Department of Veterans Affairs","	00","Department of Veterans Affairs","Memorials Automation","The purpose of the Memorials Automation investment is to provide secure, reliable, and timely burial and memorial benefits to Veterans and their families. Through the development of a new Memorials Benefits Management System (MBMS) to replace the legacy Burial Operations Support System-Enterprise, VA will migrate to an overall integrated systems architecture that allows for end-to-end management of Veteran information and engagement across VA administrations and align with a VA priority to modernize outdated VA systems. The primary goals of the investment are to 1) Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of delivering burial and memorial benefits, 2) Enable standardized and automated mobile solutions to track remains and validate Veterans and their dependents, and 3) Simplify and enhance security around Personally Identifiable Information (PII)-Sensitive data within applications. 

This investment aims to achieve benefits related to stewardship resulting in empowerment of Veterans to improve their well-being, management and improved Benefits operations to deliver seamless and integrated support, and enhancement and development of trusted partnerships. Anticipated customer benefits will include enhanced customer care and services to Veterans and their beneficiaries and prioritized perspectives and needs of customers - Veterans, families, supporters, communities, and employees. Internal customers who will benefit from streamlined and automated processes are the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) end users who operate on behalf of the Veterans and their families, ranging from scheduling and field operations organizations to the cemetery operators.

The investment also includes the creation of a Veterans Legacy Memorial, a digital online memorialization platform designed to honor the service and sacrifice of our nations Veterans by allowing visitors to share stories and pay their respects to Veterans interred at VA national cemeteries.","029APG18091 - Veteran Customer Experience, 029SO18127 - VA's infrastructure improvements, improved decision-making protocols, and streamlined services enable VA to agilely adapt to changing business environments and veteran needs, 029SO18129 - VA IT modernization will quickly deliver effective solutions that will enable VA to provide improved customer service and provide a secure and seamless experience while decreasing its rate of spend.","By modernizing the Memorials systems, the Investment will greatly reduce the risk associated with continuing to use an aging platform built using outdated code and infrastructure. Once in place, the MBMS will improve end-user functionality, end-to-end decedent chain of custody tracking, real time Veteran claim status will also enable state of the art remains tracking, digital real time GIS/GPS based mapping and geographic information, as well as mobile and web-based user enabling tools. These new capabilities will enable the VA strategic goals of more effective delivery of services and improved National Cemetery Administration (NCA) customer satisfaction in support of Veterans and their families. The NCA will benefit from the increased efficiency of this solution, allowing staff to devote resources to higher value activities, rather than routine data verification and transfer that the legacy system required.  Currently, the highly manual process requires significant re-submission of information that is already housed in a VA database. Using enterprise services and data from VA systems, Veterans and their families will greatly benefit from the reduced amount of information they will need to provide. This will also reduce manual processing and the opportunity for errors in data entry by VA staff, resulting in a reduced burden and timeline for Veterans and their families in correcting errors before receipt of benefits. The current process for capturing, processing, and finalizing memorials benefits orders is based on the applicant providing eligibility documentation by mail or fax and calling a customer contact center to initiate the request process. This process is cumbersome for VA employees, as well as Veterans and their families. To increase the efficiency and effectiveness of NCA processes, the MBMS capability set will significantly automate and streamline the process for ordering benefits and in some cases, allow Veterans, family members, or care providers to order benefits through a self-service interface. 

Once in place, MBMS will provide positive outcomes for NCA related to the automation of forms, verification, eligibility, and validation, as well as allowing self-service capabilities, and improving ordering and scheduling capabilities. This investment enables improved management and operations of the largest cemetery system in the country which currently maintains 136 VA national cemeteries and 33 soldiers lots as well as monument sites in 40 states and Puerto Rico. MBMS directly impacts Veterans and their families at an emotionally difficult time with the death of a loved one. IT investments in MBMS are essential to operate with a high level of professionalism and data accuracy to ensure each individual interred in a national cemetery is buried in the correct gravesite and that their headstone or marker is accurately inscribed. Processing times for burial applications, Presidential Memorial certificates, marker ordering, and interment will be reduced significantly through the system s greater efficiency.","In alignment with VA's 2018 - 2024 Strategic Plan - and the noted agency priority to continue its commitment on delivering seamless and integrated services while increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of virtual access, this investment will improve the quality and accessibility of memorial services to Veterans and their families seeking burial services at National Cemeteries. More specifically, Memorials Automation will support VA's third strategic goal to - Manage and Improve VA Operations to Deliver Seamless and Integrated Support by developing a cost-effective and integrated solution to increase productivity, reduce redundancies, and improve efficiency. Furthermore, this investment will result in improvements to the current Memorials platform in complying with Section 508 guidance as well as security and quality standards.

The Veterans Legacy Memorial (VLM) was highlighted in the President s 2018 Memorial Day speech as a way to safeguard the legacies of our service members so that our children and our grandchildren will understand the sacrifices of our Armed Forces.  To ensure that our veterans  legacies are remembered and celebrated, the VLM online memorialization platform is being developed to amplify the voices of families, survivors, and Gold Star parents and spouses as they honor our beloved veterans and fallen service members.

The purpose of VBMS is to implement a system integrating web-based, paperless processing with improved business processes. The goal of VBMS is to deliver comprehensive Claims Processing services for the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA)/Office of Business Process Integration (OBPI) focusing on the Compensation and Pension (C&P) business line. C&P depended on a paper-based system with a huge document inventory and increasing backlog. VBMS is replacing legacy claims processing software. VBMS implements improved standard business practices for a paperless claims workflow, provides enterprise data services for external and internal communications, and is enabled by an enterprise, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework. As a platform, VBMS will provide VBA with enterprise capabilities for Enterprise Portal, Data Integration, Imaging, Forms Service, Rules Based Processing, Correspondence, Messaging, Workflow Services, and Content Management. VBMS will provide C&P the ability to speed handling and processing of over a million claims submitted yearly, reduce inventory backlog, and continue paying billions of dollars in claims monthly. VBMS enhances services to Veterans and their families by facilitating integration of automated, rules based claims processing with Education, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, Insurance, and Loan Guaranty. This standardization of capabilities will reduce long term costs and align VBA enterprise requirements with OMB requirements for integrating program acquisitions. Claims Automation Phase 1 will enhance Veteran experience by adding self-service features, removing duplicative efforts and reducing legacy system dependencies. By enabling Claims Automation, VBA can create a consistent and repeatable process that enriches Veteran and employee experience, reduces manual activities, reduces errors, improves the quality of service delivered to Veterans (and qualifying dependents) as well as retiring legacy systems. Maintenance of VBMS provides operations, systems maintenance and upgrade support required to keep VBMS up and running. Virtual VA functionality is being absorbed into VBMS. VA & IRS are in the process of determining an acceptable storage solution for Federal Tax Information (FTI), which will allow VVA to be retired.","029APG18091 - Veteran Customer Experience, 029SO18122 - veterans are informed of, understand, and can avail themselves of the benefits, care, and services they choose, 029SO18123 - VA has collaborative, high-performing, and integrated delivery networks that enhance veteran well-being and independence, 029SO18127 - VA's infrastructure improvements, improved decision-making protocols, and streamlined services enable VA to agilely adapt to changing business environments and veteran needs, 029SO18129 - VA IT modernization will quickly deliver effective solutions that will enable VA to provide improved customer service and provide a secure and seamless experience while decreasing its rate of spend.","For Veterans, the implementation of VBMS will result in faster, higher-quality and more consistent decisions. For VA employees, VBMS will result in a more user-friendly claims processing system with better access to information across regional offices, faster system updates, reduced application switching, and automated decision recommendation tools that increase consistency. VBMS benefits both Veterans and VBA employees by providing the tools the workforce needs to quickly and accurately perform their work while meeting growing demand. VBMS was deployed to regional offices in a phased implementation approach designed to minimize operational and performance disruptions that typically accompany major transformation efforts. VBMS objectives in FY19 will facilitate quicker, easier identification and gathering of key records; improve timeliness of notifications and correspondence; and improve consistency and accuracy across all types of rating decisions. Overarching goals of future releases will focus on integrating automated business rules, integrating remaining legacy functionality, and supporting the national workload management strategy. As new functionality is fully tested and integrated into the system, the VBMS Program Management Office continues to identify additional end-user groups that can benefit from VBMS ability to improve timeliness, accuracy, and efficiency. VBMS has successfully migrated hosting capabilities to a completely optimized cloud environment. VBMS will deliver further efficiency gains that enable transparency in the delivery of decisions to Veterans through, improving the ability for Veterans to navigate the entire portfolio of VA services from a single point of entry, supporting a seamless, integrated, and responsive customer service experience for Veterans by providing the back end, single authoritative data source, eliminating burdens and errors associated with frequent, duplicate data entry and empowering Veterans to manage and update their information in a single application enabling them to more easily access their earned care and benefits.

VBMS will begin migrating to the VA Enterprise Cloud Capacity (VAEC) hosting environment in FY19. This will include the Development, Testing, and Production Environments for the program. Once the migration is complete, from Terremark to VAEC, in late FY19/FY20, VBMS will realize a significant cost savings of ~$55M. Moving to the VAEC will also provide the following benefits:

- Reduce operational cost of VBMS infrastructure by 50% in FY19

The idea for mySocialSecurity is to create a personalized, interactive, customizable, and secure one-stop shop for all Social Security electronic services, while providing a superior customer experience.

SSA provides a variety of services to our customers over their lifetime. Enabled by technology, our customers and employees can have real-time access to information. Our employees can use this information to understand our customers  needs. Wage earners, retirees, survivors, and individuals with disabilities, and their loved ones or professional representatives come to our agency seeking immediate assistance, care, and help. Other customers, including employers, businesses, non-profits, advocates, oversight groups, and other stakeholders also require attention and support. 

This investment s goal is to design and develop the products necessary to enable mySocialSecurity to meet the business needs.  The current design is appropriate for individuals accessing their own personal information, but does not include the processes needed to authorize users for the variety of other services. Many of these services are currently available through the agency s legacy registration/authentication application (i.e., IRES - Integrated Registration Services).","016SO18197 - Expand Service Delivery Options","SSA s priorities are to: (1) address the systems core assets, (2) Third party applications, and (3) continue to automate services to reduce operational impacts.

Core Assets are components created or designed for reuse across multiple investments. mySocialSecurity will change navigation and authorization. In addition, this investment will associate one or many beneficiaries to an appointed representative or representative payee. Investing now in a solution for third party authorization will significantly reduce or eliminate the cost of allowing third party authorization for future applications that come behind the portal. Core Assets will also reduce the channels in which data is collected in order to mitigate database connections. In addition, it will reduce the number of repetitive web service calls and CICS transactions made to data stores, which affects server and bandwidth costs. Redundant calls also put additional stress on the architecture because many of these processes have an expectation to operate within the browser sessions for anywhere between 15-120 minutes at a time, or to save, exit, and resume their progress at a later point in time. Migrating the non-compliant IRES credentialing services behind the mySocialSecurity portal will bring the agency into accord with NIST standards for authentication.

A third party application that is a priority is individual representative payee services. The objective is for automated electronic services for Representative Payees to eliminate unnecessary contact between payees and the agency. Supporting Rep Payee journeys behind mySocialSecurity leverages the public s high satisfaction ratings with this established service channel. This benefits SSA in facing future challenges of increasing workloads with constrained resources and creating benefits to the agency and public through technology and process transformation. 

One of the automated services that reduces operation impacts is SSA Verify. SSA Verify allows mySocialSecurity users to select information that can be shared with and verified by 3rd parties for verification purposes.

By ensuring consistency, reliability and availability of enterprise data, OI&T will significantly improve its ability to safeguard and manage the benefits, health information and records of our nation's Veterans. This investment creates the tools and systems necessary to store, access, and present data in a manner that is consistent with the MyVA vision. Enterprise Data Services is key to VA's information sharing strategy capability between VA, Veterans, Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies, and private sector organizations. The investment is also central to VA s efforts to move to a more patient-centric approach that improves the data interchange and technical support necessary for analytical computing and clinical decision support services.

The preparation and presentation of digital forms has produced more efficient claims processing and automation of VA business processes. The presentation of digital claims also lowers costs associated with manual data entry, copying, and storage of Veteran information and documentation, allowing VA representatives to focus more on Veteran interactions. The 30 (approximately) program areas within this investment provide Veterans with more reliable processing of healthcare and non-healthcare benefits. Without these systems, VA would either need to identify and invest in alternative solutions that could provide the same level of services as developed in these systems over the years or be forced to revert to manual entry, retrieval, verification, evaluation, qualify review, determination, processing, updating, communication, and documentation of these service requests along with the applicable qualified level of service determinations. These process of manual business activities would require a significant larger amount of investment than the costs of Enterprise Data Services projects. 

A costs savings analysis of representative efforts within this investment indicated significant annual ROI of (+/-) 24.7% over the topline funding request levels of Enterprise Data Services. A cost benefits analysis was performed by examining VAs strategic goals and objectives and performing an analysis of alternatives to satisfy those needs. Factors considered included: historical costs of preceding processes/systems used to accomplish the same functions prior to establishment of the systems within this investment; analysis of feasible alternatives to current systems/projects in operation; and/or cost substitution analysis if the current systems/projects were not available and alternate means had to be leveraged to complete the same functions. Opportunity costs were determined for the various alternatives by subtracting the estimated costs of the selected alternative from the estimated costs of the next best alternative. The projects reviewed for this analysis yielded cumulative saving levels of nearly $245M annually. The delta between these cost savings vs the annual funding requests for the investment was then divided by the costs expended to develop the representative systems and multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage. (Cost Savings Cumulative/Estimated Costs of Representative Systems) X 100.

The goal of this investment is to support multiple retirement benefits programs that total over $140 billion in annual payments to over nine million federal employees, family members, annuitants, and survivors.  

Operationally, the applications under this investment process 249 Daily Cycles, 12 Monthly Cycles,  approximately 82,000 cases in Federal Annuity Claims Expert System (FACES), $6.7 billion monthly ($80.9 billion annually) gross payments to about 2.7 million annuitants and survivors y,  and $65 billion annual payments to Healthcare Benefit Carriers.  In addition, over 2.6 annuitants/survivors can log on directly to Services Online (SOL) to access their retirement information. 

Benefits of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) activities include support of prompt and accurate payments and administration of benefits to annuitants, survivor annuitants; access to information to support financial literacy of Federal employees; agentless on-line customer support,; and in the future, reduction in administrative costs for maintaining data, improved data accuracy, reduction in processing times, improved access to information to improve employee financial literacy, and better forecasting of retirement trends and other analyses.   These benefits enable OPM fulfill its mission to lead and serve the Federal Government by providing benefits to employees, annuitants, and survivor annuitants; administering retirement benefits; and supporting program oversight using data.

Some of the key OPM program office customers of this investment are; Healthcare and Insurance (H&I), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), and Retirement Services (RS).  Some of the key stakeholders and beneficiaries are; RS, U.S. Department of the Treasury/Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), Social Security Administration (SSA), U.S. Postal Service (USPS), Annuitants and Survivors , and the Federal workforce.","027SO18174 - Reduce the complexity and costs to administer Federal employee retirement earned benefits by achieving and implementing legislative reform, 027SO18185 - Improve retirement services by reducing the average time to answer calls to 5 minutes or less and achieve an average case processing time of 60 days or less","Return on investment is tremendously high since with only a $15 million budget OPM effectively processes and pays $80.9 billion (annually) in annuity/survivor gross pay and $65 billion (annually) in payments to Healthcare Benefit Carriers through the Fiscal Service to ensure payments are accurate and on time.     

Benefits (internal and external to the government) and outcomes achieved:
Internally OPM customers and stakeholders mentioned in section 1 use the applications in this investment to administer the Earned Benefits Trust Funds properly and ensure that benefits are accurately applied/paid to support the Federal retirement benefits plan.

Externally, 2.7 million annuitants and their survivors can access a user-friendly SOL to manage their retirement cases, make changes to their profiles, view and print their annuity, insurance, and tax statements on line, and view the history of their records. SOL reduces the need for customer support, provides faster response times and improved user experience within an optimized information.

Through modernization, the collection of electronic data from data providers and the on-line retirement application will provide for a level of analytics not possible in the current environment which would enable program and policy organizations to improve actuarial projections of future retirements, conduct trend analysis, assist with workforce analysis and forecasting, and create other useful data analytics to inform anticipated workload, determine upcoming changes in the workforce that need to be backfilled or for succession planning and training.  This would inform timing of decisions to hire, help agencies by identifying segments of the workforce that may need to be replace, and enable better workforce planning.

Implementation of an integrated retirement system with case management capability will be beneficial to track and manage all retirement cases, enhance document and record management, manage incoming workloads, manage workforce skills to the workload, increase security of the documents, reduce paper and time processing, provide effective management reporting, and provide complete and accurate information to employees and annuitants using the Retirement Information Office (RIO) and SOL.","OPM administers the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) which are financed from the Civil Service Retirement & Disability Fund (CSRDF) and is responsible for managing the Federal Government s health benefits and life insurance programs under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program.  

Several provisions under Title 5 of the United States Code (USC) and the Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Correction Act (FERCCA) authorize OPM to administer specific retirement program and insurance activities, and to transfer funds for the administrative cost of these activities from the Trust Funds. These authorities provide additional administrative transfers from the Trust Funds. 

Per 5 U.S.C.  8348 (a)(1)(B), OPM incurs expenses from CSRDF for the following activities:
1.	Administering survivor annuities and elections (8339 and 8341) and other annuity alternatives (8343a and 8420a)
2.	Making discretionary allotments and assignments and withholding State income taxes on monthly annuities ( 8345(k) or  8469) upon annuitant request; and
3.	Withholding taxes pursuant to section 3405 of title 26 or section 8345(k) or 8469 of this title.

This investment is funded by the Trust Fund Annual and Title 5 (5 USC 8348(a)(1)(B) (Retirement)) sources.  These sources are part of the OPM statutorily established discretionary account that is maintained with the US Treasury.  The discretionary account is funded by employee and agency contributions to Retirement (CSRS, FERS), FEHB, and FEGLI among other sources. Withdrawals against the account for budget purposes can only be made with the authorization of Congress and they can only be used for the administration of those programs from which the contributions were made (e.g., FERS and FEGLI).

The requirements for this investment are to maintain these IT applications and continue to meet and support the OPM s mission of administering CSRS, FERS, FEHBP, and FEGLI including the administration of Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), retirement Voluntary Contributions, Federal Tax, and survivor annuity elections.

ACWS Dependencies: 
- ACWS has interdependencies with respect to developing and maintaining interfaces to a range of Army, DoD, and Federal systems in order to implement business processes and meet statutory and regulatory policies. 
- ACWS initially had 36 Interface Partners (28 Direct, 8 Indirect) each with their own unique cost, schedule, performance, resource and funding constraints. Risk Reduction Phase efforts reduced overall development efforts (Interface Partners reduced to 25).
- ACWS is dependent on the development and deployment of GFEBS SA in order to operate on SIPRNet..","007SO18267 - Lay the foundation for future readiness through recapitalization, innovation, and modernization","In late 2015, ACWS worked with Ernst & Young to identify several areas of ROI surrounding Business Process Efficiencies and Fiscal Responsibility. Currently, the Army pays approximately $18.5M annually to sustain antiquated and disconnected legacy systems which are costing the Army additional time and money and when it comes to late payment penalties, contracting redundancies, and overall system administration. Furthermore, if ACWS fails to meet the OSD sunset date goal for SPS, there will be an additional cost for SPS licenses (currently funded by OSD) that the army will have to subsume to keep SPS operational, making the total costs for legacy systems nearly the same as the anticipated sustainment costs for next generation single log-on, enterprise-wide ACWS. At steady state, anticipated sustainment costs to the Army for ACWS are slightly more than $20M a year. 

After reaching Full Deployment (FD), ACWS will be able to retire all three legacy systems, recognize early pay discounts, leverage strategic sourcing, and optimize (and standardize) contracting business processes across the Army. Longer transition times to retire legacy systems will result in delayed realization of ROI (potential of more than $80M annually). ACWS will achieve partial ROI upon the initial deployment through FD.

It will provide the Navy and Marine Corps contracting community with a full contract writing management capability and facilitate integration with federally mandated systems, DON financial systems, and industry.  The ePS will utilize Department of Defense (DoD) standards and support auditability.  The ePS will address existing CWS challenges including outdated architecture, limited capabilities, scalability concerns, and existing legacy systems.

Full deployment of the ePS ensures compliance of the DON's contracting abilities with the following legislative mandates: the writing and management of all contracts must now occur in congressionally approved computer systems (Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013); the central management and oversight of all DoD business (10 U.S. Code (U.S.C.)  Section 2222); and all contracting actions must be fully auditable and traceable (Section 1003 of the NDAA 2010 & Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance).   

The ePS will use DoD data exchange capabilities (e.g.; Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Purchase Request Data Standard (PRDS)) in order to achieve standardized data interoperability with external systems.  The Navy Enterprise Service Bus (NESB) serves as the hub to relay procurement data to various finance and other systems of record, such as Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (Navy ERP), Standard Accounting & Reporting System (STARS) and Standard Accounting Budgeting & Reporting System (SABRS).

The objective of the AMMOS is to reduce the cost and risk of developing and executing the capabilities required to accomplish mission operations by exploiting the common elements of the tools and services required by these missions. Missions using the AMMOS develop their operations capabilities by tailoring from the common elements available from the AMMOS. This can reduce cost, since tailoring the elements of a common system is generally more cost effective to the missions and to NASA than having each project develop or acquire their own unique systems. The AMMOS is a mature system with an over 20-year heritage that incorporates the experiences and lessons learned from a wide variety of missions and a wide range of mission scenarios. With this proven heritage, the AMMOS is more risk effective for missions than deploying new systems. The AMMOS was developed primarily to support deep space and certain astrophysics missions. The AMMOS is managed for NASA by the Multimission Ground Systems and Services Program Office (MGSS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

The five main program areas within OFLC are Labor Condition Application (LCA) for visas such as H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3, Prevailing Wage Determination (PWD), Temporary Agricultural Employment (H-2A), Temporary Non-Agricultural Employment (H-2B), and Permanent Immigration (PERM). The Foreign Labor Certification Systems (FLCS) investment funds modernization, operations and maintenance, and quality assurance of the two separate case management systems, iCERT and PERM. iCERT allows U.S. employers to file PWD, H-1B, H-1B1, E-3, D-1, H-2A, and H-2B online applications to hire temporary workers. PERM provides U.S. employers who intend to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. the ability to file and submit online applications.
The purpose of FLCS is to improve access to employment-based visa application services and establish a more integrated customer account platform for filing and tracking applications across the employment-based visa programs. These applications enable OFLC to accomplish its goal of permitting U.S. employers to hire foreign workers, temporarily and permanently, to fill jobs essential to the U.S. economy when there are not sufficient domestic workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to perform the job.
OFLC will modernize their legacy iCERT system with a cloud-based case management system (CMS) built on the Appian-based DOL Case Management Platform. OFLC will conduct business analysis and process-reengineering activities, integrate the solution with other systems, conduct all test planning and execution, deploy operational solution to production, and operate and maintain the solution. Anticipated benefits are improved processes for visa submission and review through IT and BPR enhancements of a cloud-based CMS.
FLCS  key customers include: OFLC National Office, National Prevailing Wage Center, and processing centers.

The ROI is part of a comprehensive analysis of alternatives including feasible alternatives, identification of the most viable alternatives, life cycle costs and benefits, and the financial results for the alternatives.  The ROI for the investment was determined by analyzing the goals of OFLC, existing performance gaps, constraints, and perceived benefits.  OFLC leverages the DOL Cost Benefit Analysis Tool to determine the ROIs for the selected alternatives.  The tool serves three purposes. First, it serves as an educational tool that provides the optimal methodology for determining the cost of each alternative, risk-adjusting the cost estimates, and calculating Net Present Value (NPV), Return on Investment (ROI), and the Payback Period (PP). Second, it serves as a functional tool that project managers can use to conduct the quantitative portion of a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA).  Third, it documents the intangible benefits of each of the alternatives under consideration.  The external benefits for employers and agents include:
 	Save time and money by submitting and tracking applications online
 	Save postage by submitting applications online
 	Save time and money by creating account profiles which can be used to pre-populate certain sections of new applications

In 1930, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was tasked, by the Department of Justice, with collecting, publishing, and archiving those statistics.  Several annual statistical publications are produced from data provided by approximately 18,000 law enforcement agencies (LEA) across the United States.  Participation in UCR is voluntary and is reliant upon LEAs to enter records.

The FBI, Criminal Justice Information Services Division has commenced a Crime Data Modernization initiative to improve the nation's UCR statistics for reliability, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness, and to expand the depth and breadth of data collected.  

This initiative is being achieved through completion of a five-prong approach.  Prong 1 is to transition local, state, and tribal LEAs from the Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the National Incident-Based Reporting System by January 1, 2021.  Prong 2 is to collect use of force incidents which result in the death or serious bodily injury of a person, as well as firearm discharges at or in the direction of a person.  Prong 3 and 4 both include federal LEA compliance with the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988 which mandates all federal agencies report their crime statistics to the national UCR Program.  Prong 3 specifically addresses FBI participation, while Prong 4 facilitates participation from the remaining DOJ entities, as well as all other federal agencies.  Prong 5 relates to technical efforts to enhance the Crime Data Explorer, which is designed to ensure crime data publication is timely and accessible.

In FY 2018, the FBI delivered a minimally viable product crime data collection system to replace the Legacy Mainframe.  The UCR-Technical Refresh System provides:
 
-  Enhanced data management tools for greater efficiency in data collection, processing, and maintenance of crime data.
-  Automated processes
-  Tailored reports on an as-needed basis
-  Streamlined publication processes that gives users quicker access to the data.","011SO18281 - Combat violent crime, promote safe communities, and uphold the rights of victims of crime","The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program has been the starting place for law enforcement executives, students of criminal justice, researchers, members of the media, and the public at large seeking information on crime in the nation. 

Today, five publications, Crime in the United States, National Incident-Based Reporting System, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted, Hate Crime Statistics, and the Preliminary Semi-annual UCR Report are produced from data received from approximately 18,000 city, university/college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participating in the program. The crime data are submitted either through a state UCR Program or directly to the FBI's UCR Program.

The FBI has undertaken a redesign of the system which has supported the FBI's UCR Program for more than 30 years. In support of this initiative, the FBI is currently managing the UCR Technical Refresh (UCR-TR).  This refreshment to the UCR System is a high priority for the FBI UCR Program. The stated goal for this project is to improve the accuracy and timeliness of the data collected, as well as the delivery process. The national UCR Program delivered a minimally viable product of this system on June 1, 2018.  The UCR-TR provides:

 	- Enhanced data management tools for greater efficiency in data collection, processing, and maintenance of crime data.
 	- Automated processes.
 	- Tailored reports on an as-needed basis.
 	- A streamlined publication process.
 	- Users swifter access to the data.

Leading indicators (Measures of Performance) going from the Legacy Mainframe to UCR-TR are:

 	Decreased time for data ingestion process from 6 days to 31 hours
 	Decreased time to return errors and warnings from 1 day to no later than 30 minutes
 	Decreased time to identify outlier values and other data quality questions from 5 days to no later than 49 minutes

The Crime Data Explorer (CDE) is part of the FBI's broader effort to modernize the reporting of national crime data.  It is a web-based solution which enables the public to view and interact with the FBI UCR Program data in an intuitive and user-friendly way.  Continued investments in the development/enhancement of UCR-TR and CDE will result in more timely UCR data being available to the public.","Law Citations: Title 28, U.S.C,   534(a) and (c); Anti-Arson Act of 1982; Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988 in the notes to 28 U.S.C.534; Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, in the notes to 28 U.S.C.534, as amended; Conference Report on H.R. 3355 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1993, Section 15006 Gang Coordination and Information (b) Data Collection; Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3506; Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794 (d)(a)(1)(A)(ii); Section 207 (f) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C.  100, as implemented by the OMB M-05-04, dated 12/17/04; USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, Public Law 109-177 (3/9/06) H.R.3199: Section 307(e) ""Reporting of Cargo Theft; William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 - Requires the FBI to collect information about offenses of human trafficking and additional information associated with prostitution offenses; Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (2009), Section 4708

The WIOA legislation supersedes the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and amends the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, the Wagner-Peyser Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The WIOA legislation allocates federal funding to states in the form of grants to provide job placement, training, and education services to job seekers. Ultimately, these grants are meant to better position grantees (i.e. job seekers) for employment in high demand industries and to help employers identify skilled workers to fill open positions, enabling them to better compete in the global economy. In an effort to better measure the effectiveness and performance of these grants, the WIOA legislation also created new performance measures to evaluate the success of these grants at fulfilling their respective goals, objectives, and mission.

BEA maintains the nation s economic accounts (national, industry, regional, and international) and produces national economic statistics that enable government and business decision-makers, researchers and the American public to follow and understand the performance of the Nation's economy.  BEA s vital economic information includes the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Balance of Payments statistics which are essential to the decision making process of the President, Congress and American businesses; and to the efficient operation of our financial markets.  To perform this critical mission, BEA collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates economic statistics to the public.  

The BEA Estimation IT System (BEA-EITS) is a portfolio of integrated economic estimation subsystems.  This system encompasses the Bureau's core economic processing system and is the primary tool used in the production of the BEA's economic accounts.  The BEA-EITS technical platform supports the production of 15,000 time series estimates each month and thousands of other data produced quarterly and annually. The BEA-EITS directly supports BEA s mission of providing the most timely, relevant, and accurate economic accounts data in an objective and cost effective manner.  Due to the sensitivity of BEA's estimates, the BEA-EITS includes an interdependent, non-shared local area network.  

As a statistical production and analytical agency, IT systems are not secondary support structures, but are central to the core function of the Bureau.  The O&M funds provided by this investment will allow BEA to continue the timely, relevant, and accurate release of more than 60 critical statistical estimates measuring U.S. economic activity.  The DME portion of this investment has been applied to consolidate systems and data stores into integrated components, with state-of-the-art analytic capabilities, significantly faster processing cycles, flexibility to incorporate methodological improvements required to measure a rapidly changing economy, and enhanced internal and external data access.  This investment will provide timely and accurate statistics used by decision-makers to make investment decisions and create jobs.","006SO18034 - Provide Accurate Data to Support Economic Activity","The Bureau of Economic Analysis produces comprehensive measures of the U.S. economy by maintaining national, international, regional, and industry accounts.  From this data BEA produces more than 60 economic statistical estimates each year, including some of the most closely watched economic statistics that influence the decisions made by government officials, businesses, and individuals. BEA's economic statistics, which provide a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the U.S. economy, are key ingredients in critical decisions affecting monetary policy, tax and budget projections, and business investment plans. The cornerstone of BEA's statistics is the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), which feature the estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) and related measures.

Relatively small investments in improvements to BEA accounts can potentially have very large effects. If the more accurate data flowing from these investments were to raise today's GDP growth by as little as 1/100 of 1 percentage point, it would raise GDP by $1.5 billion each year. The budgetary effects of a 1% lower projection of real GDP growth could increase the deficit by $3.5 trillion over 10 years. Over $300B of Federal Funds are allocated to states based on BEA data and over 20 states have statutory limits on revenues and spending tied to BEA's state personal income statistics or some of its components.

The DME portion of this investment funds BEA s highly successful statistical production modernization program, which enables economists to spend less hours underutilized in table checking and data transfers between systems; and can now be used for analysis. These efficiencies contribute to Bureau plans to make available additional internal resources to support critical measurement advances in important areas such as innovation, health care, research and development, household and discretionary income, and the distribution of income within the economy. Enhancements to available data in all these areas are critical to decision makers.","As a federal statistical agency, protecting confidential statistical information is central to BEA s mission. Laws prohibit the sharing of confidential or pre-release statistical source data. BEA conducts ongoing surveys covering international trade in services and foreign direct investment and the operations of multinational companies. Title V of the 2002 E-Government Act, Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA), and U.S. Code Title 22 (containing the International Investment and Trade in Services Act) require BEA to maintain the confidentiality of information collected for statistical purposes. These laws limit access to and use of statistical data collected.

The platform would provide integration with COTS document management capabilities and leverage EGIS for access to existing services and hosting for MLRS geospatial requirements. This effort will be predicated on an SOA that will gradually transition the ENERGY, MINERALS AND REALTY portfolio for improved data, system and workflow integration, facilitate the development of the system of record behavior.  This alternative provides the most flexibility and extensibility to accommodate the integration of systems like AFMSS, MTS, CBS, PRIS, etc. ALIS, ORLSS, and LR2000 are all retired in accord with the transition strategy. In this alternative, ALIS, ORLSS, and LR2000 are retired.

This allows Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to adjust the location of its surveillance capabilities to keep pace with the ever-changing border threat. MVSS consists of trucks outfitted with electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensing devices that aid United States Border Patrol (USBP) agents in the detection of illegal border crossings. The MVSS is an integrated suite of sensor equipment mounted in the cargo bed of a Government-furnished short and standard bed light duty truck (e.g., Ford F-150), with an operator workstation located inside the truck cab. The MVSS goals are to increase the situational awareness of CBP by detecting, tracking, identifying, and classifying potential Items of Interest (IoIs). These goals support Mission 2 of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR): ""Secure and Manage our Borders."" More specifically, the MVSS program addresses Goal 2.1: ""Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches."" Anticipated benefits of the MVSS include: 1) Detecting, identifying and tracking IoIs at distances of up to 5 miles, which provides greater surveillance coverage then possible with an agent on foot; 2) Enhancing U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) Agent safety by providing advanced warning of the existence of IoIs and the nature of the threat, including whether IoIs are armed; 3) Allowing for greater response coordination among local, state and federal officials; thereby improving the likelihood of a successful law enforcement resolution, as well as increased officer and border communities’ safety. Key stakeholders include USBP, Office of Field Operations (OFO), Office of Air and Marine (OAM), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Department of Agriculture, Department of Interior, federal/state/local law enforcement, and U.S./Mexican border communities. The key customer and beneficiaries of the MVSSsystem are USBP agents, who currently rely on legacy capabilities such as sign cutting, which place agents at high risk in difficult locations. By detecting/identifying threats from a safe distance, agents are able to determine the time, method, and location of an interdiction. The short to medium-range ability of this technology provides ample time for agents to prepare for threats.","024APG18014 - Enhance Southern Border Security","The ROI for MVSS is 1,252 percent. A key conclusion of the Analysis of Alternatives is that there is no single technology to answer the question ""what is the best situational awareness technology for the southwest border?"". The answer depends on the specifics of each area, and cueing by one system to initiate tracking by another provides valuable synergies. For example, MVSS is effective for short and medium distance mobile surveillance, whereas the Mobile Surveillance Capability (MSC) solution is more effective for long distance mobile surveillance.  This approach requires a mix of both mobile and fixed alternatives.  MVSS units enable a wider area coverage with fewer resources than the base case scenario. MVSS improves efficiencies through monitoring by providing mobile electro-optical and infrared sensing capabilities that enable Agents to perform their missions. MVSS mobile capabilities are much more efficient than USBP agents on foot or horseback, covering a wider area with fewer resources. This is the preferred solution in certain urban, rural, and remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor with other systems like IFT.  MVSS will be deployed for day or night use when indicators signal that IoIs are approaching an area. Units will also be deployed to augment surveillance systems that have line-of-sight coverage gaps caused by existing infrastructure, terrain (e.g., ravines or washes), or vegetation. MVSS provides mobile surveillance and situational awareness in remote areas over a range of 40 feet to 5 miles from the deployment location, providing agents the ability to respond to threats in varying locations. Other benefits include increased situational awareness of land borders. MVSS will increase material availability of its system to at least 75 percent, enabling Agents to utilize the technology whenever needed. Furthermore, the mean time to repair the units will not exceed 8 hours a month, and the number of corrective maintenance actionswillnot exceed 2 times a month. These performance metrics advance the CBP Goal: Advance Comprehensive Border Security Management and the DHS Goal: to Secure U.S. Air, Land and Sea Borders and Approaches. USBP has greater flexibility in terms of where assets are deployed, based on threats and needs. In addition, Agents are freed to focus on areas with the highest threats, and provided greater lead time to plan effective interdictions. Most importantly, Agent safety is prioritized as they are less likely to work in entrenched, isolated areas or areas with poor visibility, leaving them vulnerable to potentially harmful engagements.  Lastly, MVSS helps minimize vulnerabilities resulting from the human factor. Despite training and experiences, Agents are vulnerable to compromising operational effectiveness due the fatigue and human errors.  In contrast, one or two Agents equipped with the MVSS are able to surveil up to a 5-mile radius, and can respond to illegal activities at a fraction of the time it would take Agents on foot. The MVSS will enable the USBP stations to maintain situational awareness with fewer Agents, e.g. one-man team surveilling a 5 mile radius versus one 1 Agent, per one mile border, thereby reducing overall costs and improving operational effectiveness.","There are no legislative mandates, outstanding audit findings/material weakness, or Presidential Directive related to this investment.",no,no,no,,,"Craig Doheny","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",26.357000,47.308000,15.470000,13.973000,2015,2030,"Significant increase in DME funding in PY 2018 as part of the FY18 Omnibus Bill.

The Infrastructure Protection Gateway (IP Gateway) investment supports the Office of Infrastructure Protection in meeting its mission of assessing key assets and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and taking action to mitigate vulnerabilities, enhance security, and ensure continuity and necessary redundancy.  This includes establishing and maintaining a national database of each system or asset that the Secretary determines to be vital and the loss, interruption, incapacity, or destruction of which would have a negative or debilitating effect on the economic security, public health, or safety of the United States, any State, or any local government.
IP Gateway delivers a suite of specialized tools to DHS Components, Federal agencies, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) governments, and owner/operators of our nation’s critical infrastructure through a modularized system.  These tools aid the collection and protection of our nation’s critical infrastructure information.  A consistent methodology applied to assessments supports robust analytics, asset-to-asset comparisons, and cross-government sharing of critical infrastructure information.  Textual and geospatial interfaces assist users in understanding the underlying data and improve the ability to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities.  Tools reinforce efforts in threat contingency planning and incident tracking.  The IP Gateway provides data on events such as flooding and power outages in semi-real-time.
The system ties together different aspects of protecting infrastructure into one convenient location; this improves productivity and makes our nation safer.  Life cycle cost reduction continues as IP Gateway consolidates and modularizes existing capabilities into a smaller, more efficient server-side footprint, removing redundancy in IT applications.  The specialized capabilities of IP Gateway are available through a secure, encrypted, controlled-access web interface.","024SO18227 - Not Available","Through the facilitation of information sharing in the domain of critical infrastructure (CI), the IP Gateway continues to provide a single source for the Federal government and the CI community. Additionally, it provides capabilities to State, local, tribal and territorial critical infrastructure protection partners (i.e., first responders, homeland security advisors, law enforcement, etc.) that State and local governments would not be capable of providing. The IP Gateway continues to be an economical way of providing secure hosting for multiple applications across multiple Federal entities, such as the Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP), Federal Protective Service (FPS), and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C). The benefits to the government include cost savings in operations and maintenance (O&M), the centralized servicing of the IP Gateway capabilities, and the economies of scale associated with the wholesale procurement of hardware and software.  
The IP Gateway has provided added benefits through the following capabilities that support incident management and steady state risk analysis for critical infrastructure (CI): 
-Making Critical Infrastructure data searchable, accessible and retrievable while still secure 
-Data and report storage capability 
-CI, cyber, and Federal facility risk assessment and analysis capabilities

Streamlining our overpayment process into one system will enable us to more effectively and efficiently post, track, collect, and report our overpayment activity.  In addition, building a new comprehensive overpayment system will allow us to address the system design limitations previously identified via independent auditors.  

This new Debt Management system will allow us to: 
 	Provide increased debt collection opportunities since we will  unbundle  multiple debts which limits our ability to pursue overpayments independently using various debt collection tools;
 	Rectify the system design limitation to capture repayment agreements that extend beyond the year 2049;
 	Prioritize debts to appropriate apply collections; e.g., Civil Monetary Penalties;
 	Capture overpayment collections information in one source from detection to final resolution via a debtor foundational view;
 	Offer channels to repay us electronically which reduces the remittance processing workload in our centralized deposit location - the Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center; 
 	Charge interest and penalties to outstanding overpayments to encourage timely repayment;
 	Automate the paper-based SSA-632 Waiver Request form to enhance controls to ensure completeness and accuracy through data sharing from programmatic systems, automatically halt collection efforts while the waiver request is pending, and provide capability for individuals to request waivers online; and
 	Provide clear and accurate overpayment information to the public through improved notifications and mySSA.","016SO18200 - Improve Program Integrity","The Debt Management Program will develop a product that is aimed at enhancing the integrity of our overall debt management processes and systems.  We will move away from multiple, legacy systems and build one comprehensive overpayment system that will streamline our overpayment business process and enable us to more effectively and efficiently post, track, collect, and report overpayments.  We will also simplify and optimize the remittance process for programmatic debt collection.

 	Supports the agency s fiscal year (FY) 2018 Enterprise Risk Management Risk Profile - Improper Payments risk and the FY 2018-2022 Agency Strategic Plan - Goal #3 Ensure Stewardship, Strategic Objective 3.1 Improve Program Integrity;
 	Supports compliance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act; and
 	Provides the public with expanded options to remit overpayments, while lessening workloads at the Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center and field offices.

The new Debt Management Product will allow us to leverage a single, modern system to improve our processing time, collections capability, provide improved customer satisfaction; improve regulatory compliance; and reduce our technical debt.  Areas we expect to leverage for quantitative value are:
 	Unbundle debts allow for individual tracking and increased collection opportunities;  
 	Track repayment plans beyond the year 2049;
 	Improve our tracking/monitoring controls, and post/collect CMP balances to ensure better collection of current and future CMPs in accordance with approved settlement agreements or default determinations;
 	Reduce the time it takes to process the waiver manually by transitioning from a paper-based system to an electronic system;
 	Automatically get authorization for financial information and send a AFI request immediately, reducing 30 days from current mail process;
 	Improve Management Information (MI) and data used for business intelligence/data analytics and financial reporting; and
 	Reduction in systems maintenance cost.","This proposal aligns with the following mandates:

RRP also aligns to goals within the CDER Strategic Plan, FDA Information Management and Office of Information Management Strategic Plan, PDUFA/GDUFA Information Technology (Draft) Plan, PDUFA, BsUFA and GDUFA User Fee Goals.

Current/Anticipated Benefits: 
RRP is streamlining the regulatory review workflow, automating reports, and providing analytics and metrics. Recent benefits are as follows:
1)      Developed new methods, models and approaches to better identify and manage risks, and optimize the effectiveness of FDA regulatory oversight of human drugs
2)      Leveraged CDER's advanced information tools and analytic methods to support new business process models
RRP also helps CDER realize the efficiencies identified as part of the PDUFA, BsUFA and GDUFA commitments.

Key Stakeholders/Customers: 
The primary stakeholders include all CDER offices engaged in drug and biologic application review.","009SO18217 - Expand the capacity of the scientific workforce and infrastructure to support innovative research, 009SO18222 - Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals","The Return on Investment (ROI) is being realized directly and indirectly in multiple channels, specifically, in replacing a hand tailored, limited use software product with industry standard COTS, supported data, workflow and data marketplace tools for regulatory information. This replacement alone is reducing time (design and development) and effort (cost of implementation) to keep systems updated to changing business requirements and mandates. It is expanding to accommodate the expected increases in New Drug and Generic Drug Approval volume, plus reduce Generic Drug approval backlog. System replacement is improving background IT utilization, by reducing the number of operating systems, software and hardware licenses and manpower required versus the multiple compartmentalized “stove pipe” tailored systems currently in use. Upgrades will be supported by COTS vendors and supporting contractors working throughout the industry with these tools. 
Standardizing the data, workflow and data marketplace tools is improving efficiency of processes, reducing process redundancy, and lowering training costs versus the multiple systems used prior to RRP. Risk is greatly reduced as a scalable system is in place to carry the weight of increased review workload and new requirements for quicker turnaround (PDUFA, BsUFA and GDUFA ). Security is requiring less manpower to manage with a lower number of software and hardware systems to monitor. 
Direct benefit will continue to improve process efficiency reducing the time to approval of regulated drugs, allowing more drugs to be approved annually in a growing drug approval pipeline. Changes to process driven by Government or Scientific mandates will be easier and less expensive to accommodate on widely used industry generic tools, rather than hand tailored single use software. 
Retired system costs and O&M for legacy systems can be used in incrementally improving the Informatics Platform processes and supporting equipment.

The RRP Business Case, revised December 2015, predicted a five year ""Organizational Cost Savings"" of $78 million, and an additional ""Stakeholder Benefit"" of $24 million. RRP allows CDER to meet drug review efficiencies as specified in the PDUFA, GDUFA and BsUFA commitments and provides a path for faster consumer access to health care products.","RRP helps FDA comply with PDUFA, BsUFA and GDUFA legislative mandates by providing a state-of-the-art review framework to support Regulatory Review processes and help meet requirements on user fee amounts and allocations.

By September 2018, the CRM Enterprise project will begin deploy a modern, mobile Contact Relationship Management (CRM) tool to all U.S. Missions overseas as well as domestic offices that require this functionality, replacing legacy homegrown contact management, events management, and email marketing solutions. CRM will deliver the following benefits to the government: Save time: As a cloud-based system, CRM will reduce duplication of effort across systems. Data centralization ensures continuity during officer and staff rotations. Unification of email marketing and event management empowers users to create integrated campaigns that are consistent, professional, personalized, & supported by robust analytics.Protects data: CRM is secure. It has a FISMA moderate certification, as authorized by FedRamp, and has secured a Moderate Authority to Operate from the Department in February 2018. Increases mobility: Users can access data securely on a mobile phone. Data is also accessible on a PC connected to OpenNet or another Internet connection.Integrates with Mission websites: CRM integrates with Mission websites, wherein site visitors can subscribe to embassy mailing lists. As a result, the Department will have an automated means to grow & enrich contacts with foreign publics. Improves data quality: CRM enables posts to capture a variety of contact interactions, including emails, phone calls, & meetings. This data is reportable, making it possible to track & share a contact’s history of engagement across the enterprise. Enables data-driven decision making: CRM provides comprehensive, accurate reporting. Users can send targeted emails to groups of contacts across sections who meet specific criteria. CRM helps users understand audience engagement and improve outreach performance by collecting real-time data on events like open and click-through rates.Stays relevant: CRM is hosted on an industry-leading platform-Salesforce, which issues frequent, automatic system updates & continuously updates functionality based on feedback from thousands of clients worldwide, including every cabinet agency and 80% of the Fortune 500. CRM will automatically inherit platform enhancements, ensuring that functionality remains modern and relevant at no additional cost to the government.","014SO18092 - Provide modern and secure infrastructure and operational capabilities to support effective diplomacy and development","From an ROI perspective, by centralizing contact management in a single database across the enterprise, the Department can consolidate development, security, hosting, and operational resources in support of one platform. Instead of investing in separate lines of effort for each of these critical technical components, this can be funded once for the enterprise. CRM consolidates contact management, email marketing, event management, and analytics into one platform, rather than maintaining the status quo of supporting these functions as separate Department applications. This improves the Department’s security by reducing the number of access points for privacy data - providing a single database that can be closely monitored & appropriately encrypted. It saves cost on auditing, as well, as the vendor inherits the bulk of security controls on behalf of the government and the Department must only resource the evaluation of one CRM for the enterprise, rather than auditing each homegrown system separately. CRM is hosted on a cloud platform that regularly updates to its foundation, ensuring that the software remains secure and modern, saving the Department time and effort in maintenance. What sets CRM apart is that it is hosted in the cloud. The technology supporting CRM is configured and managed centrally by the Project Team in Washington, reducing the need for IT specialists at post to maintain multiple technologies. Centralization will lead to greater data standardization, knowledge sharing, and better data quality across the Department, while still allowing posts to manage their own data. Once CRM is successfully deployed to the enterprise, the Department will have a centralized, accessible, uniform database that preserves all employee engagement with foreign contacts in one platform. By centralizing this, the Department will have access to a robust data set that will give senior leadership insight into how staff are performing and how work can be improved to align withstrategic goals. For the first time, engagement will be measurable across the enterprise.From an ROI perspective, by centralizing contact management in a single database, the Department can consolidate development, security, hosting,& operational resources in support of one platform.

It also aligns with 05 FAM 01110, which outlines Department cloud policy. As CRM is a cloud platform, it adheres to the 2010 25-point plan's objective to shift to a 'Cloud-first' policy. The plan states that:  'When evaluating options for new IT deployments, OMB will require that agencies default to cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable, cost-effective cloud option exists.' This guidance is also outlined in 5 FAM 1114, which states: 'all new Department IT projects must implement cloud services (e.g., private or U.S. Government-owned, community, public, or hybrid) whenever they are cost effective, meet system/owner mission requirements, and provide the required level of security and performance.' Since several commercial secure, reliable, cloud-based CRM products exists, the Department should adhere to FAM and OMB guidance and implement a cloud solution for contact management.

This Act benefits the agency in the following ways: 
 	Strengthens oversight by increasing the number of representative payee reviews, requiring additional types of reviews, and improving the effectiveness of the reviews by requiring the Protection and Advocacy system of each state to conduct the reviews, on behalf of the Social Security Administration (SSA)
 	Reduces the burden on families by eliminating the requirement to file an annual payee accounting form for parents who live with their children and for spouses
Enhances personal control by allowing beneficiaries to designate their preferred payee in advance of actually needing one, and ensures improved selection of payees by requiring the SSA to assess the appropriateness of the preference list used to select payees
 	Improves beneficiary protections by increasing information sharing between the SSA and child welfare agencies, and by directing the SSA to study how better to coordinate with Adult Protective Services agencies and with state guardianship courts

Includes 3 distinct capabilities:  

- Secure clinical Video Teleconferencing (VTC) (synchronous visits) enables a provider in one location to offer diagnosis and treatment to a patient in another location. Synchronous visits can take place between a provider and patient at different military treatment facility (MTFs), or at the patient’s location.  Synchronous visits at the patient’s location can be conducted for primary or specialty care which will enable health care anytime, anywhere. 

-Incorporates an Asynchronous secure portal or teleconsultation portal, to enable a pool of specialty care providers globally to deliver timely clinical advice, primarily in operational settings where expertise is scarce, but also in garrison when needed.  The portal facilitates ‘store and forward’ transmission of electronic medical information and associated digital images between health care providers.  Specialty clinicians provide expert advice and guidance to the patient’s attending physicians, assisting them in the disposition or local treatment options. 

- Remote health monitoring, to collect, track, and transmit biometric data from the patient via a secure portal to an MTF.  Data accessed by care coordinator or health care provider at the MTF to provide real-time medical interventions that can improve a patient’s health and quality of life.  

GOAL: 
MHS VHP will connect our beneficiaries to health care globally to increase readiness, access, quality, and patient safety.

BENEFIT: 
Using virtual health (VH), the best of MHS Medicine across the world can be brought to the patient wherever they are – deployed or in garrison.   As a modality without geographic limits, VH extends access to quality primary care, behavioral health, and medical specialty care to remote locations where beneficiaries may be geographically separated from comprehensive MTF based care, and where such care is not readily available in the surrounding community. Additionally, VH can help the MHS use its clinical capacity more effectively; cross-leveraging clinical expertise when and where it is needed.

Customers: Beneficiaries, healthcare providers, MTFs and primary end-users patients.  
Stakeholders: Services, Joint Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) and DHA.
.","007SO18266 - Restore Military Readiness to Build a More Lethal Force","-Virtual Visits/telehealth (TH) to the patient's location (primary & specialty care) has a net benefit of approximately $152.8 million across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) after investment costs of $67.5 million.  The efficiency gained is from using a lower cost of delivery of care through virtual visits instead of using traditional healthcare delivery methods.  Offers the best financial return on investment (ROI) projection; Virtual Visits avoids approximately 1,870 emergency room, urgent care, and specialty care office visits in the first year, increasing to 35,517 by FY2023; and leverages existing unused capacity to accommodate up to 33,487 primary care and 54,432 specialty care visits in the first year for beneficiaries who may not have been seen through an in-person appointment; (projected to escalate to 1.1 million specialty care visits by FY2023).  The sensitivity analysis resulted in an ROI of 2.48 for the FYDP which indicates a positive return on investment.

-Teleconsultations creates a readiness benefit by connecting all providers in the Military Health System (MHS), regardless of geographic location, offering a support system for deployed providers, creating a sense of community and connection while deployed, and improving access to care as primary care clinicians are able to treat more cases with assistance from sub-specialists.  Efficiency is achieved by avoiding medical Temporary Duty (TDY) costs (patient movement) and preventing patient referrals to the Purchased Care network. This equates to an efficiency of $112 per Purchased Care encounter avoided and $4,020 per patient for patient movement avoided or an estimated $43.4 million.  The sensitivity analysis resulted in an ROI of 3.05 for the FYDP which indicates a positive return on investment. 

-Remote health monitoring potential ROI is achieved through reduced re-admissions, decreased Emergency Room (ER) and/or outpatient visits, and reduced hospitalization/length of stay. The sensitivity analysis resulted in an ROI of 0.38 for the FYDP.  Once the capability is refined, following lessons learned from the National Capital Region (NCR) and the San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), additional specialties can be added, which are likely to further increase ROI.

While the current registration system continues to fulfill its mission of processing and reviewing applications for operating authority, the process is ripe for modernization and further efficiencies, particularly regarding vetting carriers that may be reincarnated or “chameleon” carriers. Previous FMCSA initiatives to improve the registration process, and to identify and act upon special types of unsafe carriers reincarnating, have been met with success. This contributes directly to the FMCSA goal of raising the bar to enter the motor carrier industry so that only carriers that are fit, willing and able can operate.   In addition to new key URS Re-Architect capabilities, as of the BY 2019 submission, the URS Re-Architect investment will include the legacy registration system functionality being performed in Licensing and Insurance (L&I) and modernization of the Utility for Risk-based Screening and Assessment (URSA) tool.  These include licensing and insurance system functionalities such as insurance verification and BOC-3 processing agent designation processes.  They also include back end access capabilities for authorized Federal and state users to retrieve license and insurance information as well as access information referencing the status of commercial motor carriers, hazardous material shippers, and companies with blanket designations.   In summary, the URS Re-Architect will streamline the existing registration process for FMCSA-regulated entities by incorporating the USDOT Number as the single identification number for registration. FMCSA internal authorities can more effectively track and monitor the operations of motor carriers, brokers, freight forwarders, intermodal equipment providers (IEP), hazardous materials safety permit applicants (HMSP), and cargo tank facilities (CTF) using registration and application indicators.","021APG18034 - Reduce Surface Transportation-Related Fatalities, 021SO18095 - Systemic Safety Approach, 021SO18098 - System Operations and Performance, 021SO18103 - Mission Efficiency and Support","URS Re-Architect will enable interstate motor carriers, freight forwarders, brokers, Intermodal Equipment Providers (IEP), Hazardous Materials Safety Permit (HMSP) applicants, and cargo tank facilities under FMCSA’s jurisdiction to submit required registration and biennial update information to FMCSA via a new electronic online submission and processing of the MCSA–1 Form.
  URS will incorporate the requirements and functionality of three legacy registration systems into one streamlined online system.  These legacy systems are the USDOT Identification Number System, the 49 U.S.C. chapter 139 Commercial Registration System, the 49 U.S.C. 13906 Financial Responsibility Information System and the Service of Process Agent Designation System.
 URS will replace these legacy systems supporting FMCSA’s motor carrier industry safety and commercial oversight responsibilities.
  The main benefit to this initiative is that URS Re-Architect will streamline current Federal registration processes and increase the accessibility of data concerning regulated entities. The information collected will support the DOT strategic goals concerning safety by ensuring FMCSA can more efficiently track data related to motor carriers, property brokers, freight forwarders, cargo tank facilities, and IEPs that are currently required to register with FMCSA. Significant cost savings have been realized to date with the operational components of URS, for example, $4.2M savings for industry in time savings completing applications, $983K savings for FMCSA in decreased contact center application processing, and

The applications have cumbersome, outdated user interfaces and are difficult to connect to other systems. Through this project GSA will 1) conduct a pilot for full stack application modernizations and 2) to transform a number of GSA systems that are on legacy proprietary software to open source technologies. This transformation will simplify integrations with other systems; enable greater agility, resiliency, scalability, and performance; allow GSA greater flexibility in recruiting talent; and in the long term, lower the cost of operations and improve the quality of the applications.

The current applications also have a high dependency on legacy proprietary technology, which is challenging to maintain and lacks the flexibility to allow users to easily and quickly obtain the actionable information that they need compared to more modern open-source technologies. It is also challenging for GSA to recruit talented resources to work on these legacy applications. Through this project, GSA will pursue full transformation of the planned applications, including the hardware, database layer, and application layers. GSA will use a cross-functional Solutions Team that has deep understanding of the current applications  technical specifications and collaborated to create a set of standard target technologies to migrate towards.

Without this funding, GSA would need to continue using these outdated applications in most instances and would only be able to pursue modernization to decouple legacy technology piecemeal as funding became available. However, with this funding, GSA will be able to pursue the modernization of a significant portion of impacted systems as a coordinated project using best in class agile methodologies. By the end of this project, GSA will have modernized a meaningful percentage of its applications that are dependent on proprietary technology, and will have generated a playbook for such modernizations that can be put to work in future GSA efforts as well as at other government agencies. GSA anticipates it will have a greater ability to service its mission by making it easier to access actionable business information and through expanding the use of more flexible open-source technologies, which will benefit the American people.

The Project Team selected the most conservative estimate (low-cost savings) due to the unknowns associated with future proprietary contract re-negotiations. 

The overall ROI for this Low-Cost Savings scenario is 14% because there is an overall, projected $2.2M in cost savings associated with transforming the databases for the 11 applications in scope for TMF. While GSA expects there will be no reduction on the proprietary technology contracts, this scenario assumes that GSA will achieve cost savings by: 

1. Reducing the O&M costs for 11 GSA applications from FY 2022 through FY 2029 due to the benefits achieved from the Database Transformation project.

Based on our analysis, a phased IT transition would increase service disruptions on OPM Programs and exacerbe personnel turnover. 

The recommended approach is the only scenario that allows GSA to facilitate transformational change while minimizing business impact and immediate transition costs (for eg, avoiding the one time transition cost Mackenzie estimated in their  2018 OPM IT Assessment  of $88-$110M -  based on the upper-end costs of IT divestitures and transitions.). Migrating all OPM IT as a single unit will reduce the diseconomies of scale and migration costs associated with phased transfers where individual IT portfolios are extracted. Having full visibility and budget/contract/implementation control over OPM IT will allow GSA to build a smoother long-term transition plan to perform a more granular disaggregation of systems to minimize long term inefficiencies. 

In addition, a number of proposed re-organizations will change the structure and composition of OPM as National Background Investigation Bureau (NBIB) is transferred to the Defense Security Service (DSS). Parallel transitions to GSA where IT portfolios are transferred incrementally would add additional strain on OPM resources forcing them to support multiple IT migrations. Migrating all OPM IT as a single unit to GSA will allow for eventual decommissioning of NBIB at a later time and after the new generation background check system namely NBIS is implemented by DSS.
