GCSS-MC is based upon the Marine Corps Logistics Operational Architecture and logistics business process reengineering initiatives. GCSS-MC is part of a joint GCSS effort, managed by the Joint Staff J-4, aimed at improving logistics capability and filling in deficiencies in the accuracy and timeliness of logistics data. GCSS-MC/LCM:  GCSS-MC Logistics Chain Management (LCM) is a program within GCSS-MC Portfolio.  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of the Portfolio.  It provides initial capabilities for GCSS-MC.  The system provides Combat Service Support functionality: Supply, Maintenance, Task Organization, and Request Tracking in a shared data environment in support of deployed operations. Specifically the system centralizes logistics information for access by multiple authorized users (closing a significant warfighting gap), complies with the J-4 GCSS Mission Area Interface Control Document that establishes a DoD Family of Systems for logistics information visibility and decision support, and satisfies initial Marine Corps requirements for meeting Combatant Commander 129/57 Data Elements that provide asset visibility data to Combatant and Joint Task Force Commanders.

The MDD also supported the development of acquisition planning documentation with a target to enter the formal acquisition process.    Phase I of the AoA focused on preliminary assessment of nine (9) alternatives; five (5) of the alternatives were considered potentially viable and carried into the AoA Phase II for more detailed analysis. During the second quarter of FY11, TMA was directed to pause the AoA to support the joint program analysis efforts undertaken by the DoD and VA.  On March 17, 2011, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the VA agreed to jointly pursue a common EHR acquisition.  The Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) (a follow on to originally proposed Electronic Health Record Way Ahead) is designed to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that is available anytime and anywhere for the lifetime of the patient. Since the original Electronic Health Record Way Ahead (EHR WA) has now become a joint DoD/VA program, iEHR has received an Acquistion Decision Memorandum and is now an official DoD program.

The EIB requirements include Shop Floor Automation (SFA), Item Unique Identification (IUID), Enterprise Equipment Master (EEM), and Automated Identification Technology (AIT). The Inc 2 will also provide the expanded capability for the standardization of ammunition AIT,  Non-Army Managed Items (NAMI) management, Army Prepositioned Stock (APS) planning, National Maintenance Program (NMP), and the expansion and refinement of the integration between Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. These requirements have emerged from the DoD, the Army and the AMC industrial base. The fundamental concept is to leverage the LMP Inc 1, integrate commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products (i.e., SAP Complex Assembly Manufacturing Solution (CAMS) and SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (MII)), and connect the necessary AIT while supporting the AMC Business Process Reengineering (BPR) efforts. The LMP Inc 2 expanded capabilities are designed and tested together in a comprehensive solution based on the SAP software. Expanding the LMP solution with the COTS capability from the same vendor, provides pre-integrated key touch points and ensures compatibility as software product upgrades occur in the future. The complexity involved in implementing the Inc 2 requirements independently was neither logical nor supportable within current resource constraints. The solution for these requirements are designed, built, and tested together; and implemented in cohesive packages to the LMP user community that will meet the critical needs of the various stakeholders. The Inc 2 enables the Department to achieve a clean audit while providing interoperable tools for total asset visibility across the Defense Enterprise. Ultimately, Inc 2 will extend the efficiency and effectiveness of the currently deployed solution; will provide access to real-time supply chain information at all levels of the enterprise down through the shop floor; will result in improve visibility of work-in-process (WIP), quality management, capacity planning, and traceability; and provide electronic work instructions. Implementation of the Inc 2 will minimize re-work, causative research, material cost escalation and labor costs increases and comply with the DoD IUID implementation directive.","2012-06-28","2016-12-30","321.500000","5-Mixed","","no","Delivers production releases in accordance with the approved aquisition strategy","1-FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior","0","0.00","Green","14.211000","4.42","Green","In-progress","2014-12-12","10:35:32"

Similar to the Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) initiative, ED would take the lead to control requirements and development to ensure the cloud is vetted by the federal government.

Activities include collection of new information on end-user requirements and comparison with other existing syndromic surveillance systems that could be adapted to produce standardized system requirements and program design concepts for revisions to the BioSense Program. This will include gathering end-user requirements through formal and informal communication, utilizing unstructured data to gather information on other syndromic surveillance systems and system needs, developing an Operational Plan, and reviewing/revising the existing Strategic Plan to reflect changes in the BioSense Program. It will also require establishing a TEP, which will provide input and advice on the development of the new BioSense Program. It will further require producing standardized system requirements for program design concepts and prototypes, which can be developed using open-source/open-access tools. Program design concepts and prototypes will be reviewed and evaluated internally and by an external group of end users. The final selected program design concept/ prototype will include specification, security requirements, proposed program development, testing and evaluation, and documentation. Management support will include the following:- updating the existing BioSense Strategic Plan;- assessing the risks inherent in this plan (already commenced, but assessment of the risks will be ongoing throughout the project);- producing and actively maintaining a Risk Mitigation Plan for the BioSense Program;- providing project support and administration.","2010-06-07","2014-10-15","15.600000","4-Agile","","yes","","4-Other certification with 4 or more years PM experience (within the last five years)","-131","-8.97","Green","-0.660000","-4.24","Green","Completed","2015-02-05","14:36:50"

Improve the BioSense System- accomplishing this goal will lead to enhanced programmatic and technical capacity of the BioSense program for both CDC and State, Tribal, Local Territorial (STLT) jurisdictions. The goal can be achieved by the following objectives:*         Standardize system requirements and program concepts to improve data collection, access, quality, and timeliness*         Gather end-user requirements through formal and informal communication*         Gather information on other syndromic surveillance systems and system needs to improve the BioSense system*         Develop an operational plan to ensure that support of current environment is sustained*         Review and revise existing plans and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to reflect appropriate changes needed in the BioSense system*         Make necessary changes to the BioSense system for supporting collection, data quality monitoring, access to, analyses, and use of surveillance data2.       Provide necessary support to STLT jurisdictions and their data providers- accomplishing this goal will lead to enhanced programmatic capacity and capabilities of the BioSense program for both CDC and STLT jurisdictions. The goal can be achieved by the following objectives:*         Support jurisdictions and data providers in uploading surveillance data. This objective can be achieved by technical support for onboarding, which is the process of making a secure connection from the data provider to BioSense so that a test message transmitted by the data provider is received and verified by BioSense. A facility is considered onboarded when such a connection has been established and one successful test message has been received by BioSense from the data provider*         Support increased use of BioSense data.

The original goal of MAS was to utilize MAS throughout the five levels of the Medicare appeals process. This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process. The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed.  Given the MAS' capabilities for cross-level case tracking, interfacing with the shared systems, and electronic imaging, we believe that expanding use of the MAS to encompass first level appeals has the potential to create significant efficiencies in the claim appeals process. Thus, CMS is exploring options to implement the MAS at all Durable Medical Equipment MACs (DME MACs) and Part A and Part B MACs (A/B MACs).","2011-09-16","2012-09-15","0.420000","6-Other","This release has employed a Like Agile methodology.

MARCS is divided into a set of components. There are application and service components. The work flows in ORA will often cross multiple organizations and include a number of different user activity types such as screening, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, and compliance. The application components are designed to provide user groups with a one stop shop interface that will allow them to perform work from their user point of view. Functionality is only implemented once in a component. One user group work flow may use functionality from most of the MARCS components. This has implications for the management of MARCS. While the individual projects build out certain types of functionality, these need to be combined and coordinated into a whole in order to provide a useful work flow that covers the whole life cycle of a regulated product as it passes from one user group to the next. This combination and coordination needs to occur at the program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. PMTI includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI begins work on a release when it is time to start system integration testing. Work for a release includes system integration testing, promotion to the pre-production environment, performance testing, user acceptance testing, promotion to the production environment, security testing, and then release. Program management in this project includes release management and management of dependencies.

This will be an important integration point between MARCS and the Automated Laboratory Management (ALM) Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The WAAM component will be used to plan, assign, and track all work in MARCS. The functionality provided by WAAM will be used by all of the ORA work flows in MARCS. WAAM will provide functionality that will be used by all of the application components in MARCS. WAAM functionality is being built out over a set of projects, often in conjunction with work on FWM. Functionality is built out in an incremental fashion where, for example, one project might focus on requirements and design and another project would focus on development and test.","2012-03-30","2013-03-29","1.155000","","","","","2-FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-2)- Mid-Level","0","0.00","Green","-0.078000","-6.75","Green","Completed","2013-05-24","14:03:02"

This provides access to historical data from a number of systems, such as MARCS. The DW further contains a reporting database that retains the schema from the Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database from which information was originated. The DW has information in it that has been transformed into a star schema so that it is a Decision Support System (DSS). In addition, for some user communities, it is much more effective for them to only have to deal with a subset of all of the data in the DW. For such user communities, ORADSS has a number of Data Marts (DM) that certain designated users can use for querying. These are also used to support universes for reporting. ORADSS uses a COTS, Business Objects (BO), as a reporting tool. BO utilizes universes as a meta-data layer that allows for an abstraction of the underlying schema, table names, row names, and data types so that non technical users can access this data more easily. The universe structures may then be used to build reports. End users typically interact with the reports, but there are a number of end users who need to delve more deeply into the data than is allowed by a report. These users may access the DW, DMs, or universes directly depending on their particular needs.

FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information. This includes receiving firm information from registration and listing from the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS). FURLS is being partially replaced by eLIST. FMLS will integrate with eLIST (no acronym). The firm data is built around Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). These define a location and a product or a set of products. A large company may have multiple FEIs if it has multiple physical locations and/or produces different products that are regulated by FDA. This information is always changing as firms and market conditions change.  In addition, foreign firms that do not use a Latin alphabet present a particular problem as words can be transliterated into English in different ways. If this is left unchecked, it causes a proliferation of FEIs that are not all that useful in identifying what firm is what. To address this, FMLS employs Dataflux, a COTS, in implementing survivorship rules that are used to clean up this firm data and consolidate and remove FEIs. FMLS is also being integrated with Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB). DnB has one of the largest and most reliable databases on businesses in the world. This is being leveraged to improve the quality of firm information, especially that related to foreign firms. This project focuses primarily on integrating with eLIST, improving survivorship rules and their application, and integrating with DnB.

FDA receives much firm information via Center systems, including FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS) and eLIST (no acronym). This will focusing on improving and automating more of this information transfer. Gray area resolution is used to resolve uncertainties regarding firm information when the survivorship rules used in FMLS do not produce a clear resolution. Survivorship rules are implemented via the COTS Dataflux and are an automated way to correct firm data, merge, unmerge, and delete Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEI). Manual gray area resolution is performed to tweak survivorship rules and manually resolve information discrepancies.

In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established.   The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors.  Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy. FHA serves the needs of more than 20 Federal Agencies in domains as diverse as military and veterans' healthcare, public health monitoring, long-term care and disability services, research, tribal health services and many other critical Federal priorities.","2004-04-30","2018-09-30","74.574000","7-Not Primarily a Software Development Project","","n/a","","4-Other certification with 4 or more years PM experience (within the last five years)","0","0.00","Green","0.747000","2.04","Green","In-progress","2015-07-24","11:34:23"

In addition it supports the objectives of the HHS Chief Financial Officer community and HHS strategic plan.  Oracle's E-Business Suite environment will become obsolete in December 2015 when Oracle's exception to the extended support ends.  At that point HHS will stop receiving quarterly patches for UFMS which may impact the security, reliability and availability of these systems and leave the system vulnerable.  The latest version of Oracle Federal Financials (R12) also provides significant functional enhancements that will strengthen HHS' compliance with Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA).

CTEP-ESYS tracks more than 27,000 patients per year in more than 24 disease areas. The system supports 517,000 drug orders and 37,000 registered investigators. Data reporting and analysis in real time is critical to ensuring adequate monitoring of the ongoing clinical research. Timely data reporting and analysis also assures effective planning for the required successor studies, thus accelerating the evaluation of promising new agents and regimens for patients with cancer. An effective CTEP-ESYS allows investigators and researchers to focus on scientific opportunity, patient safety and reducing the burden of cancer on the public by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. There are many components that support CTEP needs including protocol tracking, agent authorization and tracking, clinical data reporting, adverse event reporting and processing, clinical trials auditing, financial management, investigational new agent and development, disease management and tracking, annual report generation, regulatory activities, account management, investigator registration, reporting and analysis. CTEP-ESYS consist of a common repository that interfaces with suite of applications that are integrated and support the cancer-clinical trials infrastructure.","2009-02-01","2016-01-31","9.000000","4-Agile","","yes","","1-FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior","0","0.00","Green","0.400000","4.44","Green","Completed","2014-09-12","14:43:10"

The number of quality measures to be included for 2012 is not established at this time.  There were 190 quality measures in 2011.  For 2012 there will continue to be multiple reporting options through claims and will continue to include measure groups.  The Physician Quality Reporting System will support multiple submission methods such as Electronic Health Record Registry and Group Practices Reporting Options (GPROs I and II).  It is anticipated that the incentive will be based, as in past years, on the total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the reporting period.Continuing in 2012, there will be the Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Initiative which is available for those EP's that are considered successful electronic prescribers (eRx-ers) as defined in the CMS eRx specifications.  As in 2011, both individual and selected GPROs may report on the eRx measure through claims, registries or EHR's.  Successful eRx-ers will potentially earn an incentive payment based on their total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the 12 month reporting period.  Currently successful electronic prescribers will not be eligible to receive an incentive under the eRx Incentive Program if they are also receiving an incentive under the Health Information Technology (HIT) Incentive Program authorized by the Recovery Act, enacted on February 17, 2009. Future rule making may further align the incentives programs. EP's that are not electronic prescribers will receive a penalty adjustment starting in 2012 based on the first 6 months of claims data submitted in 2011.  The eRx Initiative will provide Interim Feedback Reporting to EP's.  Measures and other data sources may be added for the 2012 Program Year to allow EP's options for successfully reporting the eRx measure for both the penalty and incentive programs.EP's may have the flexibility of expanding and adding additional hardship codes for exemption for all years.","2012-03-10","2015-06-30","121.700000","5-Mixed","","yes","","4-Other certification with 4 or more years PM experience (within the last five years)","-62","-5.40","Green","-0.842000","-0.70","Green","In-progress","2015-07-24","11:34:25"

By 2014, it is expected that an additional 16 million people will become eligible for Medicaid and CHIP as a result of the Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148 - Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). In order to implement the statute, CMS must provide for a mechanism to ensure timely approval of Medicaid and CHIP state plans, waivers and demonstrations and provide for a repository for all Medicaid and CHIP program that supplies data to populate  Healthcare.gov (sec. 1103) as well as other required reports. With these tremendous statutory changes in the Medicaid and CHIP programs, CMS will undergo a transformation from a reactive, mostly paper based processing entity to an active, electronic based program manager by automating and streamlining the current systems and processes.CMS is in the process of evaluating Medicaid systems currently operating, in order to build an enterprise architecture platform and data repository.  Ideally, CMS would allow for a single point of entry to access various program and operational data applications.  This effort will be implemented in phases over several years.  Phase 1 will provide for a Medicaid and CHIP Program data system (MACPro) accessed through a web portal/portlet that will automate the input and retrieval of data from the states related to the State Medicaid and CHIP Plans (including Demonstrations and Waivers).  This system will also support an efficient workflow for the review and approval of the State Medicaid and CHIP process. States will access this system and submit program information into structured data templates.  CMS staff will review the templates for compliance with federal statute, regulation and policy, provide feedback to the states and track/monitor the review and approval process.  Future project phasing will provide for the design, delivery and implementation of financial management programs and performance and quality metrics. CMS must meet a hard deadline for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. This system will be operational in phases with the eligibility, benchmark plans, demonstrations and waivers portions/modules to be implemented before December 30, 2013.","2012-02-24","2015-12-30","40.000000","4-Agile","","yes","","8-No certification, but with between 2 and 4 years PM experience (within the last five years)","-487","-72.58","Red","7.056000","25.13","Yellow","In-progress","2014-09-29","14:48:43"

Under the capitated model of the financial alignment demonstrations, the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office is working with participating States to test a new payment and service delivery model to improve the quality of care that individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (Medicare-Medicaid enrollees) receive.  The goals are to expand access to seamless, integrated programs, while reducing expenditures under Medicare and Medicaid, and enhancing the quality of care furnished. This project modifies the existing Encounter Data System (EDS) for purposes of processing those encounter data described as being Medicare services to develop the capability to price the MMP health care encounter data to be able to estimate the cost of a dually eligible beneficiary enrolled in an MMP. For those encounter data described as being Medicaid services, the data is collected, edited at the translator level and stored along with the Medicare services encounter data in the CMS Repository. Under this project a copy of all encounter data submitted by the MMPs is also sent to the corresponding State Medicaid Agency. The project includes analysis, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance of the Medicare Medicaid Data System (MMDS), including modifications to EDS, as well as operational and policy training to MMPs and other entities. Inherent existing functionality of the EDS, such as identification of diagnoses codes to be sent to the Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS), processing and submitting Part D Events is included.Because the system is modified to receive Demonstration Medicaid Encounters as well, the capacity to process encounters submitted in the NCPDP format and Dental Encounters will be added.","2013-06-15","2016-12-31","8.200000","5-Mixed","","yes","","8-No certification, but with between 2 and 4 years PM experience (within the last five years)","154","12.34","Yellow","0.953000","12.91","Yellow","In-progress","2015-06-26","11:40:09"

DOJ requires a dedicated suite of capabilities to identify, prevent, and if necessary hunt, pursue, and mitigate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) that target DOJ networks.  These are high end threats that current capabilities (A/V, configuration, etc.) do not catch.  Currently DOJ can not inspect over 40% of network traffic because it is encrypted through SSL from host inside DOJ networks to destination; exactly where APT's operate.  Likewise, when APT are successful, DOJ can only maintain 5 days of PCAP information to rebuild network sessions and analyze the attack.  30-60 days is the industry standard to allow for notification and proper investigation of the malicious activity.

This would delay the eventual completion of the intended project as resources would be diverted to making frequent temporary changes to bridge software rather than providing modernized and enhanced software.","1-FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior","0","0.00","Green","-0.044125","-0.37","Green","In-progress","2015-02-06","19:26:03"

Further, the approach includes a lifecycle approval step where FIT reviews and compares an agency's migration proposal to the common services and products to verify the following:  (1) the agency's needs align with the common services and products; (2) the agency can offer support (e.g., regulatory, statutory) for any needs beyond the common services and products; and (3) any verified Services and Products gaps can be satisfied by one of the designated SSPs.  Once an agency has an acceptable modernization plan, it will begin a brief discovery phase with an SSP process whereby both organizations must agree that the services and products offered by the SSP satisfy the needs of the agency.","2013-10-01","2014-03-31","0.400000","","","","","1-FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior","6","4.92","Green","0.025003","6.25","Green","Completed","2014-02-26","14:02:33"

FIT captures and aggregates the measures reported by the SSPs in a reporting tool (or benchmarking tool) that aggregates the information as a government-wide benchmark.  FIT, Federal SSPs, and Federal agencies can use the benchmarking tool to compare the cost and performance of the Federal agencies financial management activities to the price and performance of the Federal SSPs.  The benchmarking tool is a web-based application with defined metrics based on seven financial management end-to-end business processes, including Procure-to-Pay and Bill-to-Collect.

Clinicians and claims adjudicators rely upon and use, on a daily basis, at a rate of over 5 million queries per year, clinical records that BHIE provides. BHIE provides HIE for clinicians and adjudicators to deliver efficient, effective, and timely treatment and claims processing. Clinicians avoid duplicating radiological, lab, and other tests and studies by using BHIE derived clinical data. If BHIE were not funded, then interagency clinical record exchange would degrade and fail.

As a result, the Suicide Prevention Center of Excellence, which gathers data from the Veterans Crisis Line Application, does not have the ability to properly report on self-directed violence in a manner that is consistent with industry nomenclature and standards.
