In September 2011, SOL awarded an Evidence Management Initiative (EMI) contract to IE Discovery, Inc to provide both litigation support services and a cloud (or cloud-like) IT system that allows evidence sharing capabilities to DOL's staff nationwide.  Following award, the vendor worked with The Office of the Solicitor (SOL) to conduct detailed project planning and provide cost and schedule estimates based on the scope of work.  These estimates are to replace the pre-award projections and add accuracy and detail to the EMI portion of the master schedule.     The Matter Management Initiative (MMI) portion of the investment is currently well into the development and testing phase of the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  This project recently encountered a number of delays due to application-level security vulnerabilities, and has modified its schedule to remediate these issues and mitigate future problems.  Following rebaseline the investment's Integrated Master Schedule will reflect current activities, durations, costs, and timelines to be used for proactive management and performance reporting on both EMI and MMI.","524,525","Projects, Activities","2009-2018","","","08/09/2012","15:22:23","8927"

To accomplish this, Secretary Solis has formulated a series of strategies for reforming worker protection at the Labor Department With new challenges and new directions there has been a redirection of system scope and functionality to better align the OIS with the Department of Labor's recently released Strategic Plan and the Secretary Solis outcome goals.To accomplish these goals OIS system requirements need to be modified and enhanced to address the revised functionality.  For example, OSHA's methodology for penalty calculations for violators of occupational safety and health rules and regulations has been significantly modified and therefore the OIS has been redesigned to capture and accurately calculate these important changes.  Another example of significant functionality change is the addition of a new critical agency program called the Severe Violators Enforcement Program (SVEP). Similar redesign of the OIS has occurred to incorporate this new and important program.Also, data migration and data cleansing of OSHA's legacy occupational safety and health data has incurred considerably greater resources to accomplish.  One of the goals of the new OIS is to provide more accurate historical occupational safety and health data to the public, to other Executive Branch departments, and to the Congress.As a result of the new challenge, new directions, requirement updates, architecture modifications and additional training requirements for the key stakeholders, OSHA senior management understands that OIS needs additional funding as well as an adjustment to the deployment schedule. The impact of these changes has caused the life-cycle costs to go from $84 million to $91 million.  These factors have also resulted in the additional funding of $3.1 million for FY10 and 11, as well as the need to increase federal resources in FY11 and out years. In addition, the BY12 and out years reflect an increase in FTEs based on the organizations need to manage OIS increased functionality.  The deployment schedule will be adjusted from October 2010 to March 2011","","","","86.13016","2017-09-29","01/14/2011","14:20:18","2625"

These reasons are as follows: Milestone 43 for O&M year 7 has been deleted as no funding has been allocated for that task for that year as yet. Milestone 32 was erroneously stated to be 100% complete while the task is still in progress. Hence it was changed to 99% to reflect the correct progress. The cost has been updated to reflect the level of ongoing effort. Milestone 26 comprised of two tasks. Hence milestone 26 has been split to reflect the separation of tasks. The EA portion of the task has been designated as a separate milestone (#47) Since milestone 26 and associated tasks have been split into two separate tasks and milestones, (#26 and #47) the cost of level of effort has also been split to reflect the cost of each task without altering the initially planned total cost.

This program has not gone through ADE 2A / IRB review and is not baselined as of 2/8/11.  ADE 2A / 2B review is currently planned for May 2011. All milestones beyond FY11 are generic in nature. The eHR Program is using a SOO based acquisition strategy to acquire non-developmental COTS/GOTS/SaaS solution with no customization.  IHSC (business client) has identified the critical or essential minimum functional requirements for the desired solution that vendors must provide (approx 650 out of 2,000+ requirements).  Remaining functionality will be allocated across software releases based on IHSC priorities and available funding.  Until the actual COTS/GOTS/SaaS product is selected and baseline functionality determined, the EHR PM is unable to allocate functions to specific releases beyond the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) and therefore has placed generic milestones in the schedule.  As the program proceeds and functions are allocated, these milestones will be updated.","","","","207.146","2020-09-30","02/23/2011","10:20:18","3076"

STIP requires a rebaseline of Project Execution data in order to remediate schedule inaccuracies that have occurred due to shifts in PSP and EBSP priorities (and subsequent shifts for STIP project activities).  STIP utilizes Firm Fixed Price contracts for development efforts and therefore will not incur additional costs as the result of the schedule slips.  Rebaselining the current data will allow the Program to accurately track and report on its projects, and provide improved cost and schedule data for project milestones.  Additionally, STIP has implemented the use of an Integrated Master Schedule to manage its projects.  This has resulted in improvements in scheduling and forecasting project resources, and enables forward planning such that additional schedule slips do not occur.  Lastly, as part of the rebaseline, STIP will be able to implement and track accurate and realistic performance targets.  This will improve DHS's ability to monitor the performance of STIP as a system, and accurately reflects the current environment.","372,373,374,375,376,377","Projects, Activities, Metrics","2005-2020","","","07/30/2012","14:18:43","8773"

Replan of existing FPLS Projects: The Move NDNH to Relational Database and e-Employer Search projects, which are part of the FPLS FY2012 Project Baseline, each have activities that carry over into FY2013.  When the FY2012 baseline was developed, a placeholder schedule for these milestones was input, since the official project schedule had not yet been approved.  Based on the most recent stage gate review for each of these projects, the FPLS Strategic Planning and Oversight Board (SPOB) has approved minor changes in cost and schedule for the following FY2013 activities: #291864, #291755, #291756.  These changes represent a less than 10% change from the original baseline, and constitute a replan. 2.    Updating FY2012 Project Descriptions: A number of existing FY2012 project descriptions have been updated to include project objectives and outcomes, per current OMB guidance.  In addition, language related to FY2012 project stages at the beginning of FY2012 has been removed or updated. 3.    Adding FY2013 and FY2014 Projects to the FPLS Baseline*         Annual update to add planned future projects. 4.    Adding FY2013 targets to existing FPLS Performance Metrics*         Annual update to current year targets. 5.    Changing the reporting frequencies from semi-annual to annual for the following existing FPLS Performance Metrics, and adding alignment with HHS Goals and Objectives: In FY2012, five of the FPLS' Performance Metrics were reported on semi-annually.  However, the semi-annual frequency is not appropriate to most of the FPLS metrics.  The annual data is more meaningful because of variations seen throughout the year, so these metrics are being changed based on the new OMB guidance.  Four of the metrics will be changed backed to annual for the FY2014 E300 submission, including: FPLS Benefit-to-Cost-Ratio, Total FPLS Attributable Collections, Percent Increase in Number of IWOs Sent Electronically, and Number of States with Access to the State Services Portal. 6.    Deactivating an FY2012 Performance Metric for FY2013 and beyond: In FY2012, one of the FPLS Performance Targets was to increase locate and enforcement actions returned to State Child Support Enforcement Agencies by the FPLS.  This has been an ongoing performance metric for a number of years, achieved through enhancements to the FPLS locate functionality, and the identification of new sources of locate information.  At this time, increasing locate sources and data is no longer an FPLS management priority, and the number of locate and enforcement actions remains constant, or varies based on the NCP population demographics.  Therefore, this metric is being removed from the FPLS performance baseline for FY2013 and beyond. 7.    Adding FPLS investment start and end dates:*         The FPLS does not have a planned end date; however, this field will be populated with a future date to comply with current OMB requirements.","3761,3763,3765,3767,3769,3771,3773,3775,2206,2209,2210,2211,2214","Projects, Activities, Metrics","1996-2020","","","09/12/2012","16:06:22","9347"

The project as designed under the 2.0 rules would not meet the new 3.0 rules to get LEED certification, so there were changes in design and construction that increased the cost and schedule.","","","","144.582","2029-09-30","02/22/2011","18:00:07","3057"

Since that date, and through the means of progressive elaboration, the team has refined the technical refresh scope, cost and schedule plans.  This refined data is captured in the 2/14/2011 rebaseline activity. 2) The Coast Guard and DHS recognize the importance and value of OMB's 25 Point Implementation Plan to reform Federal Information Technology Management dated 12/9/2010.  As such the Direct Access team has highlighted a number of end user functionality deployment activities that were previously covered under the annual O&M milestone rows.   These activities are shown in new milestone rows 38-43.  Further detail highlighting ~6-12 month deployment activities will be presented in the Direct Access FY2013 Exhibit 300 update. It is important to note that the rebaseline changes presented in this 2/14/2011 update do not affect overall scope or cost objectives.","","","","184.497","2017-09-30","02/22/2011","17:59:43","3056"

In order for IMS to match the EVM data the program office had received from the contractor, the program office had to adjust the planned value with the understanding that the planned value at that point in time as opposed to the planned value for the entire contract.  In actuality, the C4ISR project is running under budget on one of the contracts.

During Fiscal Year 2012, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Leadership made a decision to transfer and store all collected MA encounter data to the CMS enterprise environment. Therefore, a contract was executed to develop and test the transfer and loading of encounter data into the Integrated Data Repository (IDR) to enable standardization of multiple data sources for operations and analytic purposes.  In addition, an analytic and reporting contractor was hired to develop the reporting requirements and framework to conduct analysis in the IDR. These decisions impacted the projects baseline schedule and budget established for the investment. The encounter data investment will result in more accurate tracking and reporting of beneficiary Medicare Advantage health care utilization which will allow for more accurate calculation of plan payments.","2045","Projects, Activities","2009-2020","","","03/25/2013","10:50:44","12503"

CMS has made significant progress with understanding the impact of this extremely large initiative and has more precisely identified the scope.   CMS was in the beginning stages of assessing the ICD-10 impact when it created the original baseline.  The sheer scope and scale of ICD-10 required over a year of analysis to identify over 70 impacted IT systems, multiple business processes, and numerous policies.This revised ICD-10 project management strategy has been adopted by the ICD-10 Steering Committee and should result in a more effective method for defining, managing, and tracking costs and schedules for the ICD-10 implementation milestones.","","","","38.503","2013-09-30","08/31/2010","16:09:21","1095"

First, milestones must be adjusted to be consistent with the final operating budget numbers as well as to incorporate supplemental funding from MIP-D. Second, changes are necessary to be compliant with additional guidance to present milestones at a more granular level. The current FY 2011 baseline is comprised of the following: one year-long operations & maintenance milestone ($18,517,000 for 10/1/2010 to 9/30/2011); and one year-long project management milestone ($1,097,000 for 10/1/2010 to 9/30/2011).  The proposed FY 2011 baseline would be comprised of the following: two operations & maintenance milestones (one for web hosting, hardware, and software and a second for system operations and testing); two six-month milestones for the bid & formulary projects; and two six-month milestones for the marketing & audit projects.  The future milestones would also be updated to adhere to this new structure. Finally, the FY 2011 baseline would retain its existing project management milestone with an updated cost amount of $1,338,000 to reflect two new ACA hires.","","","","306.216","2017-09-25","02/18/2011","10:29:08","2905"

The two metrics to be updated are as follows: #3 - Percentage of the time the monthly HPMS to OIS system feeds are delivered timely.  This would be measured by a successful transaction of the data to Gentran by noon of the day of distribution. Change Baseline from: 92%  to 83%Change Target for CY from: 96% to 92%#4 - Percent of users with a positive HPMS experience as captured in the satisfaction survey with the HPMS business owner community. Change Baseline from: 85% to 60%Change Target for CY from: 90% to 80% Change Reporting Frequency from: Semi-Annual to Annual Rationale: These performance metrics were added to the investment last year.  At that time, CMS had insufficient data in order to establish appropriate baselines and target percentages.  As a result of reporting and tracking these metrics for one fiscal year, CMS has determined that changes are required, as described above, in order to take into account our actual experience and create reasonable target goals.  CMS has also identified a need to change the reporting frequency for the HPMS Customer Satisfaction Survey (measure #4).  In last year's exhibit, annual was not provided as an option, so the 6-month interval was selected for this measure.  Since we are now permitted to have annual metrics, CMS will be changing our HPMS customer satisfaction survey to an annual schedule.  Administering the survey on an annual basis will provide adequate time to incorporate user feedback into the system as well as give HPMS users an opportunity to experience the enhancements prior to the subsequent survey period, all of which will contribute to more meaningful survey results.

For FY14, two new releases - Release 4.0  (Parent Activity - Line 36 and corresponding child activities - Lines 52-56) and Release 4.1 (Parent Activity - Line 37 and corresponding child activities - Lines 57-61) were added as per the EPLC guidelines.   Operational Performance Metrics:Metric ID 285241 was revised to reflect current investment / project objectives. Metric ID 285241 originally referred to collection of defect statistics as a generic measure - as the stabilization/sustainment efforts are drawing to a close, the existing metric was updated to capture a more specific target area of defects remediation - i.e,, the number of db values/db admin scripts to be remediated.   Metric ID 285242 related to single sign-on (SSO) was Deactivated and will be deleted once approved by the HHS CPIC Team, because all applications under ADIMS were PIV-enabled in FY12, this performance measure is no longer relevant.","2175","Projects, Activities","2004-2019","","","10/31/2012","13:49:16","11031"

These baseline changes are consistent with FDA direction, the expected path of the program, and with determinations made pertaining to individual projects by both ORA business and OIM IT.  Rebaseline Description:ALM is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are three (3) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:Set 1: Rebaseline - other. The following projects a BCE rebaseline event: Note - although the funding reduction we are explaining here qualifies as a rebaseline according to the definitions in the BCE guidelines, perhaps this would more accurately be described as a correction since it is primarily due to a data entry error - Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.FDA ORA ALM Laboratory Management Information Systems (LIMS) Program Management and Technical Coordination (PMTC)FDA ORA ALM Laboratory Management Information Systems (LIMS) Laboratory Assessment and Pilots (LAP)FDA ORA Quality Management Information System (QMiS) Support 2The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved baselined project schedules have been entered.  The costs for these projects required adjustment based on the more detailed activities.  Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.  The project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost.  These adjustments are resulted in changes of more than 10% to cost and are thus being reported as rebaselines.The original budget for the QMiS Support 2 project was approximately $748,000 and this is now reduced to $509,000.  Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.  The original budget for the LIMS LAP project was $7.522 million and this is now reduced to $6.727 million.  Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.  The original budget for the LIMS PMTC project was $705,000 and this is now reduced to $550,000.   Operations and Maintenance costs were deducted from the overall project budget, which was erroneously included before.Set 2: Replan - The following project has a BCE replan event: FDA ORA ALM eLEXNET Support 2. While there has been an increase in the overall budget of this project resulting from the incorporation of more detailed budgetary information for eLEXNET activities provided by the contractor and a more accurate estimate of program management costs from secondary contractor for this project, this change is below the percent (10%) threshold required for rebaselining.  In this replan, activity descriptions in eLEXNET have been further developed to ensure that they capture more fully the contractual requirements. Set 3: Replan (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The summary of funding table was updated on 12/21/2011 to reflect actual obligations for FY2011 as is required by the budgeting process each year.  Only FY2011 values were changed.","2168,2169,2170,2171,2172,2173,2174","Projects, Activities, Metrics, SoF","2000-2014","","","02/24/2012","11:16:57","7441"

Analysis of adverse event and safety report information is critical to achieving this goal. The FDA needs to modernize its aging systems, improve its analytic capabilities, and make it easier for the public to submit adverse event and safety reports to the FDA. This investment was comprised of two primary efforts: the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) and the public-facing reporting portal known as the Safety Reporting Portal (SRP-formerly known as MedWatch Plus Portal) and a unified core processing process/systems. FAERS will deliver the back-end application and database for data that supports post-market safety surveillance analysis for FDA regulated products. SRP and the core processing were to be the front-end, enabling a reporter to submit voluntary or mandatory reports to FDA on any regulated product. Core processing would provide services to ensure the data was complete and ready for analysis and public release. The MW+ investment was established with a broad scope that included all regulated products with many internal stakeholders and a very diverse set of business processes and needs. FDA conducted an internal assessment of the investment in late 2009. The assessment findings indicated that the project was too complex, difficult to manage, understaffed, and that the technical feasibility of a single system for all product types was questionable. It also noted that the current SRP concept depends on external factors for which FDA has limited control, including development and operation of the SRP system and questionnaires by the National Institutes of Health. Changes to the implementation approach include: FAERS and SRP are to be separated into two different investments FDA is shifting to a more outcome-focused operating model as recommended and has developed a FAERS schedule that will provide operational releases in 6 month intervals to establish a regular cadence of delivering outcomes. FDA has appointed a senior Lead PM, with 25+ years experience, as the single responsible person for the successful execution of the project. FDA has been transitioning from its current classic single-system, single-server architecture to a cloud architecture. The new FAERS will be implemented in the FDA Contractor Hosted Data Center in a private cloud environment, realizing operating cost avoidances.","","","","53.673","2015-03-31","04/22/2011","10:09:55","3950"

This improved efficiency aligns with recommendations from the FDA Science Board. These changes to CDER/CBER FAERS resulted in a delay in retiring legacy AERS.  FY11 costs decreased due to incorrect updates in the Summary of Funding in the previous submission.  The Summary of Funding costs for FY11 now accurately reflect FY11 actual costs as previously reported to HHS and OMB. CDER/CBER FAERS -DQRS ProjectDue to the large number of changes, it was determined to be more efficient to deactivate the old project activities and replace with new ones.  In addition, the previous activities did not fully meet the requirements of the new Exhibit 300 format.  The new CDER/CBER FAERS baseline takes advantage of the new format by removing out-year planning activities that are not yet fully defined and by creating a new project for the next phase of development, which is to include DQRS functionality into CDER/CBER FAERS and retire the legacy system.CDRH FAERS ProjectCorrected FY13 FTE rate - reduced from $250,000 to $130,000 per FTEThe CDRH cost and schedule changes are attributed to re-evaluations and technological solution changes on the CDRH FAERS project due to product end of life cycle.  The CDRH FAERS team has completed an alternatives analysis of platform options and is pursuing an independent verification and validation (IV&V) step before making the final technology decision.  This change in technical direction has resulted in a 6 month schedule delay (production release scheduled for 3/13/2013 (estimated)), an increase in planning costs in FY12, and a decrease in development costs for FY12.  Previously reported development releases 5.0, 7.0, and 8.0 will be replanned after the IV&V is completed and a final technical direction is established.The increase in FY12 O&M costs is a result of an error in the original rebaseline resulting from a transposition of numbers in CDRH FAERS O&M cost.","3069,2148,2149","Projects, Activities, SoF","2008-2020","","","04/02/2012","09:25:29","7953"

These baseline changes are consistent with FDA direction, the expected path of the program, and with determinations made pertaining to individual projects by both ORA business and OIM IT.  Rebaseline Description:MARCS is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are seven (7) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:Set 1: Rebaseline - change in funding strategy (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The  MARCS Investment is reduced by $4.729M in FY 13 as a result of the requirement from OMB to represent Data Consolidation and IT savings in budget authority (BA) as compared to the FY 2012 Enacted BA.  This cut has been reflected in the summary of funding table for MARCS for FY13.  The DME (excluding planning) costs have been reduced from $12.687M to $10.687M.  The O&M Costs have been reduced from $9.086M to $6.357M.  This is consistent with a recent review of MARCS that was conducted internally within FDA.  While this funding level is being reduced for FY13, the full scope of MARCS has not changed.  Thus, $2.729M is being placed into FY14 DME (excluding planning) costs to increase this from $7.630M to $10.359M and $2.000M is being placed into FY15 DME (Excluding Planning) Costs to increase this from $3.926M to $5.926M.  O&M spending will be constrained in order to emphasize new development in accordance with the FDA internal Technical Status review underway.  O&M cost reductions will be accomplished based on O&M task orders that control the number of releases per year and  defects addressed.Set 2: Rebaseline - change in scope (E300b, Section B - Projects).  The project FDA ORA MARCS Hardware Acquisition through MARCS 3.1 has been removed from MARCS as the result of a portfolio management decision within FDA.  The costs for this project are now part of the FDA Operational Infrastructure or the FDA Information and Computing Technologies for the 21st Century (ICT21) investments.  This project is being deactivated and removed from MARCS.Set 3: Rebaseline - other (E300b, Section B - Projects).

The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered.  These changes are greater then the 10% variance as required by OMB and are thus rebaseline changes.Set 4: Replan (E300b, Section B - Projects).

FWM 4 and WAAM 4 are being introduced in order to address the hardware and consequent technology changes required by the new Oracle Exadata and Exalogic hardware.  The acquisition and use of this hardware was an FDA level decision.  MARCS has to adjust to accommodate this.  The expected cost of ARRMS 3 is $1.502M.  The expected cost of FWM 4 is $0.546M.  The expected cost of WAAM 4 is $1.155M.  This is a total additional cost of $3.203M.  The total MARCS lifetime cost is expected to be $272.165M.

Until the re-planning of the program is complete, future development will remain largely unknown. Currently there are several future milestones (#26,#34,#36,#42) listed that are beyond the 1 year increment threshold. At this time, due to the unknown future of the program, it is impossible to provide a more accurate, segmented schedule of future development. Recently, ACE went through an internal audit of this Cost and Schedule table to confirm all costs were represented and allocated correctly. It was determined that a number of closed milestones needed to be updated to be consistent in our reporting. Milestones (#3, #5, and #19) had a drop in total costs due to the re-allocation of costs to more appropriate milestones. Milestone #6 was de-activated because it was determine that OIT Support costs are more accurately reported as operations and maintenance. This resulted in the substantial increase in costs for operations and maintenance milestones (#13-#18).

These baseline changes are consistent with FDA direction, the expected path of the program, and with determinations made pertaining to individual projects by both ORA business and OIM IT.  Rebaseline Description:RBIS is submitting a set of Baseline Change Events (BCE).  The highest precedence of these events is a rebaseline event.  There are four (4) sets of BCEs that are being addressed.  These are listed below:Set 1: Rebaseline.  The following projects have a BCE rebaseline event: FDA ORA RBIS Data Availability (DA)FDA ORA RBIS Data Evaluation and Recommendations (DER)FDA ORA RBIS Data Quality (DQ) FDA ORA RBIS Firm Master List Services (FMLS) Enhancements FDA ORA RBIS Report Development Support (RDS)The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered. Additionally, the scope for the RBIS DA, RBIS DER, and RBIS DQ projects has changed, resulting in an increase or decrease to the project lifecycle costs that exceeds 10%.  The contractor has reallocated work between projects, which has resulted to changes in the scope of these projects and led to this variance.  The specific changes to the lifecycle costs of these projects are as follows: the budget of RBIS DA was increased from $1.104 million to $1.635 million.  The budget for the RBIS DER project decreased from $519,000 to $275,000.  The budget for the Data Quality (DQ) project decreased from $822,000 to $582,000.  The budget for the RBIS FMLS Enhancements project decreased from $417,000 to $316,000.  The budget for the RBIS RDS project increased from $1.841 million to $2.085 million.  The reason for the changes in the costs of the RBIS DA, RBIS DER, and RBIS DQ projects are as follows.  The DA project was intended to pick up later phases of work started under the RBIS Data Warehouse, Data Marts, and Universes (DWDMU) project.  The work accomplished under the DWDMU project led to a larger scope for DA than originally anticipated.  This resulted in an increase in the project's scope.  For the RBIS DQ project, the Contractor was able to leverage Dunn and Bradstreet (D&B) resources more than was originally planned, thus reducing the anticipated cost. The result was a decrease in project costs.  For the RBIS DER project, the contractor received a lower estimate from a subcontractor for work to be done under this project than was expected, resulting in a lower cost.   The project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost In the case of the RBIS FMLS Enhancements and RBIS RDS projects, the overall scope did not change even though the project costs increased or decreased by more than 10%, as is evident from the numerical information provided above.  This is due to primarily to costs associated with integration for FMLS and a higher than anticipated demand for report changes for RDS.  The costs for these projects required adjustment based on the more detailed activities, but the overall scope for each project has not changed and the project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost.Set 2: Replan.  The following projects have a BCE replan event: FDA ORA RBIS Center and External Integration (CER)FDA ORA RBIS Data Warehouse, Data Marts, and Universes (DWDMU) The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered.  These changes are all within the 10% variance as required by OMB and are thus replan changes.Set 3: Replan (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The summary of funding table was updated on 12/21/2011 to reflect actual obligations for FY2011 as is required by the budgeting process each year.

The costs for these projects required adjustment based on the more detailed activities, but the overall scope for each project has not changed and the project level cost differences did not impact investment level cost.Set 2: Replan.  The following projects have a BCE replan event: FDA ORA RBIS Center and External Integration (CER)FDA ORA RBIS Data Warehouse, Data Marts, and Universes (DWDMU) The activities for these projects were initially coarse descriptions of the project scope.  The schedules for these projects have since been baselined and activities according to the accepted and approved project baselines have been defined and entered.  These changes are all within the 10% variance as required by OMB and are thus replan changes.Set 3: Replan (E300a, Section C - Summary of Funding).  The summary of funding table was updated on 12/21/2011 to reflect actual obligations for FY2011 as is required by the budgeting process each year.

The updates reflected two budget changes that occurred late in FY11, after the initial baseline change request had been approved. 1. The investment incurred additional, unexpected, costs of $1.292 M for Licenses.  This cost increase was reflected in the O&M for FY11, increasing that Prior Year O&M costs from $6.429 to $7.721.2. The Annual enhancement budget for the two reporting systems had been estimated at $690,000.  A Task Order requisition for needed enhancements was processed; however the vendor estimate was above the expected amount.  The Task Order was awarded at $777K at the end of September.  The FY11 DME was therefore increased by $87K  from $690,000 to $777K.  The combination of these two changes increased projected funding over the lifetime of the investment by $1.379M from $188.598M to $189.977M.  The Summary of Funding table was changed in December to reflect these actual costs for FY11.   However, the FY11 DME baseline activity associated with modifications and enhancements could not be changed to reflect the $87K  increase in funding because that section of ProSight was closed to changes in December.  The changes will be made if the new baseline is approved. These requested changes to the baseline will synchronize the DME activity funding with the Summary of Funding.

In 2008, the HHS ITIRB determined that NHIN CONNECT did not properly belong within the FHALOB Egov Exhibit 300, but rather should be treated as an independent investment with its own Exhibit 300. In addition, it is anticipated that FHA and ONC will undergo substantial changes reflecting the new Administration's priorities.

The proposed Baseline Change in the FHA Program reflects an additional $1.557M in FY12 than originally estimated provided by FHA Funding Partners (i.e., VA, CMS and SSA), utilizing the authority of the Economy Act of 1932, in order to continue the development of CONNECT Gateway, as well as.an acceleration of FY12 Expenditures for CONNECT development using esisting funds. The total FHA FY12 proposed Baseline Change reflects an increase of $2.578M for CONNECT Gateway development. In addition, there are very minor adjustments to the FY13 FHA Performance Metrics Descriptions and Units of Measurement to reflect the expanded scope associated with CONNECT Gateway development and the NwHIN Exchange transition to a public-private initiative.The CONNECT Gateway initiative enables Federal Agencies - and private sector organizations - to integrate their health information systems into the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) standards and services. In addition to CONNECT, NwHIN Exchange is the critical portion of the National health IT agenda intended to facilitate development of a secure, nationwide, interoperable health information infrastructure that will connect providers, consumers, and others involved in supporting health and healthcare. Investment will enable health information to follow the consumer, be available for clinical decision making, and support appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care so as to improve health outcomes. The investment seeks to achieve these goals by coordinating stakeholders in developing interoperable standards and by engaging industry in developing prototypes and trials.CONNECT Gateway is an open-source software product that implements the service and content specifications of NwHIN Exchange. This product acts as web-services gateway, connecting an organization's health information systems, such as EHRs, and allowing exchange of information across the gateway via NwHIN-specific web-services and protocols. Gateway allows an organization to easily adapt their systems to exchange in an NwHIN-compliant manner, without having to modify each of the systems behind the gateway.  CONNECT Gateway is focused on the implementation of standard services and payload content to enable the secure interoperable exchange of health information.  This project was started and funded by the Federal agencies to address the requirements that they must implement approved standards and support interoperability. The Federal strategy was to form a Federal health IT consortium to jointly govern and develop via shared investment a common solution that would then be deployed and operated separately.","2197","Projects, Activities, Metrics","2004-2015","","","09/12/2012","16:06:11","9343"

Guidance received from HHS late in Q2'10 concerning ARRA spending necessitated re-scoping of several of the planned projects and acquisitions. Original planning for RPMS development projects was based on known high-level requirements and needs from IHS programs and application business sponsors. Once funded these projects underwent review, refinement, and requirements definition with input from the stakeholders.  The impact of these considerations has been that the IHS OIT has scaled back on the number and the size of RPMS development and deployment projects that can be expected to be completed during the ARRA timeframe and with ARRA funding.  Furthermore, we have restructured all program lines into which both ARRA and regularly funded RPMS work is categorized. The previous 8 functional areas of work have been revised down to 4 main strategic areas; Practice Management, Patient & Population Health, RPMS Core & Data Exchange, and Operations & Maintenance. FY2010 decreased from 124.492 to 109.496 to reflect a revised amount of 14.468 of RPMS ARRA planned expenses in FY2010; 14.996 of ARRA planned expenses moved to the IHS Infrastructure, Office Automation, and Telecommunications (IOAT) investment. FY2011 decreasing from 105.151 to 93.567 based on the removal of 24.307 of unrealized funding, continuation of the FY10 16.251 funding, and 4.000 of security costs shifted to the Security investment, including standard inflation rates. FY2012 increased to 93.567 to reflect the anticipated straight-line funding from FY11 to FY12. FY13-FY15 reflects an increase based on the revised FY2012 budget, plus a standard 2.2% inflation rate. FY16 reflects a continuation of the investment adding 102.077.","","","","1168.797","2016-09-30","08/31/2010","16:09:24","1098"

New development, modernization, or enhancement services and capabilities next year will consist of: improvement of compliance metrics; implementation of enhanced Informational Website; and evaluation of query pricingThis re-baseline will allow the remainder of the 4th Generation NPDB-HIPDB contract and the associated changes to the development lifecycle to operate in an approved manner under a new baseline for this major IT investment.  Because of these changes to the 4th Generation contract, the current approved system baseline needs to be re-baselined to track cost and schedule accurately for the FFP portion as well as the T&M portion of the contract.  Once this occurs then the NPDB-HIPDB Earned Value Management (EVM) monthly status report will illustrate cost and schedule variances that are more realistic and accurate. There is justification for continuation of the investment under the new baseline for the following reasons:1.     The current baseline is inaccurate and requires modification.  The current baseline was established over two years ago and remained within established parameters for that length of time.  As of May 30, 2010, taken as a whole, the project has a cost variance of only -2.64% - well within the allowed 10% variance.  However, due to the recently mandated requirement to track both Steady State (SS) and Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DME) separately, the DME portion has now slightly exceeded the -10% threshold.2.     The current baseline does not include several efforts that were unforeseen at the time the baseline was established.  Of major significance is a security enhancement that was mandated by HRSA after the baseline was in place and therefore was not contained within the budget at that time.  This enhancement, referred to as eAuthentication will provide for a significantly higher level of information security for the system as a whole by validating users at a higher level of assurance.  In addition, unknown at the time of the original baseline was the recently completed change necessitated by the implementation of Section 1921 of the SSA and upcoming changes implementing the merger of HIPDB data into NPDB required by ACA.3.     The NPDB-HIPDB contract has been modified to address these security improvements as well as these legislatively mandated requirements. Under the current contract, the system is continuously enhanced to meet legislative and other Government initiatives that reasonably fit the architecture, including expanding the database to include additional data elements and/or add new reports and client categories and functional enhancements.  All functional enhancements to the NPDB-HIPDB IT investment are logical progressions of the current system and undergo the scrutiny of a documented Configuration Change Management process.  The implementation of these enhancements will provide the following strategic, cost, and technical benefits to the Government and user community: 1. Strategic Benefits:   Improve service levels (i.e. response time, confidentiality, and IT security).   Increase accuracy.   Increase the ability of health care entities to manage risks inherent in their processes to more effectively utilizing the NPDB system. 2. Cost Benefits:   Eliminate or minimize paper forms and other labor-intensive activities.   Eliminate duplication between the Data Banks. 3. Technical Benefits:   NPDB-HIPDB enhancements represent leading edge improvements to health care information systems that will respond to legislative and security requirements, external market conditions, address industry health care accreditation standards and regulations, and provide increased value to its many customers.   The Government is very confident in the contractor's abilities to maintain the system, respond quickly to problems, implement enhancements, and maintain the highest level of security at a reasonable and acceptable cost. Therefore, to reflect the current revised requirements accurately, EVM position, and Summary of Spending of the NPDB-HIPDB IT Investment, it is imperative that the NPDB-HIPDB program re-baseline.","","","","335.214","2016-09-30","08/19/2010","16:13:13","873"

New development, modernization, or enhancement services and capabilities next year will consist of: improvement of compliance metrics; implementation of enhanced Informational Website; and evaluation of query pricingThis re-baseline will allow the remainder of the 4th Generation NPDB-HIPDB contract and the associated changes to the development lifecycle to operate in an approved manner under a new baseline for this major IT investment.  Because of these changes to the 4th Generation contract, the current approved system baseline needs to be re-baselined to track cost and schedule accurately for the FFP portion as well as the T&M portion of the contract.  Once this occurs then the NPDB-HIPDB Earned Value Management (EVM) monthly status report will illustrate cost and schedule variances that are more realistic and accurate. There is justification for continuation of the investment under the new baseline for the following reasons:1.     The current baseline is inaccurate and requires modification.  The current baseline was established over two years ago and remained within established parameters for that length of time.  As of May 30, 2010, taken as a whole, the project has a cost variance of only -2.64% - well within the allowed 10% variance.

However, since the replan included correcting Project data and several Planned and Actual fields, the ITDB schema would only allow this submission to be classified as either a Correction or Rebaseline.  The changes reflected in the project and activities table do not constitute a rebaseline as defined by FAA's baseline management policy.  The program received approval for an extensive replan due to 1) GEO WAAS satellite failure in FY10; 2) regaining control of GEO satellite; 3) return of service in March 2011; 4) underestimation of the scope of work of software development of the G-III reference receiver.  The schedule replan is required to ensure the continuity of current services to WAAS users in concert with the implementation of planned enhancements.  Changes to planned activity completion dates for Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) milestones have been made consistent with the Baseline Management Notice (BMN) briefed to the FAA's Joint Resources Council (JRC) in April 2012.  The updated APB has been signed by Air Traffic's Vice President of Program Management. Completed activities were corrected consistent with the updated APB and to allow future performance to have more meaning for this reporting period. No long term impact on program cost or schedule is anticipated.","1194,1195,1196,1197,1198,1199,1200,1201,1202","Projects, Activities","","","","05/31/2012","15:21:55","8343"

The adjustments in processes and release content are expected to minimize any downstream impact on cost or schedule.  There will be no long term impacts because of these delays.

As part of sound project management, planned costs for TMA Activities are risk-adjusted.  Risks for a number of Activites completed to date in FY12 did not materialize, and so these Activities were completed well below their Planned Cost.  This unused risk reserve was allocated to future Projects/Activities based on increased risks from interdependencies with external programs.

A baseline decision took place in January 2010 and was already reflected in the OMB Dashboard and in the BY 2011 Post Passback Exhibit 300 submission.  RWSL completed a JRC approved re-baseline in January 2010 that resulted in slight scope and funding changes. The RWSL Program received an Initial Investment Decision on July 18, 2007 from the FAA's Joint Resources Council (JRC). On June 25, 2008 the program received a conditional Final Investment Decision to procure and install systems at 22 airports and 3 support sites (2nd level engineering Program Support Facility, FAA Depot, and FAA Academy).  The conditional FID included approval to proceed with a prime contract award with a lifecycle cost baseline of $247.7M in F&E and $4.3M in Ops and a schedule baseline of FY08 to FY12. The JRC granted a FID to the RWSL program, on January 20, 2010, with a revised lifecycle cost baseline of  $367.7M in F&E and 105.5M in Ops, and a revised schedule baseline out to  FY16.

During the development of BY2013 E300 Process, CDX set a Planned Budget which was reviewed and approved by OEI IMO and EPA CPIC Offices and submitted to OMB. However, due to agency budget changes, the available budget for CDX BY2013 activities was reduced drastically from the Planned Budget. Continuing Resolutions delayed the release of the final Enacted Budget numbers preventing CDX from revising the Exhibit 300 during the available resubmission windows. This has resulted in CDX reporting monthly against the higher Planned Budget amounts. CDX requests initiation of re-baseline in order to align Planned costs for Project Activities with the revised Enacted budget. CDX will complete this re-baseline by updating the Project Activities Table in eCPIC with revised estimates for Planned and Projected Costs. Current Planned Costs, which were derived from the Planned Budget, will be downwardly revised proportional to the reduction in available funds issued in the Enacted Budget. These changes will be made simultaneously with the July 2012 IT Dashboard Update.","1543,1544","Projects, Activities","2001-2017","","","07/31/2012","12:08:28","8795"

The new baseline is needed to correct a life cycle cost error and adjust milestones due to a change in scope. O&M costs were understated for FY2014 through FY2017 by $20.1M. The EPA major system, Superfund Document Management System (SDMS), is being integrated into SEMS a year sooner than originally planned. The change impacts project cost and schedule, resulting in an earned value variance greater than five percent. Through the rebaselining, SEMS will realign milestones to better represent enhanced requirements definition for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) integration portion of the effort. This will result in a more streamlined development process. Funding adjustments correlate to the changes of schedule as the overall project costs are estimated in more detail. The rebaseline reflects a significant alteration to the scope of the SEMS project by accelerating the schedule to integrate a major subsystem, the SDMS into the SEMS a year sooner than originally planned, from FY2011 to FY2010. Project costs will show an increase for the reasons stated in the change rationale. Systems operation and maintenance costs were calculated inaccurately for FY2014   2017 in the previous business case submission and have been updated. The rebaseline will not affect the final planned delivery date of SEMS. There are realignments to the project milestones which will better integrate project scope. The SEMS schedule is changing in two ways. First, the integration of the SDMS major system is being advanced by one year to occur completely within 2010. Second, SDMS milestones are being combined into the Operations and Maintenance milestone of SEMS. Even though portions of the schedule are being advanced, the overall development portion of the project holds to the same completion date in 2013. Realignments of milestone dates and funding will permit a smoother transition forward on a project that is accelerating key subsystem integrations.","","","","58.943973","2017-09-30","03/09/2011","11:40:42","3751"

The previous scheduled planning period was used to select 10 high priority, high use data sources and a suite of analytic capabilities for Increment 1.  Increment 1 is now underway and is scheduled to go active during the first quarter of FY 2011.  This new effort required the diversion of $6.21M in hardware and additional personnel who normally support tactical response developments to this more strategic effort.  STAO also realigned other resources from other programs to support this new effort.  Because DIVS is a level-of-effort, government-led, government-contractor team program, additional financial resources are expected to be added to DIVS to maintain the pace of future data aggregation, provide sufficient storage capability, and maintain user expected system performance.  These changes will be shown in subsequent reports.  The program office is also developing plans for future increments, future functionality, requirements and risk managment processes, future infrastructure needs, cost estimates, and future system deactivations.  These plans will provide greater clarity during FY 2011.  This DIVS scope change is one of data and data source magnitude.  The purpose of DIVS is unchanged-store FBI lawfully obtained data and present that data  to authorized users via web-based software analytic applications.  OMB personnel were briefed on these changes on May 4 and 7 with a planned follow-on review in October 2010.","","","","289.1028","2015-09-30","06/01/2010","14:48:14","687"

This is part of the evolving design solution to accommodate larger amounts of data as more data sets are added to the system.  This monthly assessment also shows the $5M expected from the FY 2010 Supplemental and will be used for additional Storage Area Network (SAN) hardware to accommodate larger storage needs as the project goes forward.  All funding additions reflect scope change due to Presidential Memorandum and Director's decision to aggregate and federate all FBI investigative and intelligence data in DIVS. (NOTE:  DIVS is a level of effort costed program.  Also note that original baseline only captured contractor labor costs.  Requirements changes dictated the need o reflect hardware additions as a result of the change and not normal data growth, which reflected in O&M accounting).","","","","291.1748","2015-09-30","06/16/2010","14:41:16","719"

On August 3rd, DOJ approved an enhancement to the DIVS budget of $16.5M and 10 government positions to handle future needs and accelerate system build-up (more data sets and functionality faster). This new baseline reflects current planning and the new proposed funding, pending OMB and Congressional approvals. The planning period to define future increments is underway. FBI executive management is reviewing FY 2011 target content for DIVS in terms of new data sets and analytic functionality releases that can be accomplished within current funding over the next 12 months. DIVS will be planned, developed, and implemented incrementally with a 6-12 month window of in scope requirements for subsequent increments. Since DIVS is an operational mission support system, actual program content and accomplishments will evolve in response to threats, resource availability, technology, and user defined requirements and priorities. Funding and schedules will be adjusted as system solution discoveries are made and executive decisions on program content and resource needs are made. DIVS is following a dynamic and evolutionary development strategy-dynamic because the emphasis is on rapid capability improvements in response to various and evolving threats to national security. The fundamental purpose and scope remains unchanged; execution details will change (funding and milestones) to meet emerging needs. FBI leadership now desires quarterly releases and progress reviews, thus milestones will be adjusted once the corresponding dates ae determined.","","","","540.656","2016-09-30","09/16/2010","16:55:51","1318"

As a result, milestone number 84 N-DEx Increment 3 4th Material Order, was deleted and set to Omit Synchronization in the FITDB.  The amount of this milestone was $1,159,000, and while we had applied an estimated actual cost to this milestone, no payment had been expended.

This milestone planned cost increased from $425,000 reported in the February FITDB to $1,491,000 in March.

As a result, the FRBR lost 13 staff members on the ASAP investment in operations and development (53% of developers, 50% of operations and development testers, and 100% of IT specialized resources).  This significant external event impacted ASAP's ability to deliver scope within the time frames and costs published internally to approving governance boards and externally in the Ex. 300b.  Additionally, the abrupt loss of development staff forced ASAP to immediately change its development strategy in order to meet future Enterprise Architecture and Mainframe Migration deadlines.  EA and MM development work will be combined into one DME stream to take best advantage of remaining resources and known efficiencies.  This correction BCR is to bring the Ex. 300b baseline in-line with the reduction in staff and changes to ASAP's development strategy to meet critical deadlines.

However, the EVM trend information has indicated that select projects are trending towards exceeding those thresholds. FinCEN performed an internal program review and confirmed that the BSA IT Mod technical architecture remains sound. However, based on the detailed projects review and lessons learned, there needs to be some schedule adjustments and cost realignment. One key lesson learned that is causing some of the milestones to be extended is moving from a waterfall approach to testing to a more iterative approach. FinCEN is now designing/building the system of record by BSA form then performing unit test on each form type before developing the next form. This iterative approach in the development and testing will help ensure all the business rules and data mapping is done correctly prior to data conversion.  Because of the dependency on the system of record, the Query system milestone has also shifted by two months, plus the project requires additional time to build a staging area to load all of the BSA data prior to populating the Query system. E-filing Release 2 has been broken up into three iterations, with the first being complete in December with the final dynamic or wizard version of the new SAR and CTR being complete in June 2012. The three projects that make up the Broker Information Exchange capabilities (Financial Intelligence Repository, Contact/Customer Management, and 314b) have been combined into one milestone because they will most likely share the same technology platform.  Moreover, the milestone date has shifted by one quarter in FY13 because of the budget allocation by fiscal year.Another reason for the BCR is to realign costs.  Some milestones have been complete and came in under cost, so these costs have been shifted to other, ongoing projects. Also, after a year into the Program, further cost estimating has been performed and subsequent refinements need to be made. However, there is no overall increase in the investment dollars.","","","","250.323213","2020-04-30","07/20/2011","16:13:33","6421"

Since May 2010, the overall Program has stayed green per Treasury schedule and cost reporting and within the 10% earned value threshold for FinCEN's cost and schedule reporting. FinCEN has completed 18 individual milestone projects, which has provided a new technical architecture and systems foundation.There is one remaining, active FY2013 project, which is to provide broker information exchange capabilities and this baseline change request (BCR) is to adjust the planned cost and schedule for this remaining effort. The requirements for the remaining DME project are tightly integrated with FinCEN's organization structure and work processes and as a result, the reorganization efforts FinCEN is currently undergoing has had an impact on the final completion date of the initial release of functionality.  These delays are necessary to allow users  to  focus their primary attention on higher priority transition team activities rather than being able to participate fully in the necessary requirements/design sessions.  In addition, the resulting transition activities will have an impact on the final organization structure, which will also require a revalidation of the current release requirements.  FinCEN is requesting this BCR to incorporate the additional time needed to capture requirements that will reflect the needs of the new organization and build in the time necessary to manage the project in parallel with FinCEN's organizational change efforts. The scope for the Broker Information Exchange project milestone originally included the full suite of capabilities to begin creating/managing/storing project work items, building a contact/customer management system, and streamlining the process for financial institutions to collaborate/share information.  As part of this BCR, FinCEN is now planning to split the original project into two releases. The first release will focus on implementing the technical Sharepoint foundation for this project and implementing functionality to first support investigative cases, which constitute roughly 85 percent of FinCEN work items and processing.   The second release will focus on delivering the information exchange functions and capabilities needed to support the remaining FinCEN processes.

FinCEN has completed 18 individual milestone projects, which has provided a new technical architecture and systems foundation.There is one remaining, active FY2013 project, which is to provide broker information exchange capabilities and this baseline change request (BCR) is to adjust the planned cost and schedule for this remaining effort. The requirements for the remaining DME project are tightly integrated with FinCEN's organization structure and work processes and as a result, the reorganization efforts FinCEN is currently undergoing has had an impact on the final completion date of the initial release of functionality.  These delays are necessary to allow users  to  focus their primary attention on higher priority transition team activities rather than being able to participate fully in the necessary requirements/design sessions.  In addition, the resulting transition activities will have an impact on the final organization structure, which will also require a revalidation of the current release requirements.  FinCEN is requesting this BCR to incorporate the additional time needed to capture requirements that will reflect the needs of the new organization and build in the time necessary to manage the project in parallel with FinCEN's organizational change efforts. The scope for the Broker Information Exchange project milestone originally included the full suite of capabilities to begin creating/managing/storing project work items, building a contact/customer management system, and streamlining the process for financial institutions to collaborate/share information.  As part of this BCR, FinCEN is now planning to split the original project into two releases. The first release will focus on implementing the technical Sharepoint foundation for this project and implementing functionality to first support investigative cases, which constitute roughly 85 percent of FinCEN work items and processing.   The second release will focus on delivering the information exchange functions and capabilities needed to support the remaining FinCEN processes.

This results in the depositing of funds in the Treasury. The Gateway replaces a number of unnecessarily duplicative solutions in favor of a single, dedicated application. In so doing, the Debit Gateway benefits agencies by providing better service, and benefits FMS by doing so at a reduced cost. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) operates the Debit Gateway as Fiscal Agent.The Debit Gateway relies on commercial off-the-shelf software from the vendor U.S. Dataworks as its core. Custom code allows this COTS product to support Treasury's unique collection. Core maintenance and custom code development are currently the vendor's responsibility under contract to FRBC. In response to the vendor's financial difficulties (and, secondarily, concerns with the vendor's custom code development performance), the decision was taken in January 2012 to transition development responsibility to FRBC over a 12-18 month period. This transition will result in increased costs in FY12 and FY13 as FRBC adds resources, but ultimately produce savings once completed due to lower resource costs vs. the current vendor. Current baseline and proposed Debit Gateway lifecycle costs ($ mil.):FY12 $11.721, Proposed $12.393, Change +5.7%; FY13 $10.743, Proposed $11.790, Change +9.8%; FY14 $10.553, Proposed $9.932, Change -5.9%; FY15 $11.065, Proposed $10.546, Change -4.7%; FY16 $11.213, Proposed $9.474, Change -15.5%; FY17 $10.586, Proposed $9.572, Change -9.6%; FY18 $10.012, Proposed $9.282, Change -7.3%. Total FY12-18: $75.893, Proposed $72.990, Change -3.8%.A delay in implementing R1.4 (Adjustments, Corrections & Reversals) due to a high number of defects in vendor-delivered code has resulted in a need to delay the start and implementation of R1.5 (NACHA Rules). Delaying R1.5 permits full resource concentration on R1.4 defect correction in order to implement in production by 6-30-12. Further, the schedule for R1.6 (EFTPS) in FY13 will also change as a result before getting back to the planned schedules for Releases 1.7 (Same-day ACH processing) and 1.8 (Straight-through processing).","3251,2745","Projects, Activities","2008-2018","","","07/31/2012","23:11:02","8857"

The ISRP workstation refresh was authorized, funded and initiated last June (2010) and completed in December 2010. Due to a variety of reasons, ISRP was initially confined to reporting the FY10 costs of the Workstation Refresh against the existing FY10 Operations and Maintenance milestone, and the residual FY11 costs against the existing FY11 Operations and Maintenance milestone until such time as the new Workstation Refresh milestone could be added to the milestone plan in February 2011. By then, ISRP was locked into adding the new milestone reflecting the full, original estimated cost even though most of the actual costs had already been expended and reported in FY10. Once the Workstation Refresh BCR was uploaded to the OMB IT Dashboard in February 2011, ISRP reduced its FY11 Operations and Maintenance milestone actual costs by the amount that had been expended this FY on the workstation refresh and reported those costs ($218,496) against the newly added Workstation Refresh milestone. The changes being made with this correction BCR (a) correct (reduce) the actual costs of the FY10 Operations and Maintenance milestone by the amount of the FY10 workstation refresh actuals, (b) corrects the Workstation Refresh start dates, and (c) corrects the total actual cost and the actual percent complete for the Workstation Refresh milestone.","","","","241.944","2017-09-30","05/13/2011","14:40:49","6016"

Last summer when we were building our BY13 Exhibit 300 (E300), there was uncertainty as to how ACA was going to work. Our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) organization issued control charts that did not contain ACA funding saying FY2012 and FY2013 do not include ACA since we do not have the status/treatment of that program at this time. ISRP expected to do some work in support of ACA and, with the expectation they would be receiving ACA funding at some point, we created a $20K place-holder project in our E300 for ACA-related tax form changes. Then, this past January (2012), our CFO issued updated control charts depicting ACA funding being pulled out from various Exhibit 53 line items and consolidated under ACA with a transmittal message saying that the ACA funding was being consolidated. Once we realized that ISRP was not going to receive any ACA funding, the ACA place holder project in ISRP's E300 should have been removed. Based on this explanation, ISRP is now seeking Treasury's support for this Correction BCR to remove the ACA project from ISRP's baseline. We need to get this processed before our BY14 E300s are submitted to OMB so that this project isn't erroneously perpetuated in ISRP's baseline next year.","2776","Projects, Activities","","","","08/29/2012","16:00:33","9045"

We did so based on instruction to include at least 1 project in our E300 even though, at the time, we had no basis for estimating the cost of the work that was to be based on legislation that hadn't yet been issued. ISRP's legislative updates evolve into work requests only after our business partners evaluate the legislation and determine what changes need to be made. The business then submits WRs to ISRP and ISRP submits them to its contractor who subsequently provides a cost estimate for the work. If we don't know what work needs to be done, much less how much it's going to cost, we shouldn't have established a place holder project in last year's E300, and certainly not in this year's E300.Since that time, Treasury has conceded that place holder projects should not have been included in our baseline and we should have established this project only after the legislation was issued and we had meaningful basis for estimating the cost and timing of the work.   With that background in mind, this baseline change seeks to (1) delete the Late 2012 Legislative WR activity, (2) correct the planned amount and timing of the Timely 2012 Legislative WR activity, and (3) delete the Legislative Tax Form Changes project for Filing Season 2014 since it represents a place holder that should not have been included in the recent E300 submission. We will add a Filing Season 2014 Legislative Tax Form Changes project next summer after we know what work needs to be done and how much it's going to cost. In conclusion, this correction BCR is being submitted based on guidance from Treasury regarding placeholders and the need to reflect accurate planning and performance.","3319,675","Projects, Activities","1998-2019","","","12/13/2012","12:50:35","11581"

Reason for Baseline Change:  The business need for this interim BCR centers around changes in requirements and scope experienced during Production Release (PR) 3.0 including: 1) deferring the Office of Personal Management (OPM) payments from PR 3.0 and replacing with daily payments that include travel, salary and vendor, 2) changes to the Business Process Model implemented in PAM to support the variations needed for daily payments and the new standard input file format, 3) a mandate to implement certificate requirements to support Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2), 4) development of post PR 3.0 roadmap to align with key Treasury initiatives,  5) the decision to move the application development/maintenance to the FRB resulting in the termination of  knowledge transfer activities, and 6) reporting requirements detailed in OMB M-10-25, Reforming the Federal Government's Efforts to Manage Information Technology Projects.FMS anticipates submitting another BCR within 6 to 8 months due to a possible mandate to agencies to use a standard format that will position agencies to accommodate Government Wide Accounting reporting requirements (Treasury Account Symbol/Business Event Type Code) on their detail payment records. Additionally, FMS has finalized a decision to re-purpose the Austin Financial Center (AFC) into a Debt Management Operations Center.  This will result in redistributing the AFC payment workload to the remaining three Regional Financial Centers. In addition, the inclusion of the TOP Control System (TCS) re-write effort as part of the Operation and Maintenance of RO Legacy Applications will impact the current baseline. Finally, Information Resources' (IR's) availability to support a needed upgrade of the existing DataStage product may present impacts as well due to competing  priorities and the impending release of plans for the Regional Operations Center (ROC) relocations and other Fiscal IT issues. Current vs. New Functionality:The Payment Automation Manager (PAM) application provides functionality for processing Treasury Disbursed Office (TDO) payments on behalf of FMS and Federal Program Agencies (FPAs).","","","","190.099598","2016-08-31","02/16/2011","13:33:20","2820"

In order for PAM to be ready for the SSA and IRS transition, additional functionality that was not planned in FY 2012/2013 must now be included.  To accommodate the additions to scope, functionality originally planned must be deferred to a release beyond 2012.Implement RAD in FY 2013.  This causes a change in milestone naming convention and release schedule dates.Current vs. New Functionality:   Current PAM functionality allows agencies to send check and ACH payment requests in a standard format for IAT, PPD and CCD+ payments. PAM is a configurable application that allows the addition of the majority of agencies to process payments without making programming changes to the application.  PAM functionality will continue to be developed and implemented to meet the mandate to have functionality in place to accommodate GWA TAS/BETC reporting completed by the end of CY 2012.New 2012 functionality not in current baseline consists of 1) Generic Types of Payment Configuration Changes; 2) OFAC Screening for International Direct Deposits; 3) Agency Notification configuration moved to the RFC, Agency, and Type of Payment; 4) SSA Notification of check/Trace Numbers; 5) Redirection of Foreign Certifications to ITS.gov; 6) Debt Screening; and 7) Configure file size for TOP.Current vs. Proposed Schedule:Currently, the PAM baseline has DME activity ending on June 28, 2013 and Operation and Maintenance releases concluding on May 2, 2014. With the approval of this BCR, DME activity will be extended out to November 7, 2015. The extended development time will enable PAM to implement the additional functionality it needs to meet the new scope of the project.

Providing print images to Revenue Agents (RA) and Taxpayer Service Representatives (TSR) supports IRS's Strategic Goal to enforce the law to ensure everyone meets their obligation to pay taxes.  RA's and TSR's need access to taxpayer documents, 721,825,639 of which are stored in the SCRIPS Archive Database as of 12/31/2012.  Providing the images via requests from the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) allows SCRIPS to help the IRS meet that goal.  It is also an excellent measure of the health of the SCRIPS system and its ability to accurately store, index, and retrieve taxpayer submissions.  The aforementioned changes are also due, in part, because the Docs-Per-Hour metric is difficult to compute and predict, and further complicated by a seasonal complexity.","","Metrics","1993-2019","","","02/05/2013","14:26:00","12139"

This change in acquisition strategy has also resulted in changes in the Project and Acquisition Management Plans, which have been adjusted to reflect the additional time needed to adequately address the milestone changes that have occurred. The Health Claims Data Warehouse (HCDW) is currently in the final planning phase of the acquisition lifecycle, and continues to develop requirements. The scope expansion necessitates the continued re-analysis of risk and requires the program to rebaseline.  HCDW is working to become part of the OIG s FEHBP Data Warehouse and will utilize their existing architecture and technology standards. This change will lower the overall development costs through the use of shared resources and processes and should result in a more reliable product because proven processes will be used. The project team continues to coordinate closely with the CIO's staff to ensure appropriate compliance. This Program is in its infancy and has an inherent level of uncertainty and high level of future development.     The HCDW revised system of records notice (SORN) internal and external review period has been lengthy resulting in a delay to continue the acquisition process, which impacts all future milestones. The HCDW Project remains on hold pending OMB and OPM Director approval of the revised SORN.  OPM first published a system of records notice pertaining to the Health Claims Data Warehouse on October 5, 2010 with the comment period closing November 15, 2010.  On November 15, 2010, OPM extended the comment period to December 15, 2010 and indicated its intent to modify certain aspects of the system of records notice.  On December 15, 2010, OPM published a notice closing the comment period and announced that a revised notice would be published. The revised SORN is currently under review by OMB and HHS. It is anticipated that the revised SORN will be published in the Federal Register sometime March 2011.The revised baseline more accurately represents a realistic and achievable set of milestones.  Additional milestones will be added following completion of the acquisition lifecycle.","","","","29364.3084","2016-09-30","02/28/2011","21:18:39","3731"

OPM used a separate Earned Value Management (EVM) tool and process to closely manage investments that spend money in development of new functionality.  The FY2011 Continuing Resolution has impacted EHRI customer agencies' ability to fund new eOPF implementations under EHRI's fee-for-service funding model. As a result, several agencies that were planned for FY2011 have not moved forward and have to be removed from EHRI's baseline.  These agencies include the Department of Defense, Department of Interior, and the Department of the Treasury.Also, under review is EHRI's funding for the Data Warehouse (DW). Historically, the steady state milestone covering DW hosting, operations and maintenance was aligned with EHRI's appropriation. This re-baseline event, however, brings the DW hosting, operations and maintenance milestone in line with the program's EVM baseline.The impact of Agencies not implementing eOPF in FY11 is decreased planned costs in the following milestones:Fee-for-Service - FY2011 Hosting, Operations and MaintenanceFee-for-Service - FY2011 eOPF Implementation -  DoD (partial), Treasury (partial)Fee-for-Service - FY2011 ePower LicensesThe planned cost for the Data Warehouse Production Operations and Maintenance FY2011 milestone is now aligned with EHRI's EVM baseline.

This rebaseline is a correction to the previous 3/1/2011 rebaseline that was to change the funding strategy.                                                     The purpose of this BCR is twofold. First, it brings EHRI's Information Technology (IT) Dashboard milestones in line with its existing Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 earned value management (EVM) baseline. Second, it revises EHRI's FYI2 milestones to be consistent with the Program's Budget Year 2012 appropriated funding passback from the Office of Management & Budget (OMB). These changes do not reflect problems with the investment.                                             The overall impact of this change is to add the initial baseline to the Dashboard and to make reductions to the EHRI spending because EHRI has not received funding from the partner agencies for the associated eOPF implementations, there have been no commitments made by EHRI to any partner agency or contractor. If the partner agencies are unable to secure funding for the eOPF project in the next several months, it will present challenges to both EHRI and partner agencies in meeting stated OPM and OMB performance goals. Additionally, delays in funding may force EHRI scanning vendors to close their facilities and lay off their employees.","","","","370.38219","2012-09-30","05/16/2011","12:21:49","6017"

Several planned start dates have been changed to align with actual task order or contract award dates that were modified to accurately reflect procurement timelines.More specifically, Counterparty Management project activities are being realigned and expanded to support potential decommissioning of legacy systems.Deployment of Federal Financial Services Platform (FFSP) - Infrastructure GEN2 activities have been deleted as these functions will be transferred to HUD OCIO as part of the existing HITS infrastructure contract.An additional project activity has been added for the Physical Inspections Alignment initiative while consolidating phases of the original alignment project.Activities for the Healthcare project have been consolidated with the MFH Automated Underwriting System due to similar project requirements.

Overall, the reduced funding amount in FY2013 will significantly extend the program completion date thus limiting FHA's ability to leverage the initial investment made to obtain a modern technology platform to support migration of legacy systems and applications.","2950,1117","Projects, Activities","2010-2018","","","03/29/2013","15:36:02","12923"

This provides cost avoidance and economies of scale.  Often, these services are agreed to after the budget submission, which means our revenue (and thus our costs) increase.  To provide accurate reporting, we need to rebaseline each year, based on previous years' W2s for each bureau or agency.  Additionally, the WCF Consortium usually does not make its decisions until after Exhibit 300 submission deadlines, causing disconnects.   FY10:  Anticipated revenue and customers for DME did not materialize. Department requested NBC concentrate on current offerings.  DME planned baseline is less; SS is a bit higher.FY11:  Additional services but budget cut by Department.

This new timeline, coordinated with the FAA provides adequate time for the FAA to finalize their system development for their IOC, which is also delayed until March 2016.Funding appropriated and approved in FY12 and FY13, respectively, represents a reduction of approximately 50% from planned program funding.  This reduction prevents NOAA from progressing towards meeting objectives for improved weather data and accuracy by postponing investments in improved numerical modeling and statistical guidance, weather research and development, human forecast tools, and forecast performance assessment.  In addition, there will be less investment and progress towards enhancing the consistency of weather forecast information through implementation of a single authoritative source capability.

This will allow for the standardization of the CBS operating system and hardware platform.  In 2005, the CBS Executive Board conducted a business case and initiated a CBS consolidation effort to standardize the CBS technology platform, including efforts to co-locate the CBS and its associated environments at a single location, the Census Data Center (CDC) in 2008.  However, this project was redirected as a result of changes in the Census Bureau s priorities due to unforeseen issues with the Decennial Census.  Several decennial systems were moved to the CDC resulting in a power supply issue that forced the CBS servers to move out of the CDC.   As a result, the bureaus stopped their migration efforts and reverted back to their respective data centers using their current infrastructures that were near the end of life and/or capacity.  For example, two bureaus (Census and NOAA) reverted back to operating on Tru64 Operating Systems for Alpha Server Platforms and HP support ends in December 2012.  If the equipment and operating system is not purchased, there will be a significant impact on the continuity of operations for DOC s financial system, significantly increase the risk of system interruption and security exposure over time.","","","","526.703182","2012-09-30","11/24/2010","09:17:27","2343"

For all HEARTH-eGrants projects, a new contract award for executing these projects was protested in June 2012. This required significant re-plan within the portfolio. The protest was resolved in November 2012 and a new award was made. At that time the Investment Manager learned for the first time the details of the new contract ceiling, which is now controlled annually at the system level instead of the portfolio level. In many cases this ceiling structure conflicted with and would not support the planned cost of projects in this Investment. Therefore resources and scope for the projects had to be realigned within the portfolio in order to work within these constraints. Additional rationale for re-baseline varies by Project:Energy and Performance Information Center (EPIC) Spring 2013 Release 3, eGrants-eSnaps System Release #2: Scope and Objective evolve due to iterative system development. This project has been re-planned under a managed change control process. Hearth-eGrants-GMP System Release #1 and Hearth-eGrants-IDIS System Release #2: Adding detail within overall Cost and Schedule goals. These projects may now be decomposed to a finer level of detail to show milestones or Usable Functionalities, along with associated Costs and Schedule. Hearth-eGrants-eSnaps System Release #1: Modifying detail within overall Cost and Schedule goals. During the course of iterative software development, two Usable Functionalities were removed from scope under managed change control process, and the plan updated / project re-baselined. Specifically, these two functionalities could not be completed due to pending OMB approval of HEARTH Competitive Homeless assistance grant regulations. These factors are outside of HUD s control. Hearth-eGrants-GMP System Release #2, Hearth-eGrants-IDIS System Release #3, and Hearth-eGrants-eSnaps System Release #3: Scope and Cost evolve due to iterative system development, and due to Significant Contract change (see contract ceiling discussion above). Specifically, HUD must decrease planned scope and budgets on these three projects and redistribute resources within the portfolio to accommodate the funding limits defined by the contract ceilings for each of these three systems.","6629,5081,5083,5085,5087,5089,5093,5095,5097,5099,5101,5103,5105,5107","Projects, Activities","2011-2020","","","03/29/2013","15:35:43","12919"

To avoid any potential risk related to FACTS Info's scalability, the FACTS Program will initiate a next generation project in FY13. This next generation system will be more flexible and scalable in order to adapt to the changing requirements of foreign assistance budgeting.  FACTS is looking to utilize the cloud's infrastructure-as-a-service model in the next generation. Development of the next generation system is currently scheduled from FY13-FY16.  FACTS Info will run in tandem with the next generation system. As modules are deployed in the new system, they will be shut down in FACTS Info.

Added historical (Project ID 7312M1100) and future (Project IDs 7312M1103 and 7312M1104) projects so that eCPIC reflects the full scope of the FSMS Planning and DME from 2003 to 2015. Reduced planned cost of Project ID 7312M1101 by 10.4K, and reduced planned cost of Project ID 7312M1102 by 86.998K to reflect adjustments made as a result of the 2012 Independent Government Cost Estimate.

With the cancellation of the Corrections and Adjustment project in February, 2012, all future activities for Corrections and Adjustment project have been deactivated and focus has shifted to optimization and conversion needs. The shift in focus have resulted in reallocation of some 2012 and 2013 DME buget to O&M. Also, several Agencies have expressed a strong interest in entering C-Key information at the summary level of check processing for end of day processing to be fully compliant with government wide accounting requirement by 2014 that has resulted in the addition of the Dynamic Split project.","3253","Projects, Activities","2009-2019","","","07/31/2012","23:11:09","8859"

Archiving and architectural changes became a critical need to minimize operational risk of the system by creating an Archive database and separating Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)  from historical information. Archiving Project is broken up into Phase 1 for Check Processing and Phase 2 for Deposit Processing and Reports. Supporting Straight through Processing became a priority as it will provide an improved cash position for the Treasury on a daily basis through a streamlined Routing Transit Number (RTN) process. OTCnet has a number of changes to support this project including reporting Treasury RTN numbers, identifiying NAF RTN number and processing adjustment/corrections and rescinds  (ACRs) from Debit Gateway. STP Changes will support FRB CashLink decommissioning. STP project will also be broken up in 2 segments: near term and full solution with ACR processing.

Therefore, it is estimated that this project will be delayed until FY13.- Removed DME 4 - Contract Writing System - The contract for the new Procurement Contract Writing System was awarded to our current vendor (Compusearch).  Therefore, the milestone for transitioning to a new procurement/contract writing system is no longer required.- Added a Consolidated DME as these components are being managed as one project which includes:  a. DME 1 (R12)  b. DME 3 (Oracle Projects Module)  c. Removed costs associated with US Mint core financial system upgrade to R-12 due to customer requested delay.  d. Added estimated costs associated with US Mint SaaS project integration.In addition, the reductions to the original DME#1 reflects a delay in the US Mint instance upgrade due to a new US Mint priority (the US Mint has requested our assistance in integrating a new Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) solution for their Integrated Retail Information System (IRIS) with our Oracle E-Business Suite).  This was identified by US Mint as their highest priority and thus we have delayed upgrading their core financial system until this project is completed (currently expecting FY13).","2913","Projects, Activities, Metrics","2010-2020","","","02/13/2012","14:40:13","7362"

These events along with the DHS requirements for shorter, more descriptive milestones left us with the opportunity to make changes that would not only be easier to track due to shorter milestone lengths but also much easier for the Project Managers to determine the dollar allocations toward milestones on their projects based on the contract fiscal year.  The PMO support team also discovered financial data that had not been incorporated into actuals for closed milestones from 2008/2009.  This required the modification of planned and actual dollars for milestone #1. The modifications made caused minimal change in the overall scope of CAII and its projects, no change in the overall planned dollar for the full lifecycle of the program occurred, and there were minimal schedule changes on the individual project level. A few reasons for the rebaseline:- The development of ACRIMe release 2.0 has fallen behind.  Due to this schedule delay ACRIMe has modified their mix of resource and the deliverables have changed or been extended.  - Secure Communities priorities have focused SDS resources to work on ACRIMe development deliverables.  This has caused the SDS dates and costs to be slightly re-planned.  - ATP milestone descriptions were changed to allow the PM to easily and accurately report on all costs.","","","","96.928","2018-09-30","02/24/2011","08:47:48","3134"
"024-000005395","836","024","Department of Homeland Security","ICE - Criminal Alien Identification Initiatives (CAII)","01/20/2012","Rebaseline - other","Over the last several months, ICE/OCIO has been instituting changes to the ACRIMe Modernization project to counter significant issues in requirements gathering, poor developer performance and inadequate contract control and project management processes that have led to schedule and cost overruns. OCIO has assigned new project and portfolio managers in the last 12 months, has hired a new development contractor and strengthened contract controls. The ACRIMe Modernization project has also shifted its development methodology from a waterfall to Agile methodology, co-locating system users with developers leading to direct interaction that is key to proper product development. Functionality is being built in much smaller modules, leading to a vastly increased number of releases. A much tighter relationship with the business owner has led to a reprioritization of the releases, enabling the ACRIMe project to provide greater business value earlier than initially planned. To assist with greater flexibility in development of both the ACRIMe and Status Determination Services projects, ICE/OCIO is in the process of developing new contract vehicles that will enable it to more rapidly issue short task orders to develop modules of the larger applications. Delays in the procurement process have added to the schedule overruns, necessitating additional slippage in the overall ACRIMe Project schedule. The schedules initially placed into the project execution tab were the best plan available when the CAII OMB 300 schedule was developed. The changes made reflect changes in project prioritization, functionality needs, and expectations of contract vehicle availability. Even though project schedules have been extended, overall costs are expected to remain within +/-8% of original estimates, largely due to shorter development cycles and savings generated through tighter integration of developers with business users.","55,57,56","Projects, Activities, Metrics","2008-2018","","","02/26/2012","09:16:16","7498"

"027-000000052","872","027","Office of Personnel Management","USA Staffing System","02/27/2011","Rebaseline - change in funding strategy","The USA Staffing Program requests approval to change the IT Investment baseline for USA Staffing to ensure that the cost, milestones and performance measures most precisely reflect future plans.  This change in baseline will best reflect the direction of the USA Staffing program based on the most recent trends in Federal hiring, the latest information about customer needs, and growth in the USA Staffing customer base.  The FY12-FY16 cost projections have increased to reflect a growing USA Staffing customer base.  The USA Staffing program has seen unprecedented growth within its customer base over the last year.  In FY11, USA Staffing expanded it scope to include an enterprise-wide agreement with the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.  In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs expanded its use of USA Staffing to include Merit Promotion Hiring.  As a result, USA Staffing is processing between 500,000 to 600,000 employment applications each month.  This growth in the USA Staffing program necessitates broader SS activities in FY12 and beyond to ensure sufficient infrastructure to support a government-wide customer base.  The Exhibit 300 was updated to reallocate DME costs to SS to more accurately reflect the nature of operation and maintenance activities.  USA Staffing is a mature, stable system that is fully operational within 51 Federal agencies.  The USA Staffing system has maintained continuous operability, availability, and cost-recovery status for more than 10 years.  The changes were made to reflect a greater understanding within the USA Staffing Program Office on regulations and policies within Exhibit 300 and Exhibit 53.  The changes are a more accurate picture of our current state and contain metrics that are more appropriate and consistent with DME and SS operations for a mature system fully operational system.  The changes also reflect the need to build infrastructure overtime to adequately support a significant expansion of the USA Staffing customer base. With an expanded customer base, USA Staffing is able to further distribute its fixed costs creating government-wide efficiencies and cost savings.  As a result, USA Staffing will retain its current pricing in FY12. There are no contract implications associated with the rebaseline as USA Staffing is managed primarily with Federal employees and individual contractors.  USA Staffing revolving fund agreements will cover all planned expenses. ","","","","179.027","2016-09-30","02/27/2011","11:21:18","3532"

After the initial NSI baseline was submitted, further internal review resulted in additional supplemental and MGE costs being re-allocated to the NSI budget, to properly report them as IT expenses. This major increase resulted in significant changes to the estimated costs for many NSI milestones. Additional changes from the initial baseline include: (1) reducing FTE costs to account for a Congressional decision to freeze pay for federal workers in FY 11 and FY12, and (2) adding milestones for prior year programs that were not included in the initial baseline, but have incurred expenses in FY 11 that need to be reported.","","","","1584.399118","2017-09-30","02/17/2011","16:51:54","2881"

We chose to extend deployment to alleviate the impacts to our users rather than impact them with multiple changes all at once.  In the future, we will ensure that there is limited overlap between projects that affect the user community directly and allow for significantly more time when deploying functionality directly to them.  We held a bureau level TechStat on February 22, 2012, which identified the following issues in our planning process:-We realized the complexity of OTS integration as it became more apparent that the dates for deploying Blackberry devices and MIPS had to be moved out to accommodate higher priority integration issues.  We learned that going forward we will need to add additional time to our project plan for projects dealing with end user groups.  -Brief multiple integration stakeholders early in the project planning process to discuss similar projects across ITS to promote awareness.-Improving oversight and ensure completion of the project on schedule and within cost.Therefore, we are requesting approval of this baseline change request to reflect the conscious decision to delay deployment.Also added the total to the Target CY for the Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) Availability metric and updated the comment sections of the metrics.","1146,2778","Projects, Activities, Metrics","","","","04/19/2012","12:47:19","8021"

As a result, upon identification of the requirement to incorporate functionality that will allow agencies to maintain their current methods of budgetary reporting, the START project implementation date had to be pushed back ~ 9 months.The original CARS baseline did provide all stakeholders requirements to complete the transition from STAR to CARS including the revision and elimination of the STAR interfaces and execution of a comprehensive system wide test. Addition CARI releases to change all interfaces from the legacy system - STAR to CARS and to implement requested features that enable the Fiscal Projection System (nFPS) to align existing processes of budgetary reporting to the Monthly Treasury Statement once produced from the CARS.The BRS and ASR modules required additional releases to migrate remaining STAR reports to CARS and  implement the MTS Line Code in the data structures and in existing MTS reports developed in ASR 2.1.

The purpose of this BCR is to reflect the change in scope based on agreements reached by the Governance bodies to deliver the legislated functionality.FATCA FFI Registration Release 1.0 was originally intended to develop a web-based application that allows a Foreign Financial Institution (FFI) to apply for and become a Participating FFI (PFFI), with an agreement between the IRS and Foreign Financial Institutions.  The registration system would include a secure online document submission of the FFI registration form, agreement forms, deemed compliance forms as required (including electronic signature), periodic certifications and payment percentages for FFIs and their affiliates.FATCA FFI Registration Release 1.1 will follow the IGA model agreements changing the registration requirements by requiring the Host Country Tax Authorities (HCTAs) to take on increased governance responsibilities; As a result, IRS registration will be redesigned to streamline the registration process with three primary steps: Account Creation, Registration Form and Agreement, and Approval.This BCR establishes the FATCA FFI Registration Release 1.1 to deliver the agreed functionality in two Drops:-- Drop 1 (early July): FFI Registration Release 1.1 Drop 1 will focus on high priority and externally visible requirements-- Drop 2 (early October): will allow the IRS the ability to process FFI Registrations ","6383","Projects, Activities","2011-2019","","","03/07/2013","18:34:33","12385"

The Office of Management and Budget designated Treasury's Do Not Pay investment as a part of the working system identified in the IPERIA legislation. In order to support agencies in meeting this goal, Do Not Pay is leveraging Treasury's access to agency payment data and integrating Do Not Pay into the Treasury payment stream. In order to achieve the initial tight deadline established by IPERIA, the investment must modify in progress and planned projects for FY 13 and beyond.

These additional activities include preliminary design review support, propagation model tuning, implementation plans, and operational availability reports.  These activities were initially planned to be conducted by government personnel and  therefore the additional contractor support costs were not included in the initial baseline estimates.The Program Management Office responsible for managing the IWN feels that this required increase has minimal impact on the program.  Our ability to quickly increase the scope of our design efforts has had no effect on our NCR Design schedule. While the additional expenses are a burden in an already tight budget environment, our efficiencies in other program management areas have enabled us to cover the variance.","","","","1211.558214","2015-03-31","06/01/2010","14:48:23","697"

The BCR modifies the O and M and DME milestones for FY2011 through FY2015.  Milestones FY2012 through FY2015 were added.  Funding for FY2011 has increased by $3.914M.  The funding increase is in three areas.  The first is the hiring of 13 new FTE's in support of ACS.  The hiring will be done in two different phases.  The first is to do a contractor to federal (C2F) conversion as a cost saving effort, a maximum of 5 FTE.  ACS will also fill a needed training position from the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP).  There will be a transition of the ACSWeb application to the government once ACSWeb is rewritten.  Four Java FTEs will be added during FY2011 year.  Lastly, the Testing area has also increased their FTE base as a result of the additional testing needed for the ACSWeb rewrite.  The Testing area added 3 more FTE.    The second reason is increased contractor funding for the ACSWeb rewrite.  The ACSWeb rewrite will provide a replacement of the Attachmate Presentation Builder to Veristream Bridge Integrator.  ACS does not currently posses the knowledge to transition ACSWeb operation and maintenance once it is rewritten.  ACS has very limited knowledge of the ACSWeb application.  In an effort to bring the needed knowledge to the ACS, 4 Java programmers will be hired during FY2011.  The Java staff will work along side the contractors as they rewrite ACSWeb.  At the completion of the rewrite the ACSWeb maintenance will transition to the Government.  The transition will give the ACS Host the ability to increase the knowledge base, decrease contractor costs and increase our customer O","","","","62.334","2115-09-30","02/04/2011","13:56:24","2732"

The cut is assumed to extend through the project life cycle.  Total life cycle costs were reduced by $51.8M, of which $25.9M is contractor costs.  As mitigation, FIRST is adding two technical FTE resources, and training three existing technical FTE resources in Java development. 2)Elimination of baseline cost risk adjustments - The current baseline provided for cost risk adjustments based upon a comprehensive risk analysis.  Having gained experience and confidence with GTAS on the TWAI platform, and recognizing the realities of the current budget environment, the FIRST project team concluded that no additional resources are likely to be provided in the foreseeable future, and risk adjustments going forward will be to functional scope and performance, not cost increases.  Inflation factors were also changed to the latest A-94 Appendix C nominal interest rates.  Elimination of the risk adjustment and change in the inflation factors resulted in a decrease of $14.9M from life cycle costs.3) Elimination of GFRS Oracle license fees - The BPD/FMS Fiscal IT platform support will assume responsibility for GFRS's Oracle license fees.  This reduces project life cycle costs by $5.7M.4)Changes in scope and individual milestones - As a result of the loss of contractor funding, the FIRST project team reevaluated the scope of GTAS and made the following schedule and cost adjustments:a)Reduced from three to one the number of GTAS post-implementation enhancement releasesb)Redesigned scope so that GTAS provides GFRS with ATB data summarized by line item instead of providing detailed USSGL-based ATB datac)Reduced the scope of GTAS's management reportsd)Scaled back GTAS functionality to temporarily delete USSGL guidance information e)Redefined and rescheduled the final two preproduction GTAS development releases based upon functional scope and resource changes, with Release 4.0 starting April 4, 2011f)Added four GFRS development releases for its enhancements, beginning April 4, 2011g)Life cycle FTE costs were reduced by $1.7M and non-FTE, non-contractor, costs were reduced by $3.6M.5)Milestone Corrections - Correction to 100% actual % complete for 3 milestones closed early in the 2010 BCR, as the EVM metrics are distorted.","","","","62.292912","2025-12-31","05/12/2011","09:18:22","6013"

OMB imposed a funding constraint due to the high cost to deploy and too slow to yield tangible results. Capabilities were limited to Document Management, Records Management, and Case Workflow Management at the Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) offices. Expansion to other Treasury bureaus and implementation of Electronic Knowledge Content Management and Records Management Archive capabilities were deferred. Treasury contracted MITRE to perform a study that determined that a more modular approach to content management should be piloted at IRS-CI, OFAC, and FinCEN. The selected alternative was a Joint Development/Separate Deployment option for $63.6M with IRS-CI responsible for the first pilot deployment. OMB denied a IRS-CI TEOAF request to support the Investigative Scanning & Document Management (ISDM) pilot resulting in the discontinuation of the IDSM project. Per OMB direction, Treasury engaged Gartner to conduct an independent assessment of ECM to provide recommended strategies for an enterprise-wide content management system. Based on OMB guidance and results of the Gartner study, Treasury has determined that a scaled-down shared services approach with user provisioning and a well-structured governance model was required to meet the content management needs of the Bureaus and Departmental offices. The ECM IT initiative strategically unifies Treasury capabilities to electronically capture, store, search/analyze, share and manage documents. Treasury's new strategy for the ECM program is comprised of multiple document management projects, which are part of a scalable enterprise-wide initiative. ECM will provide the Department of the Treasury with the following functionalities: Correspondence Tracking, FOIA/e-Discovery, Collaboration, Evidence Management, Case Management, Paper Reduction, and an underlying Basic Content Services (BCS) Technology and Records Management foundation. The capabilities provided are built on the platform most suited for the business requirement -SharePoint 2010.  As a result of this new funding strategy, a BCR needs to be submitted to report against the most accurate (and current) baseline. ","","","","25.502","2015-09-30","02/28/2011","17:30:16","3703"

The resolution to the issues resulted in a scope expansion, additional rounds of testing, tighter integration with the Financial Management System (IFMS), and expanded rounds of deployment to reduce the risks associated with deployment as a whole. As a result, some pre-deployment and deployment milestones did not start as planned and costs were inappropriately assigned to these milestones.  An Integrated Baseline Review was performed, which included the request for removal of inaccurate milestones, since costs were placed in new milestones that more accurately depicted work being performed.  The issue now is that the new milestones were created but the old inaccurate milestones were not removed.As illustrated, costs are now being double counted and the incorrect milestones must be removed.
