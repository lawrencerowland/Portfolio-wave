The original goal of MAS was to utilize MAS throughout the five levels of the Medicare appeals process. This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process.
 
The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed.

MARCS is divided into a set of components. There are application and service components. The work flows in ORA will often cross multiple organizations and include a number of different user activity types such as screening, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, and compliance. The application components are designed to provide user groups with a one stop shop interface that will allow them to perform work from their user point of view. Functionality is only implemented once in a component. One user group work flow may use functionality from most of the MARCS components. This has implications for the management of MARCS. While the individual projects build out certain types of functionality, these need to be combined and coordinated into a whole in order to provide a useful work flow that covers the whole life cycle of a regulated product as it passes from one user group to the next. This combination and coordination needs to occur at the program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. PMTI includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI begins work on a release when it is time to start system integration testing. Work for a release includes system integration testing, promotion to the pre-production environment, performance testing, user acceptance testing, promotion to the production environment, security testing, and then release. Program management in this project includes release management and management of dependencies. This also includes system architecture, a road map, inter project coordination, decision analysis (for technology and platform selection), security work, user experience management (user friendly and consistent interface), inter project requirements management, status meetings, reports, risk management, and configuration management.

For ITACS, this will focus on account management (via Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS)) and additional functionality enabled by logins. For PREDICT, this will focus on building functionality to better manage rules. For PNM and CSI, this will focus on requirements. EM will provide functionality for screening, in conjunction with PREDICT, for the majority of the 20,000,000+ products imported via the 801(a) process annually. This will give import screeners and import compliance officers a unified interface for dealing with all of their work flows, including tracking Field Work (accomplished in Field Work Manager (FWM)). PREDICT is an expert system built around a rules engine that produces a risk-based score of imported products. Products with a low score are automatically sent forward by PREDICT. Products with a higher score require an import screener to review the product by using EM. ITACS is used to interface with import filers and industry to provide a conduit for supporting documentation.

This provides access to historical data from a number of systems, such as MARCS. The DW further contains a reporting database that retains the schema from the Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database from which information was originated. The DW has information in it that has been transformed into a star schema so that it is a Decision Support System (DSS). In addition, for some user communities, it is much more effective for them to only have to deal with a subset of all of the data in the DW. For such user communities, ORADSS has a number of Data Marts (DM) that certain designated users can use for querying. These are also used to support universes for reporting. ORADSS uses a COTS, Business Objects (BO), as a reporting tool. BO utilizes universes as a meta-data layer that allows for an abstraction of the underlying schema, table names, row names, and data types so that non technical users can access this data more easily. The universe structures may then be used to build reports. End users typically interact with the reports, but there are a number of end users who need to delve more deeply into the data than is allowed by a report.

FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information. This includes receiving firm information from registration and listing from the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS). FURLS is being partially replaced by eLIST. FMLS will integrate with eLIST (no acronym). The firm data is built around Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). These define a location and a product or a set of products. A large company may have multiple FEIs if it has multiple physical locations and/or produces different products that are regulated by FDA. This information is always changing as firms and market conditions change.  In addition, foreign firms that do not use a Latin alphabet present a particular problem as words can be transliterated into English in different ways. If this is left unchecked, it causes a proliferation of FEIs that are not all that useful in identifying what firm is what. To address this, FMLS employs Dataflux, a COTS, in implementing survivorship rules that are used to clean up this firm data and consolidate and remove FEIs. FMLS is also being integrated with Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB). DnB has one of the largest and most reliable databases on businesses in the world. This is being leveraged to improve the quality of firm information, especially that related to foreign firms.

This includes additional Center integration, gray area resolution, additional support for Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB) integration, and improved integration with  Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services (MARCS) Predictive Risk-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) for validating firm information. FDA receives much firm information via Center systems, including FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS) and eLIST (no acronym). This will focusing on improving and automating more of this information transfer. Gray area resolution is used to resolve uncertainties regarding firm information when the survivorship rules used in FMLS do not produce a clear resolution. Survivorship rules are implemented via the COTS Dataflux and are an automated way to correct firm data, merge, unmerge, and delete Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEI). Manual gray area resolution is performed to tweak survivorship rules and manually resolve information discrepancies. DnB integration will be expanded, including a review of the current firm inventory in ORA and matching these against DnB information to produce a confidence level from 1 to 10 (10 is highest confidence) to support estimating the risk associated with a firm based on the quality of firm information. This will be used to support risk based decisions such as used for import screening. The method used to validate firm information from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that is then used by PREDICT in import screening will be modified to improve this, reduce latency, reduce uncertainty, and reduce reprocessing. FMLS in RBIS is closely aligned with Firm Management Services (FMS) in MARCS. FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information.

RBIS will integrate data from other FRDA Business Centers and ORA repositories, to present a single view of data across FDA. RBIS will provide a single source of data for ORA's inspection locations (establishments) and provide services associated with these inspection locations. 

RBIS will enable centers to obtain establishment and ORA field operations data in order to implement workforce planning, establish food safety policies, and enforce compliance programs on regulated products. RBIS identifies and removes duplicate firms from ORA's inspection location inventory. RBIS provides web services to validate addresses and match firms within the establishment inventory.

RBIS will provide a search capability to view structured and unstructured data including: Field Accomplishment Computerized Tracking System (FACTS) inspection data, establishment inspection Reports, FDA 483 Observations report, firm details and history data, and recall information. RBIS includes a critical 24/7 application supporting field entry reviewers in the admissibility decisions of import operations. RBIS will provide over 25 Business Intelligence Universes for ad-hoc reporting, over 1,000 pre-defined reports and over 70,000 user-defined reports supporting a wide variety of functions across FDA.

RBIS will be used by ORA Investigators, Inspectors, Import Screeners, Supervisors, Branch Directors, District Directors, Technicians, Coordinators, State Contract Monitors, Compliance Officers, and Planners, Program Managers, Firm Data Stewards, and Risk-based Input users.

In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established.  
 
The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors. 
 
Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy.

Goal: To provide upgraded camera suites with additional surveillance tools, replace the current analog system with a digital system necessary for Certification & Accreditation, and provide modern command and control (C2) facilities to incorporate additional situational awareness capabilities.

Current and Anticipated Benefits: Increased situational awareness while leveraging the added range of cameras systems; and replacement of the current analog system with a more secure digital system.

Mission Delivery Contribution: The RVSS Upgrade Program supports both the DHS Strategic Goal 2.1: ""Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders"" and CBP Strategic Goal 2: ""Advance Comprehensive Border Security and Management."" This includes preventing the illegal entry of people, weapons, dangerous goods, and contraband, and protecting against cross-border threats to health, food, environment, and agriculture, while facilitating the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce, as well as preventing the illegal export of weapons, proceeds of crime, and other dangerous goods. The program will enhance the current mission through early detection of border incursions, through enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and the ability to track items of interest through a law enforcement resolution. The program will enhance agent and public safety through persistent surveillance in high enforcement areas.

Under the capitated model of the financial alignment demonstrations, the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office is working with participating States to test a new payment and service delivery model to improve the quality of care that individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (Medicare-Medicaid enrollees) receive.  The goals are to expand access to seamless, integrated programs, while reducing expenditures under Medicare and Medicaid, and enhancing the quality of care furnished. 
This project modifies the existing Encounter Data System (EDS) for purposes of processing those encounter data described as being Medicare services to develop the capability to price the MMP health care encounter data to be able to estimate the cost of a dually eligible beneficiary enrolled in an MMP. For those encounter data described as being Medicaid services, the data is collected, edited at the translator level and stored along with the Medicare services encounter data in the CMS Repository. Under this project a copy of all encounter data submitted by the MMPs is also sent to the corresponding State Medicaid Agency. The project includes analysis, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance of the Medicare Medicaid Data System (MMDS), including modifications to EDS, as well as operational and policy training to MMPs and other entities. Inherent existing functionality of the EDS, such as identification of diagnoses codes to be sent to the Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS), processing and submitting Part D Events is included.

ISG vision is to architect, build, and support innovative health care IT systems which focus on optimizing CCSQ clinical standards and quality programs.
The goal is to ensure that these common business functions are supported through a common architecture and system for submission of data, parsing, staging and processing the data to a common data framework that does not duplicate data stores, but allows for the proper business intelligence and measure calculations to be run against an integrated data framework. The framework and design should accommodate both the reporting and file outputs in the most efficient manner. The time required to make changes, should be minimal without requiring entire systems to be redeveloped, but only modular components. All business functions should be handled through the design and implementation of scalable enterprise services, and that perform to the expected load.
While the LOBs are moving forward with their business needs, Enterprise Services oversees all technical functional areas, assuring that the technology proposed within the Targeted Enterprise Architecture (TEA) is within the LOB's need.",2015-05-07,2016-06-30,37,"4 - Agile",,yes,,"1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",0,0,Green,-0.804,-3.77,Green,Completed,07/27/2016,05:32:37

With 250+ operating locations, DLA users at all locations must be able to use networked computing devices (laptops, desktops, thin clients, etc..), land line phones, video teleconferencing equipment, and well as cell phones / DPA / smartphones where required.  The communications infrastructure expenditures fall into  five main areas:  1.  Building and maintaining  a capability for the DLA employees, 2.  Monitoring it for availability, 3.  Troubleshooting and repairing it when outages occur, 4.  Secureing it against threats, and 4.  Maintaining it through lifecycle refresh.  Item one includes the initial purchase of such items as Network switches/routers, network circuits, intrusion prevention and detection devices, firewalls, network sniffers, phones, VTC equipment, Satcomm equipment, and phones, in addition to support personnel to maintain the equipment through patching and researching patches required to maintain STIG compliance and accreditation of the equipment.  Item two includes software and hardware, plus personnel support  to monitor.  Item three requires specialized hardware and software be maintained in order to properly find and resolve issues.  Issues may take the form of network circuit degradation or complete outage, degradation or complete loss of service, hardware malfunction or failure.  Most outages take many man-hours to pinpoint, and then develop and implement a solution.  Item four also requires dedicated and specialized hardware, software, and personnel.  The hardware include Firewalls, intrusion detection devices for monitoring, proxy servers, reverse web proxy devices, and web content filtering devices.
