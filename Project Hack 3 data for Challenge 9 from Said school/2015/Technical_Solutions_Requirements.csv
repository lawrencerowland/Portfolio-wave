Additionally, the 9/11 Act mandated that TSA establish a system to screen 100% of cargo transported on passenger aircraft by August 2010. The Air Cargo Security investment consists of three systems that enable TSA to meet these statutory requirements. The KSMS allows IACs and ACs to submit shipper information to TSA for vetting as a known shipper as required by the ATSA. IACMS supports TSA's regulation of IACs, provides companies with the ability to submit applications to become an IAC, and provides the capability for companies to request STAs for their employees as required by the ATSA and 9/11 Act.

In the GAO-06-76 report, the GAO found that the Known Shipper database's effectiveness was limited and this limits TSA's ability to identify shippers who may pose a security threat.  The report also recommended that the data used in the Freight Assessment System to identify elevated risk cargo are complete, accurate, and current.

Similarly, the applicable SSP states that indirect air carriers (IACs), air carriers, and agents must submit their STAs through the Indirect Air Carrier Management System (IACMS) and IACs must complete certification applications and renewal requests through this system.
